zero future. we recognize that progress won ’ t always be linear, and the rate at which we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time. on the path to becoming water positive, we invested in 21 water replenishment projects that are expected to generate over 1. 3 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits in nine water basins around the world. progress toward our zero waste commitment included diverting more than 15, 200 metric tons of solid waste otherwise headed to landfills and incinerators, as well as launching new circular centers to increase reuse and reduce e -

and third - party content, as well as advertising. growth of our gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through xbox enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first - party content creators. search and news advertising our search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global audience. we have several partnerships with other companies, including yahoo, through which we provide and monetize search queries. growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with', 'relevant content and advertiser offerings. on june 6, 2022, we acquired xandr, inc., a technology platform with tools to accelerate the delivery of our digital advertising solutions. competition windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from apple and google. we believe windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy -

and asset - backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally - developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these', 'vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker - priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker - priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period -

alone selling price ( “ ssp ” ) for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on - premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services. in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and', 'geographic region in determining the ssp. due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. impairment of investment securities we review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value,', 'we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this', 'every organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power. with our new microsoft intelligent data', '43 judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income ( expense ), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and / or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. we perform a', 'qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income ( expense ), net. goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level ( operating segment or one level below an operating segment ) on an annual basis ( may 1 for us ) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or', 'circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long - term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.', 'the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. research and development costs costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high - risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this', 'occurs shortly before the products are released to production. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.', '44 income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity ’ s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 % likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets', 'and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. inventories inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include', 'analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. change in accounting estimate in july 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of june 30, 2022, it is estimated this', 'change will increase our fiscal year 2023 operating income by $ 3. 7 billion. we had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in july 2020.', '45 statement of management ’ s responsibility for financial statements management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management ’ s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.', '5 platform, we are helping customers focus on creating value instead of integrating a fragmented data estate. cosmos db is the go -

based valuation techniques ( e. g. the black - scholes model ) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market -

based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. our level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. we measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. the fair values of these', 'investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. inventories inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight -
