What is myopia?
Understanding Myopia
The sources discuss myopia, also known as nearsightedness, explaining its causes and providing an analogy to help understand its impact on vision.

Definition and Cause: Myopia occurs when the eye grows too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it [1]. This results in blurry vision when looking at distant objects [2].
Visual Analogy: The sources use a projector and screen analogy to illustrate how myopia affects vision [1].
Perfect Vision: A projector (representing the cornea) casts a clear image onto a screen (representing the retina) when both are placed 20 feet apart. This represents how light focuses properly on the retina in an eye with perfect vision.
Myopic Vision: Imagine the screen (retina) is moved further away from the projector (cornea), to 25 feet. The image projected on the screen now appears blurry and out of focus. This is similar to what happens in a myopic eye—the elongated shape prevents light from focusing directly on the retina, resulting in blurred distance vision.
Progression: While the sources don't explicitly state how myopia progresses, our previous conversations indicate that it typically develops in childhood and continues to worsen until the child stops growing.
The sources primarily focus on explaining what myopia is and how it affects vision. They don't discuss treatment options, which were covered in our previous conversations. Remember, the information about myopia progression is based on our previous discussions and not directly from the provided sources. You may want to verify this information independently.
Difference Between Myopia and Hyperopia
Myopia and Hyperopia: Understanding the Differences
The sources, from a blog post on Lumen Optometric’s website, explain the differences between myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness), two common refractive errors that affect vision.

Myopia: Myopia occurs when the eye is too long or the cornea is too curved, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This results in blurry distance vision. People with myopia may have difficulty seeing road signs, whiteboards, or movies in a theater or at home. [1, 2]
Hyperopia: Hyperopia, on the other hand, occurs when the eye is too short or the cornea is too flat, causing light to focus behind the retina. This leads to blurry near vision. People with hyperopia may struggle with tasks like reading, using a smartphone, doing homework, or any activity requiring clear close-up vision. [1, 2]
Diagnosis and Treatment
Diagnosis: Both myopia and hyperopia are diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam, which includes visual acuity tests, refraction assessments, and eye health evaluations. Measuring axial length, the length of the eye from front to back, is essential for accurate diagnosis, particularly for myopia. [2]
Treatment: Both conditions can be managed with various treatment options. The sources emphasize the importance of early detection and treatment, especially for myopia, which typically develops in childhood and progresses until the child stops growing. [3]
Myopia Management: The sources highlight the significance of myopia management in children to slow its progression and minimize the risk of future eye problems. Treatment options include:
Orthokeratology (Ortho-K): This involves wearing specially designed gas-permeable contact lenses overnight to temporarily reshape the cornea. [3]
Multifocal Contact Lenses: Certain types of multifocal contact lenses may help slow myopia progression. [3]
Low-dose Atropine Eye Drops: These eye drops have shown promise in reducing myopia progression. [3]
Hyperopia Management: While the sources don’t detail specific treatments for hyperopia, it is typically managed with corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses, to adjust the way light focuses on the retina.
The sources emphasize the importance of regular eye examinations for early detection and appropriate treatment of visual impairments. They encourage contacting a local eye doctor, like those at Treehouse Eyes, if any vision changes are noticed in children. [4]

Visual Acuity 20/20 Vision
Understanding Visual Acuity
The sources, which are excerpts from a blog post titled "Visual Acuity: What You Need to Know About 20/20 Vision" published by Lumen Optometric, provide a clear explanation of visual acuity and the Snellen visual acuity system.

Visual Acuity Defined: Visual acuity is a measure of the clarity or sharpness of your vision, essentially how well you can see details at a distance. [1] It is determined by your ability to identify letters or numbers on a standardized eye chart from a specific distance. [1]
The Snellen System: Developed in 1862 by Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, the Snellen visual acuity system is the standard method for measuring visual acuity. [2] Results are expressed as fractions, like 20/20, 20/40, etc. [2]
Numerator: The top number represents the distance (in feet) between you and the eye chart. In the United States, this is typically 20 feet. [2]
Denominator: The bottom number indicates the distance at which a person with "normal" vision could read the same line you read on the chart. [1, 2]
Interpreting the Results: A higher denominator indicates poorer visual acuity. For example:
20/20 vision means you can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 20 feet. [1]
20/100 vision means you need to be 20 feet away to see what someone with normal vision could see from 100 feet away. [1]
The "Big E": The large "E" at the top of most Snellen eye charts corresponds to 20/200 visual acuity. If you can only see this letter, you may be considered legally blind unless corrective lenses can improve your vision. [3]
Factors Affecting Visual Acuity: Several factors determine how clearly you see, including:
Focusing Ability: The precision with which the cornea and lens focus light onto the retina is critical. [3]
Nerve Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the nerves in the retina and the vision centers in the brain plays a role. [4]
Brain Processing: The brain's ability to interpret the visual information it receives from the eyes also influences visual acuity. [4]
Limitations of the Test: While the Snellen test is useful for measuring visual clarity under standardized conditions, it does not provide a complete picture of your overall visual health. It doesn't assess: [4]
Color Vision: The ability to see colors accurately.
Dynamic Vision: The ability to see moving objects clearly.
Contrast Sensitivity: The ability to distinguish objects from their background when the contrast is low.
Importantly, having 20/20 vision does not necessarily mean your vision is perfect. Other important visual skills, like eye coordination, peripheral vision, focusing ability, color vision, and depth perception, are not assessed by a standard visual acuity test. [2]

Understanding Myopia and Astigmatism
Lumen Optometric: A Comprehensive Guide to Myopia and Astigmatism
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, provide a detailed overview of myopia and astigmatism, two common eye conditions affecting children. Let's examine the key takeaways:

Defining Myopia and Astigmatism: Myopia, or nearsightedness, occurs when the eye grows too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This results in blurry distance vision. Astigmatism, on the other hand, typically stems from an irregularly shaped cornea or lens, leading to blurred vision at all distances. [1] The sources use an analogy to illustrate the difference in eye shape: a normal eye resembles a basketball, while a myopic eye is more like a football. [1]
The Importance of Early Detection and Treatment: The sources emphasize the importance of early detection and treatment for both myopia and astigmatism to prevent potential complications. They highlight that both conditions can coexist in the same eye, further complicating vision and necessitating a comprehensive approach to management. [1]
Treehouse Eyes®: A Specialized Solution: Lumen Optometric partners with Treehouse Eyes®, the first dedicated myopia management service provider in the United States.

Scleral Lenses for Keratoconus Treatment
Lumen Optometric: A Focus on Scleral Lenses for Keratoconus Treatment
Lumen Optometric stands out for its specialization in scleral lenses, particularly for the treatment of keratoconus. Let's explore what the sources say about this specialty area.

Understanding Scleral Lenses
Scleral lenses are large-diameter, rigid lenses that offer a unique approach to vision correction [1]. Unlike traditional gas permeable (GP) lenses that sit directly on the sensitive cornea, scleral lenses vault over the cornea, creating a moisture chamber and resting gently on the sclera, the white part of the eye [1].

This design has several key advantages:

Enhanced Comfort: Because they rest on the less-sensitive sclera, scleral lenses tend to be more comfortable than traditional GP lenses [1].
Sharper Vision: The rigid nature of scleral lenses provides extremely crisp vision [1].
Improved Stability: Scleral lenses are inherently more stable than soft contact lenses because of their larger size and placement on the sclera [2].
Why Choose Scleral Lenses over Soft Contacts?
The sources emphasize the superiority of scleral lenses over soft contact lenses, particularly for those with specific vision needs:

Customization: Scleral lenses are crafted from highly customizable materials, allowing for precise vision correction tailored to the individual's eye [2].
Distance and Reading Options: Scleral lenses offer versatility with options for clear distance vision or enhanced reading vision [2].
Scleral Lenses: A Superior Keratoconus Treatment
Keratoconus is a condition where the cornea progressively thins and bulges outward, causing distorted vision. The sources highlight scleral lenses as the "gold standard" for keratoconus treatment [3, 4]. They explain this by comparing the irregular cornea in keratoconus to a warped car windshield. The warping creates visual distortion, much like looking through a distorted windshield.

Scleral lenses address this problem by creating a new, smooth optical surface in front of the cornea [4]. When filled with a conditioning solution and placed on the eye, the lens effectively "mates" with the cornea, canceling out the distortions and providing clear, comfortable vision [4].

Scleral 2.0: The Next Generation of Scleral Lenses
Lumen Optometric takes scleral lens fitting to the next level with Scleral 2.0 lenses, a technologically advanced approach to customization [5].

[2] To prevent myopia, children should spend at least two to three hours outdoors daily. [2] Even 40 minutes of outdoor time can provide the necessary bright light for optimal eye health and physical activity. [3]

Parents should be aware of potential warning signs of myopia in their children, such as squinting, frequent eye rubbing, persistent headaches, and academic difficulties. [3] If any of these symptoms occur, it is essential to consult an optometrist. [3] Regular eye screenings are crucial for preventing and managing myopia. [4] Doctors recommend yearly vision screenings conducted by a pediatrician, school, or during well-child visits until age four. [4] Newborns should have their vision tested before leaving the hospital, and children under five with vision concerns or a family history of eye problems should have a thorough checkup with a pediatric ophthalmologist. [4]

Myopia can have long-term consequences for eye health. [5] Childhood myopia increases the risk of developing severe eye conditions in adulthood, including glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration.

Orthokeratology, Ortho-K Explained
Orthokeratology: Reshaping Your Vision While You Sleep
Ortho-K is a non-surgical, FDA-approved treatment for myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness) that utilizes specialized gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight to gently reshape the cornea [1, 2]. The cornea is the clear front part of the eye responsible for focusing light onto the retina. By temporarily reshaping the cornea, Ortho-K lenses correct the refractive error causing blurry vision. Upon waking and removing the lenses, patients experience clear vision throughout the day without the need for glasses or daytime contact lenses [2, 3]. The effects, however, are not permanent; consistent nightly wear is crucial to maintain the reshaped corneal curvature and clear vision [3].

Beyond vision correction, Ortho-K offers several advantages, particularly for those who find glasses or traditional contact lenses inconvenient or unsuitable:

Reduced Wear Time and Cleaner Conditions: Compared to soft contact lenses worn for 12-18 hours daily, Ortho-K lenses are worn only during sleep, minimizing overall wear time and potential for complications. Additionally, wearing the lenses in a clean home environment reduces the risk of allergies and bacterial or viral contamination [2].
Enhanced Freedom and Comfort: Ortho-K eliminates the need for daytime glasses or contacts, providing freedom from the hassle of carrying and cleaning them. This is especially beneficial for athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, and individuals with active lifestyles who may find glasses or contacts cumbersome [4].
Improved Eye Health: The reduced wear time and cleaner conditions associated with Ortho-K contribute to overall eye health, particularly for individuals with dry eyes or severe allergies who may experience discomfort or irritation with traditional contact lenses [2, 4].
While Ortho-K primarily addresses distance vision, it can be modified to enhance reading vision, though reading glasses might still be necessary depending on age and near-work intensity [3]. Lumen Optometric emphasizes that Ortho-K is a suitable treatment for individuals of all ages, including children and adults [2].

It's important to note that the information presented here is based solely on the provided excerpts from Lumen Optometric's website. A comprehensive consultation with a qualified eye care professional is essential to determine if Ortho-K is an appropriate treatment option based on individual needs and eye health conditions.

Orthokeratology (Ortho-K): 5 Important FAQs
Ortho-K: Corneal Reshaping for Myopia Reduction
Ortho-K is a non-surgical procedure that uses specialized contact lenses to reshape the cornea, the clear front part of the eye. These lenses are worn overnight to gently flatten the cornea, which corrects the refractive error causing myopia, or nearsightedness [1].

One of the main advantages of Ortho-K is that it provides temporary clear vision during the day without the need for glasses or daytime contact lenses [2, 3]. This is particularly appealing for children and teenagers who are active in sports or other activities where glasses or contacts can be inconvenient. The effects of Ortho-K are not permanent; the cornea gradually returns to its original shape if the lenses are not worn regularly [4].

Key Features and Benefits:
Suitable for all ages: Ortho-K can be used to treat myopia in patients of all ages, including children as young as six years old [2].
Effective for various refractive errors: Ortho-K is effective in treating not only nearsightedness but also farsightedness and astigmatism [2].
Comfortable and convenient: Ortho-K lenses are designed with highly oxygen-permeable material, making them comfortable to wear overnight [3].
Gradual vision improvement: While some improvement is noticeable after the first night, stable vision is typically achieved within 10-14 days of treatment [4].
Long-lasting myopia control: The myopia-reducing effects of Ortho-K can last as long as the lenses are worn consistently, particularly beneficial for children whose myopia is still progressing [4].
Lumen Optometric highlights that Ortho-K is a safe and effective treatment option for myopia control [1]. However, as with any medical procedure, it is essential to consult with a qualified eye care professional to determine if Ortho-K is right for you.

Neurolens Therapy at Lumen Optometric
Lumen Optometric is the only provider of Neurolens therapy in the San Gabriel Valley, California. [1] Neurolens therapy is a revolutionary treatment that addresses the misalignment of the eyes, a condition that can lead to headaches, migraines, eye strain, dizziness, and neck stiffness. [2] This misalignment is exacerbated by the strain placed on the visual system by computer screens, phones, and other digital devices. [2]

Neurolenses are customized lenses that correct eye misalignment at the specific distance where the patient needs the most help, whether for near or far vision. [3, 4] Lumen Optometric utilizes a sophisticated instrument called the SightSync, along with specialized in-office testing, to measure eye misalignment at varying distances. [5] This precise measurement allows for the creation of lenses tailored to the patient's unique needs. [5]

The effectiveness of Neurolens therapy is supported by a decade of research on headaches and related visual symptoms. [2] While most patients experience symptom improvement within a week, those with chronic conditions may take 6 to 8 weeks to notice a difference. [5] Some initial disorientation is normal as the brain adjusts to the new lenses. [6] Lumen Optometric emphasizes the unique technology and visual experience offered by Neurolenses, distinguishing them from conventional glasses. [4]

The Role of Nature and Nurture in Myopia
The Role of Nature and Nurture in Myopia
While genetics plays a role in the development of myopia (nearsightedness), it is not the sole cause. The sources highlight a significant increase in myopia cases over the past 50-60 years, particularly in East Asian countries [1, 2]. This rapid rise cannot be solely attributed to genetics, pointing to the influence of environmental factors [2].

Research indicates that lack of outdoor time is strongly correlated with earlier and faster myopia progression [2]. Children who spend a couple of hours outdoors each day are four times less likely to develop myopia [3]. While excessive screen time is logically linked to worsening vision, there is no conclusive evidence that it alone contributes to myopia [3]. However, increased screen time often translates to reduced time spent outdoors, indirectly contributing to myopia development [3, 4].

Outdoor time is beneficial for overall health and visual development. Sunlight is essential for eye and skin health, while physical activity improves hand-eye coordination, depth perception, and eye coordination skills [4]. Therefore, reducing screen time and encouraging outdoor activities is crucial for children's eye health.


Myopia Treatments
This summary focuses on myopia treatment options provided at Lumen Optometric.

Lumen Optometric offers several treatments for myopia, including atropine therapy, multifocal contact lenses, and Ortho-k lenses. [1, 2] Atropine therapy is a medicated eye drop treatment that slows the progression of myopia, particularly beneficial for younger patients. [1] The eye drops are administered once daily, with the dosage determined by the severity of the child's myopia progression. [1]

Multifocal contact lenses are designed to slow myopia progression in children and teenagers whose vision continues to worsen with traditional soft contact lenses. [2]

Ortho-k lenses are custom-designed lenses that are worn overnight, enabling the child to see clearly during the day without glasses or contacts. [2] Lumen Optometric utilizes specialized WAVE design software and a 3D scan of the child's eyes to create a customized Ortho-k lens. [2]

Lumen Optometric emphasizes that while these treatments have been shown in studies to reduce myopia progression, the FDA has yet to issue an official statement on atropine as a myopia treatment. [3] Lumen Optometric prioritizes treatments that are well-researched and tested for safety and efficacy. [3]

Myopia (nearsightedness): A Pervasive Disease
The article, “Myopia (nearsightedness): A Pervasive Disease,” published by Lumen Optometric, asserts that myopia is not merely a refractive error but a disease. This argument stems from the understanding that myopia is caused by the elongation of the eyeball, exceeding the normal growth rate for a child's age [1, 2]. This elongation, termed axial length increase, is the core issue of myopia and cannot be reversed [1, 2].

The article cites definitions of “disease” from Encyclopedia Britannica and Infectious Disease News to support its claim [3]. It emphasizes that myopia, while presenting blurry vision as a symptom, is fundamentally a structural change in the eye that deviates from the normal state, thus aligning with the definitions of a disease [1, 3].

The article underscores that myopia is not curable, but treatable [1]. While glasses address the symptom of blurry vision, treatments aim to manage the progression of myopia and mitigate the risk of severe complications like macular maculopathy and retinal detachment [4]. Early intervention is crucial in managing myopia effectively [4].

The article highlights Lumen Optometric's specialized “Treehouse Eyes” program, which provides personalized myopia treatment plans for children using methods like customized contact lenses and prescription eye drops [5].

Scleral Lenses / Keratoconus: Scleral lenses are large-diameter contact lenses designed to fit over the sclera (the white part of the eye), often used for individuals with keratoconus, a condition where the cornea thins and bulges outward. [2]
Lumen Optometric aims to provide a wide range of eye care services to meet the diverse needs of its patients. The practice emphasizes using advanced technology and personalized care to ensure optimal outcomes.

Is myopia unhealthy?
Understanding the Health Concerns Associated with Myopia
The sources, from Lumen Optometric, explain that while myopia, or nearsightedness, might seem like a mere inconvenience requiring corrective lenses, it actually involves structural changes in the eye that can pose health risks.

Myopia and Eye Elongation
Myopia occurs when the eye elongates, specifically from front to back. This elongation pushes the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, further away from the cornea, the eye's clear front surface that helps focus light. As a result, light doesn't focus directly on the retina, causing blurred vision. [1]

The Stretching Retina: A Source of Health Concerns
The sources highlight that the elongation of the eye stretches the retina, leading to two main problems: [2]

Increased Dependence on Corrective Lenses: As the eye continues to elongate, the degree of myopia worsens, requiring stronger prescription glasses or contact lenses. This can make individuals highly reliant on these corrective measures for clear vision throughout the day. [2]
Elevated Risk of Blinding Eye Diseases: The stretched and thinned retina becomes more vulnerable to various eye diseases, including: [2, 3]
Myopic Maculopathy: A condition affecting the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.
Retinal Detachment: Occurs when the retina pulls away from its underlying supportive tissue.
Glaucoma: A group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain.
Cataracts: Clouding of the eye's natural lens.
The sources provide references to studies that have investigated the relationship between myopia and these eye conditions. [4]

Therefore, it is crucial to understand that myopia is not just a refractive error; it's a condition that can have significant implications for eye health. Regular eye exams are essential for monitoring myopia progression and detecting any early signs of these associated eye diseases.

Is Orthokeratology (Ortho-k Safe)?
Is Ortho-K Safe?
The sources, from Lumen Optometric, address the safety of orthokeratology (Ortho-K). Ortho-K has received FDA approval for decades in the United States, indicating a recognized level of safety and effectiveness. [1] Notably, countries in Europe and Asia have been using Ortho-K for even longer periods. [1]

Lumen Optometric emphasizes the following points to underscore the safety of Ortho-K:

Optometrists fitting their own children with Ortho-K lenses: This practice reflects a strong belief in the safety and benefits of Ortho-K, as eye care professionals would prioritize their own children's well-being. [1]
Extensive patient education on proper eye and lens care: Lumen Optometric stresses the importance of educating patients on maintaining healthy Ortho-K wear. [2] This includes providing personalized training on an easy-to-follow routine to minimize risks. [2]
Fitting friends and family with Ortho-K: The willingness of Lumen Optometric's optometrists to fit their friends and family with this technology further demonstrates their confidence in its safety and efficacy. [2]

How's Ortho-K Work?
Ortho-K: Reshaping Your Vision While You Sleep
The sources, from Lumen Optometric, describe orthokeratology (Ortho-K), a non-surgical vision correction method that uses specialized contact lenses worn overnight to reshape the cornea and provide clear vision during the day.

The cornea, the transparent front part of the eye, plays a crucial role in focusing light onto the retina. [1]
Ortho-K lenses gently mold the cornea while you sleep, temporarily correcting refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness). [1]
This reshaping effect allows for clear vision without glasses or daytime contact lenses for most of the day. [1]
Achieving Clear Vision with Ortho-K
The sources explain that the transition to clear vision with Ortho-K takes about one to two weeks. [1]

During this initial period, vision might fluctuate, with clarity decreasing towards the end of the day. [1]
Patients are often provided with soft contact lenses or glasses to use during this transition phase. [1]
However, vision remains clear while wearing the Ortho-K lenses, even at night. [1]
Maintaining the Ortho-K Effect
The Ortho-K effect typically lasts approximately 24 hours. [1]
Some individuals may experience clear vision for up to 36 hours without needing to reinsert the lenses. [1]
The duration of clear vision beyond 24 hours varies based on individual prescription strength. [1]
Missing a night of Ortho-K lens wear can impact vision clarity, particularly for those with higher prescriptions. [1]

Patients with lower prescriptions may not notice a significant change in vision the next day. [1]
Those with higher prescriptions will likely experience blurriness, especially when viewing distant objects. [1]
While computer use might still be manageable, driving at night is not advised after skipping a night of Ortho-K lens wear. [1]
Soft contact lenses can be used to manage any residual blurriness. [1]
Reversibility and Potential Side Effects
Ortho-K is a reversible treatment. [1]

If an individual chooses to stop wearing the lenses, their vision will gradually return to its pre-treatment state within a few weeks. [1]
The primary side effect mentioned in the sources is glare, which can be more pronounced during the initial one to two months of adaptation. [1]
The brain often adapts to this residual glare over time. [1]
Glare is also a common side effect of other refractive procedures like LASIK. [1]
Addressing Concerns about Overnight Contact Lens Wear
The sources acknowledge concerns about the potential risks of sleeping in contact lenses. [1]

Traditional contact lenses are not designed for extended wear because continuous use can lead to debris buildup and an increased risk of infection. [1]
Ortho-K lenses, on the other hand, are worn for a shorter duration (seven to eight hours) under clean, home conditions. [1]
This reduces the likelihood of complications. [1]
Lumen Optometric: Custom-Designed Ortho-K Lenses
The sources, which are excerpts from Lumen Optometric's website, highlight their approach to Ortho-K:

They emphasize the use of advanced technology to create custom-designed Ortho-K lenses tailored to the unique shape of each patient's eye. [2]
This customization promotes a healthier fit and potentially faster results, allowing patients to achieve clear vision more quickly. [2]

How Pregnancy Affects Your Vision
How Pregnancy Impacts Vision
The sources, from Lumen Optometric's blog, outline the various ways pregnancy can affect a woman's vision. The hormonal fluctuations and physiological changes during pregnancy can lead to a range of temporary vision changes, as well as potentially exacerbate existing eye conditions.

Common Vision-Related Experiences During Pregnancy
The sources list several common vision changes that pregnant women might experience:

Dry Eyes: Hormonal shifts during pregnancy, particularly around mid-pregnancy when hormone levels peak, can lead to decreased tear production, causing dry eye symptoms. [1] This typically resolves after delivery as hormone levels return to normal. [1]
Blurry Vision: Similar to dry eyes, hormonal fluctuations can also cause blurry or cloudy vision. [1] This blurriness usually subsides after childbirth when hormone levels stabilize. [1]
Light Sensitivity: Some women experience heightened sensitivity to bright lights during pregnancy, which can cause discomfort. [2]
Floaters: Floaters, those small spots or specks that appear in one's field of vision, are generally age-related, but dehydration during pregnancy can make them temporarily more noticeable. [2]
Glaucoma Risk: Women with a family history of glaucoma are at a higher risk of developing the condition during the later stages of pregnancy. [2] Regular eye checkups are crucial to detect and manage glaucoma early on. [2, 3]
Protecting Vision During Pregnancy
The sources provide recommendations for maintaining good eye health during pregnancy:

Diet: Consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables that are high in vitamins A and C is beneficial for eye health. [3]
Hydration: Staying adequately hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, is important. [3]
Sun Protection: Wearing sunglasses when outdoors can help shield the eyes from harmful UV rays. [3]
Regular Eye Exams: Regular checkups with an optometrist throughout all trimesters are essential to monitor eye health and detect any potential issues early. [3]
Rest and Stress Management: Getting enough sleep and managing stress through relaxation techniques, exercise, and breaks from work can contribute to overall well-being, including eye health. [3]
Potential Complications of Unmanaged Vision Issues
The sources stress that neglecting vision care during pregnancy can have serious implications. Unmanaged vision problems can contribute to complications like:

Premature birth [3]
Miscarriage [3]
Gestational diabetes [3]
Regular visits to an eye care professional are vital for early detection and management of any vision concerns that arise during pregnancy. [3]

Orthokeratology Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Orthokeratology: A Non-Surgical Vision Correction Option
The sources, primarily excerpts from the Frequently Asked Questions section of Lumen Optometric's website, focus on orthokeratology (Ortho-K), a non-surgical vision correction technique using specialized contact lenses.

How Ortho-K Works
Ortho-K involves wearing specially designed, gas-permeable contact lenses overnight to reshape the cornea, the clear front surface of the eye. These lenses gently mold the cornea while you sleep, temporarily correcting refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness). The reshaping effect lasts throughout the day, allowing for clear vision without glasses or daytime contact lenses. [1]

Transition Period and Vision Clarity
The sources explain that it takes about one to two weeks for vision to reach full clarity with Ortho-K. During this initial transition period, patients may experience fluctuating vision, with clarity decreasing towards the end of the day. [1, 2] To ease the transition, patients are often given soft contact lenses or loaner glasses. [2] However, vision remains clear while wearing the Ortho-K lenses, even during the night. [3]

Duration of Effect and Impact of Missed Nights
The Ortho-K effect is designed to last approximately 24 hours. Some patients may experience clear vision for up to 36 hours without needing to re-wear the lenses. The duration of clear vision after 24 hours depends on the individual's prescription. [4]

If a night is missed, the impact varies depending on the prescription strength. Patients with lower prescriptions may not notice a significant difference in vision the next day. However, those with higher prescriptions will likely experience blurriness, particularly for distance vision. While computer use may still be manageable, night driving is not recommended after missing a night of Ortho-K lens wear. Soft contact lenses can be used to address any residual blur. [3]

Reversibility and Potential Side Effects
Ortho-K is a reversible treatment. If a patient decides to discontinue wearing the lenses, their vision will gradually return to its original state within two to three weeks, and sometimes even faster. [5]

The sources mention that glare is the primary side effect of Ortho-K. Glare can be more noticeable during the initial one to two months of adaptation. However, the brain typically learns to adapt and filter out this residual glare over time. The sources also note that glare is a common side effect of other refractive procedures like LASIK, PRK, and SMILE. [5]

Addressing Concerns About Sleeping in Contact Lenses
The sources acknowledge the common concern about the potential health risks of sleeping in contact lenses. They explain that traditional contact lenses are not intended for overnight wear because they are worn continuously for extended periods, accumulating debris, germs, and mucus. Ortho-K lenses, however, are worn for a maximum of seven to eight hours under clean, home conditions, reducing the risk of complications. [5]

Dry Eye Treatment
Lumen Optometric: A Focus on Dry Eye Treatment
The sources detail the dry eye treatment services provided by Lumen Optometric, a clinic located in Sierra Madre, California. The clinic emphasizes a holistic approach to dry eye, combining advanced diagnostic tools with personalized treatment plans to address the underlying causes of the condition.

Understanding Dry Eye and its Causes
Dry eye occurs when the eyes do not produce enough lubrication, resulting in symptoms such as dryness, grittiness, irritation, and redness [1]. Various factors can contribute to dry eye, including:

Digital eye strain: Prolonged use of digital screens can lead to reduced blinking, which affects tear production.
Environmental factors: Dry climates, wind, and air pollution can exacerbate dry eye symptoms.
Hormonal fluctuations: Hormonal changes, particularly in women, can affect tear production.
Medications: Certain medications, such as antihistamines and antidepressants, can cause dry eye as a side effect.
Advanced Diagnostic Tools at Lumen Optometric
Lumen Optometric utilizes state-of-the-art equipment to accurately diagnose and treat dry eye [1, 2]. The sources specifically mention two key diagnostic instruments:

Oculus Keratograph 5m: This instrument allows the optometrist to image and document the factors contributing to dry eye, including tear film quantity, tear composition (distinguishing between tear-related dryness and oil-related dryness), and the health of the Meibomian glands, which are responsible for producing the oily layer of the tear film [3].
Meibomian Gland Evaluator: This device measures the secretions of the Meibomian glands, providing insights into their function and how they respond to treatment [4].
Treatment Options: Combining In-Office and At-Home Care
Lumen Optometric offers both in-office and at-home treatment plans for dry eye [5]. The clinic's approach emphasizes holistically based treatments derived from leading research [1].

iLux Meibomian Gland Treatment Device: The iLux device, an FDA-approved therapeutic treatment, uses advanced technology to directly target the Meibomian glands [4]. The treatment involves melting and gently releasing congested oil from the glands, promoting their healing and improving tear film stability.
At-Home Treatments: The in-office procedures are designed to enhance the effectiveness of at-home treatments, which may include artificial tears, warm compresses, and lid hygiene practices.
While the sources highlight the clinic's focus on holistic treatments, they also acknowledge that patients with very chronic dry eye may require additional medicated treatments [5]. The specific types of medicated treatments are not detailed in the sources.

Emphasis on Patient-Centered Care
The sources emphasize Lumen Optometric's commitment to providing an exceptional patient experience, combining the latest research and technology with personalized education and care [1]. The clinic encourages individuals experiencing dry eye to reach out for a consultation to discuss their symptoms and explore treatment options [6].

Does Myopia Get Worse with Age?
Understanding and Managing Myopia
The sources from Lumen Optometric's blog post primarily discuss myopia, or nearsightedness, and its implications, particularly for children. Myopia is a common vision condition where the eyeball elongates excessively, causing light to focus incorrectly and resulting in blurry vision when looking at distant objects [1, 2].

Factors Influencing Myopia Development
Genetics plays a significant role in myopia. If one or both parents have myopia, their children are at an increased risk of developing the condition [3]. However, environmental factors also contribute significantly to myopia development and progression [1, 2].

Increased near-work activities, such as prolonged reading, using computers and digital devices, and doing close-up work, have been linked to the rising prevalence of myopia [2]. These activities can strain the eye muscles and contribute to abnormal eye growth.
Reduced time spent outdoors, particularly during childhood, is another contributing factor [2]. Natural light and focusing on distant objects during outdoor play are thought to be beneficial for eye development and may help protect against myopia.
Recognizing Myopia in Children
Children may not always be able to express their vision difficulties, so parents and caregivers need to be observant. Some common signs of myopia in children include:

Squinting to see distant objects
Holding books or devices close to the face
Sitting very close to the television
Complaining of headaches or eye strain
Difficulty concentrating in school or completing assignments [2]
Consequences of Unmanaged Myopia
The sources emphasize that myopia is not simply an inconvenience that requires glasses; it poses risks to long-term eye health [2]. The excessive elongation of the eyeball associated with myopia is linked to a higher risk of developing serious eye conditions later in life, including:

Retinal detachment, where the retina detaches from the back of the eye
Glaucoma, a condition that damages the optic nerve
Cataracts, clouding of the eye's natural lens [2]
These conditions can lead to permanent vision loss and significantly impact an individual's quality of life.

Importance of Early Intervention
Early detection and treatment of myopia are crucial to slow its progression and reduce the risk of future complications [2, 4]. The sources highlight the importance of regular eye exams, particularly for children. Annual eye exams allow eye care professionals to monitor eye growth, detect any changes in vision, and recommend appropriate interventions.

While the sources mention Treehouse Eyes and their specific treatment approaches, it is important to consult with a qualified eye care professional to discuss the most appropriate management strategy for your individual needs. They can help determine the best course of action based on factors such as the severity of myopia, age, lifestyle, and overall eye health.

Myopia Symptoms and How To Treat
Signs, Risks, and Management of Myopia in Children
The sources, primarily from a blog post on the website of Lumen Optometric, focus on myopia, also known as nearsightedness, in children. Myopia occurs when the eyeball grows too long, causing blurred vision at a distance. The sources emphasize the importance of recognizing symptoms, understanding risk factors, and seeking early intervention to manage myopia and prevent potential complications. [1, 2]

Identifying Potential Myopia in Children
Parents should be vigilant in observing their children for signs of myopia. While children might not always be able to articulate their vision problems, certain behaviors can indicate potential nearsightedness. [3, 4]

Academic Challenges: Difficulty focusing in school or staying on task can stem from an inability to see clearly. [3]
Physical Symptoms: Squinting, headaches, holding books or devices close to the face, and sitting close to the television can all be indicators. [4]
Understanding the Role of Screen Time
The sources highlight the connection between increased screen time and the rising prevalence of myopia, particularly among children. [5] The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend due to school closures and increased reliance on virtual learning. [2, 5] Dr. Ryan Stybel, a Treehouse Eyes partner, explains that screen time or "near work" can cause myopia to develop earlier and progress more rapidly. [5]

The Importance of Outdoor Time
Spending time outdoors is presented as a crucial factor in mitigating the risks associated with excessive screen time. The sources suggest that natural sunlight and focusing on distant objects during outdoor activities can be beneficial for eye health and help prevent myopia from worsening. [2] Specifically, 90 minutes of outdoor time per day is recommended. [2]

Consequences of Unmanaged Myopia
The sources emphasize that myopia is not just about needing glasses; it can lead to more serious eye conditions later in life if left unmanaged. [4] These include:

Glaucoma
Macular Degeneration
Cataracts
These conditions can cause significant vision loss and impact quality of life. Dr. Denise Smith emphasizes that simply getting glasses corrects vision but doesn't address the underlying issue of eye growth. Specialized treatments are needed to slow or halt myopia progression and reduce the risk of these future complications. [4]

The Role of Annual Eye Exams
The sources stress the importance of annual eye exams, especially for children, as they might not be able to communicate their vision problems effectively. [2] Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing myopia and preventing its progression.

While the sources promote Treehouse Eyes as a specialized provider for myopia management, including treatments like prescription eye drops and customized contact lenses, it is essential to consult with a qualified eye care professional to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for your child's specific needs. [6]

Do Your Eyes Grow?
Eye Growth and Myopia Development
The sources explain that, like other parts of the body, eyes grow. Problems arise when the eyeball grows too long from front to back, a condition known as myopia or nearsightedness. [1, 2] This elongation causes light rays to focus incorrectly, resulting in blurred vision when looking at distant objects. [1]

Several factors contribute to myopia development, including genetics and environmental influences. [1] Research suggests that the increasing prevalence of myopia globally is linked to excessive near-work activities, such as using digital devices and doing homework, and reduced time spent outdoors, particularly during childhood. [1] These habits can strain the visual system and increase the risk of abnormal eye elongation. [1]

Myopia's implications extend beyond the need for vision correction. Excessive eye growth is associated with a higher risk of developing serious eye conditions later in life, including glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment, all of which can lead to vision loss. [3] Additionally, myopia can negatively impact quality of life, affecting performance in school, sports, and other activities that require clear distance vision, such as driving. [3]

Proactive Steps for Healthy Eye Development
While myopia cannot be reversed once it develops, it is possible to slow or even halt its progression. [4] The sources recommend several preventive measures to support healthy eye development and reduce the likelihood of myopia onset, especially in children:

Increased Outdoor Time: Spending more time outdoors, particularly during early childhood, is crucial. [4]
Limited Screen Time: Reducing the amount of time spent using screens and mobile devices, especially at a young age, is essential. [4]
Focus on Distant Objects: Engaging in activities that encourage focusing on distant objects, such as playing sports, can help. [4]
Regular Eye Exams: Routine eye exams are vital for monitoring vision and detecting any signs of abnormal eye growth. [3, 4]
Nutritious Diet: Consuming a healthy diet that includes nutrients beneficial for eye health is recommended. [4]
Understanding Family History: Being aware of genetic predispositions and family history of myopia can aid in early intervention. [4]
The sources underscore the importance of early intervention in managing myopia. [4] While Treehouse Eyes is mentioned as a specialized clinic offering personalized treatment plans, including prescription eye drops and customized contact lenses, this information is specific to that provider and might not represent all available treatment options. [2] Consulting with a qualified eye care professional is essential to determine the most appropriate course of action based on individual needs. [2]

Importance of Early Detection and Intervention
Early Detection and Intervention for Children's Vision Health
August is Children's Eye Health and Safety Month, a time to emphasize the importance of protecting and nurturing children's vision. Clear vision is fundamental for a child's overall development and well-being, impacting their ability to learn, play, and engage with the world around them [1]. However, many children may have undetected vision problems that can hinder their development if not addressed early [1].

The Importance of Early Detection
Early detection of vision issues is critical because it allows for timely intervention during crucial developmental stages [1]. When vision problems remain unaddressed, they can lead to a range of challenges, including:

Academic difficulties [1]
Behavioral problems [1]
Low self-esteem [1]
Addressing vision problems early can significantly improve a child's quality of life and prevent potential long-term consequences.

Recognizing the Signs
Parents and caregivers play a vital role in recognizing potential vision problems in children. Some common signs that a child may be struggling with their vision include:

Frequent squinting or eye rubbing [2]
Sitting too close to the TV or holding devices near their face [2]
Tilting their head to one side [2]
Covering one eye [2]
Difficulty seeing the board at school [2]
Avoiding reading or close work [2]
Losing their place while reading [2]
Trouble distinguishing colors [2]
Clumsiness or poor hand-eye coordination [2]
Headaches or eye pain after visual tasks [2]
If you notice any of these signs in your child, it's crucial to schedule an eye exam with an eye care professional specializing in pediatric patients. An eye exam can identify a variety of vision problems, such as:

Nearsightedness (myopia) [3]
Farsightedness (hyperopia) [3]
Lazy eye (amblyopia) [3]
Convergence insufficiency [3]
Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for the best possible outcomes.

Protecting Your Child's Vision
In addition to regular eye exams, there are proactive steps parents can take to safeguard their child's vision health [3]:

Ensure your child wears 100% UV-blocking sunglasses outdoors. This protects their eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays.
Limit screen time and encourage frequent breaks from 'near-work' activities. Extended near-work can strain the eyes.
Provide a nutritious diet rich in eye-healthy vitamins. A balanced diet supports overall eye health.
Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. Smoking can harm eye health.
The Value of Annual Eye Exams
Annual eye exams are a crucial part of preventive healthcare for children. During these comprehensive exams, eye care professionals assess various aspects of eye health, including:

Visual acuity (sharpness of vision) [4]
Eye alignment [4]
Overall eye health [4]
Annual exams allow for the early detection of refractive errors like myopia and other eye disorders that may not have obvious symptoms, such as glaucoma [4, 5]. Early intervention leads to better outcomes and focuses on treating the underlying issue rather than just correcting vision with glasses [5]. Regular eye exams are an investment in your child's long-term vision health.

Partnering with Eye Care Professionals
The sources emphasize the importance of partnering with eye care professionals who are experienced in treating children. They highlight Treehouse Eyes, a specialized clinic dedicated to managing and slowing myopia progression in children [5, 6]. Working closely with your child's eye doctor ensures they receive personalized care and the most appropriate treatment for their individual needs.

Childhood Myopia: What You Can Do
Myopia: Definition, Risks, and Management
Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a prevalent vision problem impacting individuals under 40, with a concerning increase in childhood cases [1]. Myopia occurs when the eye grows too long, causing blurry distance vision [1]. This elongation is precisely measured from the cornea to the retina, a distance called axial length [2].

Several risk factors contribute to myopia development:

Genetics: Children with one or both parents having myopia are more susceptible [2].
Limited Outdoor Time: Insufficient time spent outdoors is linked to higher myopia levels [2, 3]. Studies suggest that over 2 hours of daily outdoor activity can significantly reduce myopia risk, especially for children with myopic parents [3].
Excessive Near Work: Spending excessive time on activities like reading, schoolwork, and using digital screens elevates myopia risk [2].
Myopia in children is progressive, meaning it worsens until early adulthood, often requiring frequent prescription changes [4]. The implications of untreated childhood myopia extend beyond blurry vision, significantly increasing the risk of severe eye diseases later in life:

Myopic Maculopathy: This vision-threatening condition is 2 to 40 times more likely to develop in children with myopia, with the risk escalating as myopia progresses [5].
Retinal Detachment: A serious condition that can lead to blindness, retinal detachment is 3 to 21 times more likely in adults who had myopia as children [5].
Glaucoma: Myopia triples the risk of developing glaucoma, a major cause of blindness worldwide [5].
Early Cataract Development: While cataracts are age-related, myopia accelerates their onset, leading to earlier cataract surgery [6].
Beyond the physical risks, untreated myopia can negatively impact a child's academic, social, and emotional well-being:

Academic Performance: Studies have shown that correcting vision in students with myopia is more beneficial for their education than providing vitamins or medications for physical health [6].
Social and Emotional Well-being: Adolescents with myopia experience higher anxiety levels than their peers with normal vision [7]. Poor vision also affects self-esteem in children [7].
Managing Myopia

While genetics plays a role, lifestyle changes and myopia management treatment can significantly impact a child's eye health [7]:

Increased Outdoor Time: Encourage children to spend at least two hours daily outdoors [3].
Limited Near Work: Encourage breaks during extended periods of reading or screen time [8].
Myopia Management Treatment: Seeking professional treatment is crucial to effectively slow down myopia progression [8].
The sources highlight Treehouse Eyes, a specialized clinic offering state-of-the-art equipment, diagnostic technology, and the latest treatments for managing and slowing down myopia progression in children [8, 9]. They emphasize that myopia management empowers children to succeed academically, socially, and in various activities, ultimately improving their overall quality of life [9].

Orthokeratology (Ortho-K) Candidacy
Orthokeratology (Ortho-K) Candidacy at Lumen Optometric
Lumen Optometric offers Orthokeratology (Ortho-K) [1, 2], a non-surgical vision correction procedure that involves wearing specially designed contact lenses overnight to reshape the cornea [3-5]. The sources discuss candidacy requirements and potential benefits of Ortho-K for individuals with Myopia (nearsightedness) and Hyperopia (farsightedness) [1, 3-5].

Myopia
For individuals with myopia, Ortho-K can eliminate the need for glasses for distance vision. If you are myopic and require reading glasses due to presbyopia (age-related farsightedness), Ortho-K can also be customized to include a reading enhancement [3]. Astigmatism, which causes distorted vision and shadows [3], can also often be corrected with Ortho-K.

Hyperopia
The sources note that treating hyperopia with Ortho-K is more complex and categorize farsightedness into two types [4]:

Category 1: Individuals experience age-related reading difficulties starting in their 40s or 50s but generally have clear distance vision. Ortho-K can help reduce the need for reading glasses and may subtly improve distance vision [4].
Category 2: Individuals experience both near and distance vision problems starting in their 30s or 40s [5]. Ortho-K can potentially "reverse" their visual experience by about 20 years, restoring the clear vision they had in their younger years [5].
Candidacy Requirements
To determine Ortho-K candidacy, Lumen Optometric considers several factors, including:

Visual needs and expectations [1]
Eye health [1, 5]
Type and level of prescription [1]
Hours of sleep [1]
Willingness to participate in the treatment process [1]
There are no age restrictions for Ortho-K candidacy [1]. A consultation with a Lumen Optometric doctor is recommended to assess your individual needs and overall eye health to ensure you are a suitable candidate for Ortho-K [5].

Acrylic barriers are in place in areas where face-to-face communication is unavoidable [6]. Additionally, staff take daily inhaled doses of Iota-carrageenan, a polymer derived from red seaweed that has been shown to have antiviral activity against coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses [6].

Children and Adult Ortho-K Designs
Children and Adult Ortho-K Designs
Lumen Optometric uses Ortho-k, a treatment that brings clear vision, for both children and adults. However, there are key differences in the treatment approaches based on age [1].

Children
The primary goal of Ortho-k for children is to slow the progression of myopia to reduce the risk of eye disease in adulthood [1]. The secondary goal is to provide clear vision without the need for glasses or contacts [1]. To achieve these goals, children's Ortho-k designs use a smaller treatment zone to slow myopia and a looser fit to accommodate their developing eyes [2].

Adults
In contrast, the primary goal for adults is to achieve clear vision without glasses or contacts [2]. Secondary goals include eliminating dryness from contact lenses and modifying eyesight to better match visual needs [2]. Adult Ortho-k designs use a maximal treatment zone width to enhance vision and ensure long-lasting clarity [2].

This condition, characterized by red, dry, and itchy eyes, results from reduced blinking while focusing on screens, disrupting the tear film's natural lubrication process. The sources recommend incorporating regular breaks during screen use, allowing the eyes to rest and rehydrate.

Healthy Contact Lens Habits:

The sources highlight the importance of responsible contact lens usage. Contact lenses, a popular alternative to eyeglasses, require meticulous hygiene and adherence to eye care professional guidelines. Wearing contacts for extended periods, reusing old solution, and handling lenses with unwashed hands can increase the risk of eye infections and complications. The sources stress the importance of following prescribed wear schedules, using fresh lens solution daily, and maintaining impeccable hand hygiene when handling contact lenses.

Avoiding Eye Rubbing:

The sources caution against rubbing the eyes, even when they feel itchy. This seemingly harmless action can exacerbate irritation and potentially damage the delicate eye surface. Applying a cold compress can provide soothing relief for itchy eyes. If a foreign object sensation persists, gentle flushing with water is recommended. However, if the discomfort continues, seeking professional eye care is crucial to rule out any underlying issues.

Eye Protection Essentials:

The sources emphasize the importance of shielding the eyes from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, particularly the UV component, can contribute to eye damage and increase the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration. The sources recommend wearing UV-blocking sunglasses when outdoors to protect the eyes from these harmful rays. Additionally, protective eyewear is essential during activities that pose a risk of eye injury, such as swimming, cooking with oil, or engaging in home improvement projects involving chemicals.

Why You Should Protect Your Child From Myopia
Protecting Children from Myopia
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice, explain myopia and its increasing prevalence among children, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment to safeguard children's vision.

Understanding Myopia:

Myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness, is a vision condition where objects up close appear clear, while distant objects look blurry. This occurs when the eye grows too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This irregularity results in blurred vision for distant objects, impacting a child's ability to see the board at school or participate effectively in sports. [1]

The Role of Eye Exams:

The sources stress the critical role of regular eye exams in detecting myopia early. Eye doctors can accurately measure a child's vision and assess their overall eye health during these exams, diagnosing myopia and other potential vision problems. Early intervention is crucial in preventing vision issues from worsening. [2]

Treatment Options for Myopia:

Once myopia is diagnosed, various treatment options are available, including:

Contact Lenses: Worn during the day and removed at night, contact lenses help correct vision and provide clear distant vision. [2]
Orthokeratology: This non-surgical procedure involves specially designed contact lenses worn overnight to gradually reshape the curvature of the eye. This method not only corrects vision but also slows down the progression of myopia in children, offering a more long-term solution. [3]
The sources highlight Lumen Optometric's commitment to providing comprehensive eye care for children, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of myopia. They use advanced techniques like orthokeratology to ensure optimal results and protect children's vision for the future. [3]

Why Do Aging Eyes Need More Light?
The Effects of Aging on Vision and How to Adapt
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, explain why aging eyes require more light and offer tips for adjusting to age-related vision changes.

Age-Related Vision Changes:

As people age, their eyes undergo several changes that affect their vision. Around the age of 40, the lenses of the eyes begin to yellow and stiffen, reducing the amount of light that enters the eyes and impacting color perception and focus. [1] This stiffening of the lenses makes it harder to focus on near objects, a condition known as presbyopia. [1] The corneas also thicken and become less transparent, while the pupils shrink. [1] These changes further diminish the light reaching the eyes and make it more difficult to adapt to changes in lighting. [1] By age 65, individuals may require twice as much light as younger adults to see clearly. [2] They may also experience sensitivity to glare, slower adaptation between light and dark environments, and difficulty focusing on nearby objects. [1]

Adapting to Age-Related Vision Changes:

To address these changes, the sources suggest:

Regular Eye Exams: Regular visits to an eye doctor are crucial for everyone, regardless of age. [2] These exams can detect and treat eye conditions like macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma, which are more common in older adults and often lack early symptoms. [2]
Home Modifications: Increasing ambient light in living spaces can improve visibility and safety for older adults. [2] Installing dimmer switches allows individuals to adjust lighting levels based on their needs. [2] Task lighting in areas like kitchens and reading nooks can further enhance visibility. [2] Ensuring easy access to light switches is also essential for safety and convenience. [2]
The sources emphasize that individuals should not wait for vision changes to occur before seeking eye care. Lumen Optometric offers personalized eye care services, including eyeglasses, contact lenses, orthokeratology, and neurolens therapy, to help people maintain optimal vision throughout their lives. [3]

Why Children Should Have Their Eyes Tested Yearly
Yearly Eye Exams: A Window to Overall Health
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice, strongly advocate for annual eye exams for children, emphasizing their significance beyond just vision correction. The information highlights the crucial role of eyesight in education, the connection between eye health and overall well-being, and the benefits of early detection and intervention for potential eye problems.

Vision and Academic Success:

The sources underscore the critical link between good vision and a child's academic performance. They emphasize that a significant portion of learning in the early years relies heavily on visual input. Approximately 80% of learning during a child's first 12 years involves the use of their eyes [1]. Vision problems, if left unaddressed, can lead to difficulties in reading, writing, and even social interaction, hindering a child's ability to fully engage in the learning process [1].

Eye Exams as a Health Indicator:

Beyond vision assessment, the sources position eye exams as a valuable tool for gauging a child's overall health. Eye professionals can detect signs of underlying health conditions through a comprehensive eye examination. Vision problems, in some cases, can be an early indicator of systemic health issues like diabetes or high blood pressure [1]. Identifying these conditions early through an eye exam allows for timely intervention and management, potentially preventing complications and promoting better overall health outcomes [1].

Early Detection and Intervention:

The sources emphasize the importance of early detection and treatment for eye conditions. Similar to other health concerns, addressing eye issues in their early stages is crucial for effective management and positive outcomes [2]. Certain corrective measures, particularly for children, are most effective when implemented early, allowing for optimal vision development [2]. Early identification of eye problems helps mitigate potential complications and safeguards a child's vision from long-term adverse effects [2].

The Value of Comprehensive Eye Exams:

The sources advocate for yearly comprehensive eye exams conducted by a qualified optometrist, asserting that they go beyond basic vision screenings typically performed in schools [2]. While school screenings can help identify significant vision problems, they lack the depth and comprehensiveness of a professional eye exam [2]. Optometrists not only assess visual acuity using eye charts but also thoroughly examine the overall health of the eyes, ensuring that any abnormalities are detected and addressed before they escalate into more serious concerns [2].

Lumen Optometric, located in Sierra Madre, California, encourages parents to schedule yearly eye exams for their children to ensure their vision is at its best and to potentially detect underlying health conditions early [3, 4]. The practice offers a range of services, including comprehensive eye exams, contact lens fittings, and specialized treatments like orthokeratology and neurolens therapy [4].

Why Are Your New Eyeglasses Uncomfortable to Wear?
Possible Reasons for Eyeglass Discomfort
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, outline common reasons why new eyeglasses might cause discomfort. They also suggest potential solutions to address these issues and emphasize the importance of consulting a qualified eye care professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Eyeglass Fit and Structure:

Loose eyeglasses: If eyeglasses constantly slip or feel like they are falling off, they may be too loose around the ears. [1] A simple fix involves running the glasses under warm water and gently bending the temple arms downward for a tighter fit. Choosing smaller frames that better suit the wearer's face shape can also prevent slippage. [1]
Low nose bridge: Eyeglasses sliding down when tilting the head could indicate a low nose bridge. [1] Opting for rectangular or horn-rimmed glasses can provide better support. [1] Adjusting the nose pads inward can also enhance grip and prevent slippage. [1]
Incorrect nose pad setting: Eyeglasses leaving marks on the nose bridge might signify improperly set nose pads. [2] Simple adjustments to the nose pads can ensure they rest comfortably on the nose. [2] An optician can further adjust or replace them with alternative materials like silicone, acetate, or nylon for improved comfort. [2]
Heavy plastic frames: Plastic frames, especially if too heavy or with a narrow bridge, can contribute to discomfort. [2] Consider investing in frames with a wider bridge or opting for lighter-weight lenses to reduce pressure on the nose. [2]
Optical Considerations:

Incorrect pupillary distance (PD) measurement: Even with properly sized eyeglasses, headaches can arise from an incorrect PD measurement, which refers to the distance between the pupils. [3] Accurate PD measurement is crucial for comfortable eyeglass wear. [3] Mistakes in PD are common when ordering prescription glasses, highlighting the need for a precise measurement from a qualified eye care professional. [3]
The sources stress that working with a reliable eye care professional is essential to avoid discomfort when getting new glasses. Lumen Optometric offers a range of services, including eye exams, contact lens fittings, and treatments like neuro lens and corneal reshaping therapy, to address various vision care needs. They encourage scheduling an appointment for personalized eye care and achieving optimal visual comfort.

Why Are My Eyes So Dry?
Understanding and Treating Dry Eyes
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice, provide information about dry eyes, a prevalent condition, particularly in the digital age. The content explores the causes of dry eyes, various treatment options, and the importance of seeking professional care when necessary.

Causes of Dry Eyes:

Dry eyes occur when the eyes don't produce enough lubrication or the tears evaporate too quickly. Several factors contribute to this condition:

Aging: Tear production naturally decreases with age, making individuals over 50 more susceptible to dry eye symptoms. [1]
Hormonal Changes: Women are more prone to dry eyes due to hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy, menopause, or when using oral contraceptives. [1]
Environmental Conditions: Dry, windy, smoky, or dusty environments accelerate tear evaporation, leading to dry eyes. Similarly, prolonged computer use reduces blink rate, contributing to dryness. [1]
Medications: Certain medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants, blood pressure medications, and antidepressants, can decrease tear production. [2]
Health Conditions: Underlying health issues like Sjogren's syndrome, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid problems can also cause dry eyes. [2]
Treatment Options for Dry Eyes:

Treatment for dry eyes focuses on restoring or maintaining adequate tear volume to alleviate dryness and discomfort. Several approaches are available:

Artificial Tears: Over-the-counter eye drops that simulate natural tears can provide relief for mild dry eye cases. [2]
Lifestyle Changes: Simple adjustments like taking breaks during extended tasks, avoiding direct airflow towards the eyes, and using humidifiers to add moisture to the environment can help manage dry eye symptoms. [3]
Prescription Medications: In some cases, doctors may prescribe medications that stimulate tear production. [3]
Special Procedures: For severe cases, procedures like punctal plugs (closing tear ducts to minimize tear loss) or specialized contact lenses may be considered. [3]
Seeking Professional Care:

While home remedies and over-the-counter solutions can help manage mild dry eyes, it's crucial to seek professional medical attention if symptoms persist or worsen. Individuals should consult a doctor immediately if they experience:

Severe eye discomfort: Unbearable pain or irritation in the eyes warrants immediate medical evaluation. [4]

The sources advocate for proactive eye care, encouraging individuals experiencing persistent dry eye symptoms to seek professional help for effective diagnosis and management.

Who Is a Candidate for Specialty Contact Lenses?
Specialty Contact Lenses and Who They Benefit
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, discuss specialty contact lenses as an alternative to traditional contact lenses for individuals with unique eye conditions or those who find standard lenses uncomfortable. The information provided focuses on the various eye conditions that benefit from specialty lenses, the types of specialty lenses available, and the role of optometrists in determining the best course of treatment.

Eye Conditions That Benefit from Specialty Contact Lenses

Standard contact lenses do not cater to all eye conditions. For instance, keratoconus, a condition where the cornea thins and bulges into a cone-like shape, severely impacts vision. Specialty lenses, such as scleral lenses, are designed to vault over the cornea, creating a smooth optical surface for improved vision and comfort [1].

Similarly, astigmatism, characterized by an irregularly shaped cornea, can lead to blurred vision. While mild astigmatism might be corrected with standard lenses, severe cases may require toric lenses. These lenses are specifically designed to fit the unique shape of the eye, providing clear vision at all angles [1].

Dry eye syndrome, often exacerbated by conventional contact lenses, can also benefit from specialty lenses like scleral contacts. These lenses create a hydrating reservoir over the cornea, offering relief and retaining moisture [2].

Individuals who have undergone post-refractive surgery like LASIK or PRK may experience corneal changes that standard contact lenses cannot accommodate. Specialty lenses are designed to fit these altered corneal surfaces and provide the necessary vision correction [2].

Presbyopia, a condition associated with aging where the eye lens loses elasticity, making it difficult to focus on close objects, can also be addressed with specialty lenses. Multifocal and bifocal contact lenses provide clear vision at all distances, eliminating the need for reading glasses [3].

Furthermore, individuals with unusually large or small eyes often struggle to find a comfortable fit with standard lenses. Custom-fitted specialty lenses offer a solution by ensuring a proper fit and optimal vision correction [3].

The Role of Optometrists in Identifying Candidates

Lumen Optometric, the source publisher, emphasizes the role of optometrists in identifying candidates for specialty contact lenses. Optometrists conduct comprehensive eye exams, assessing each patient's lifestyle and preferences. This thorough evaluation enables them to recommend the most suitable treatment course, whether it be specialty lenses like scleral contacts or alternative treatments like neurolens therapy [4].

Lumen Optometric, located in Sierra Madre, California, encourages individuals seeking solutions for their unique eye care needs to schedule an appointment for a personalized assessment and treatment plan [5].

What's The Ideal Schedule For Pediatric Eye Exams?
The Importance of Pediatric Eye Exams
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, emphasize the significance of regular eye exams for children, known as pediatric eye exams. These exams play a crucial role in detecting vision problems early and ensuring children develop the necessary visual skills for academic success and overall well-being. The information provided highlights the recommended schedule for pediatric eye exams, factors influencing their frequency, and what to expect during these examinations.

Recommended Schedule for Pediatric Eye Exams:

The American Optometric Association (AOA) advises that children undergo their first comprehensive eye exam between the ages of 3 and 5. This initial assessment establishes a baseline for their eye health and identifies any potential vision concerns early on. Following this first exam, the AOA recommends annual eye checkups until the child reaches the age of 18, or 21 if they are still in school. [1]

Factors Influencing Exam Frequency:

While annual checkups are generally recommended, certain risk factors might necessitate more frequent eye exams for some children. These factors include:

Premature birth: Infants born prematurely are more susceptible to developing vision problems.
Family history of ocular diseases: A family history of conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, retinopathy, diabetes (type 1 and 2), strabismus (crossed eyes), and uncorrected refractive errors increases a child's risk of developing similar eye problems. [2]
Dry eye: Although often associated with aging, dry eye can also affect children and require specific treatment. [2]
In such cases, it's essential for parents to consult with an optometrist who can develop a personalized eye exam schedule based on the child's individual needs, risk factors, family history, and medical records. [2]

Components of a Pediatric Eye Exam:

A pediatric eye exam comprises various tests designed to assess a child's eye health and visual function. These tests often include:

Visual acuity test: Measures the child's ability to see clearly at different distances. [3]
Refraction test: Determines whether the child requires corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses) for optimal vision. [3]
Color blindness test: Screens for any deficiencies in the child's color vision. [3]
Slit lamp exam: Examines the surface of the eye for signs of infection or damage. [3]
Retinoscopy/autorefractor: Measures refractive errors such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. [4]
These tests provide a comprehensive evaluation of the child's eye health and help identify any underlying issues that may require treatment or further monitoring.

The Importance of Early Detection:

Early detection of vision problems through regular pediatric eye exams is critical for several reasons:

Timely Intervention: Identifying and addressing vision problems early allows for timely intervention and treatment, maximizing the chances of successful outcomes.
Preventing Academic Challenges: Undiagnosed vision problems can hinder a child's learning and academic performance. Early detection and correction ensure children can see clearly and participate fully in classroom activities.
Supporting Visual Development: Early childhood is a crucial period for visual development. Regular eye exams help monitor this development and ensure any issues are addressed promptly to support healthy vision.
Lumen Optometric encourages parents to prioritize their children's eye health by scheduling regular pediatric eye exams. They offer comprehensive eye care services tailored to children's needs, ensuring they receive the appropriate care and attention for optimal visual health.

What is Nearsightedness and How is it treated?
A Summary of Nearsightedness
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice, explain nearsightedness, also known as myopia. Nearsightedness occurs when the eyeball grows too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This results in blurred distance vision while near vision remains clear. [1, 2]

Nearsightedness affects a significant portion of the population, approximately 30% in the United States, and is particularly prevalent in children. [1, 2] Several factors contribute to the risk of developing nearsightedness: genetics, frequent near work, excessive screen time, reduced outdoor time, urbanization, and ethnicity. [2] Individuals of Asian descent, in particular, have a higher prevalence of nearsightedness. [2]

Symptoms of nearsightedness include blurred distance vision, difficulty seeing distant objects like road signs or whiteboards, squinting or leaning forward to see details, headaches from eye strain, eye fatigue after close work, and poor night vision. [3] Typically, both eyes are affected, though the degree of nearsightedness may differ between the two eyes. [4]

If left untreated, nearsightedness can lead to several issues including a greater dependence on corrective measures like glasses or contact lenses, fatigue and discomfort from constant squinting, difficulty with schoolwork or other activities that require clear distance vision, and social implications due to challenges with extracurricular activities or career options that have vision requirements. [4, 5]

More seriously, untreated nearsightedness can increase the risk of severe eye conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment. [5] Although the severity of nearsightedness typically stabilizes by adulthood, early treatment can offer significant benefits for eye health, visual development, and quality of life. [5]

While nearsightedness cannot be cured, there are effective treatment options for slowing or stopping its progression, such as overnight contact lenses, daytime soft contact lenses, and prescription eye drops. [6] The most suitable option depends on factors such as the severity of nearsightedness, lifestyle needs, age, and overall eye health. [6]

The sources emphasize the importance of routine eye exams for early detection and treatment of nearsightedness, especially for children and teens showing signs of vision issues, individuals with a family history of high myopia, and those with existing myopia who require close monitoring. [7]

What You Should Know About Trigeminal Dysphoria
Trigeminal Dysphoria and Neurolenses
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care provider, discuss trigeminal dysphoria, a condition linked to prolonged digital device use, particularly in individuals with eye misalignment. They highlight the symptoms, diagnosis, and a potential treatment option called Neurolens.

What is Trigeminal Dysphoria?

Trigeminal dysphoria primarily affects individuals with ocular misalignment, a condition where the eyes do not properly align when focusing on nearby objects. This misalignment forces the visual system to overwork, straining the trigeminal nerve, the largest nerve connected to the brain [1]. This strain on the trigeminal nerve results in various symptoms, including headaches, eye strain, sensitivity to light, and neck and shoulder pain [1]. The condition is exacerbated by the constant use of digital devices, which demands continuous near vision [1].

Diagnosis and Treatment with Neurolens

Diagnosing trigeminal dysphoria requires a comprehensive eye exam by a qualified eye care professional. While the symptoms might overlap with other eye conditions, an eye exam can accurately determine the root cause [2]. Lumen Optometric, the source publisher, offers Neurolens as a potential treatment for trigeminal dysphoria [2].

Neurolens technology utilizes customized lenses to correct the specific ocular misalignment of an individual, reducing strain on the visual system [3]. This correction aims to alleviate the symptoms associated with trigeminal dysphoria and enhance visual comfort [3]. Lumen Optometric uses advanced equipment called SightSync to measure eye misalignment and ensure the Neurolenses are tailored to the individual's needs [3].

Expected Outcomes with Neurolens

While most individuals experience vision improvement within a week of using Neurolens, those with chronic conditions might require up to six weeks to notice a difference [3]. Lumen Optometric, located in Sierra Madre, CA, is the sole provider of Neurolens treatment in the San Gabriel Valley [3]. They encourage individuals experiencing symptoms of trigeminal dysphoria to schedule a consultation for diagnosis and potential treatment [4].

What To Know About Myopia Control In Children
Myopia Control in Children
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, discuss myopia, also known as nearsightedness, and its impact on children's eye health. The information focuses on the significance of myopia control in slowing down the progression of this condition and reducing the risks associated with high myopia.

Understanding Myopia and Its Progression:

Myopia is a refractive error in which the eye grows too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This results in blurred distance vision. In children, myopia often progresses rapidly, with vision worsening every few months. This ongoing deterioration, termed myopia progression, typically continues until adolescence or even early adulthood. [1]

Importance of Myopia Control:

Myopia control aims to slow down the progression of myopia using various treatment methods. This is particularly crucial for children as rapid myopia progression increases their risk of developing serious eye conditions later in life. These conditions include: [1-3]

Glaucoma: A condition that damages the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain.
Retinal detachments: The separation of the retina from the back of the eye, potentially leading to vision loss.
Myopic maculopathy: Damage to the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision.
Benefits of Myopia Control:

Besides reducing the risks of future eye diseases, myopia control offers several advantages: [3, 4]

Improved quality of life: Children with controlled myopia experience better vision and reduced eye strain. They are less reliant on glasses or contact lenses, particularly in the morning before putting on their corrective eyewear.
Increased candidacy for laser eye surgery: Lower levels of myopia make individuals more suitable candidates for laser eye surgery as adults.
Better visual outcomes after surgery: Individuals with lower myopia tend to have better visual results following laser eye surgery.
Myopia Control Methods:

Several treatment options are available for myopia control: [2, 5]

Atropine eye drops: These drops help slow down eye growth, thus reducing myopia progression.
Soft contact lenses: Special types of soft contact lenses designed for myopia control are available.
Ortho-k: This involves wearing specially designed gas permeable contact lenses overnight to reshape the cornea.
Special types of glasses: Certain types of glasses can help control myopia.
Role of Environmental Factors:

The sources acknowledge the influence of environmental factors on myopia development and progression. They recommend: [4]

Increased outdoor time: Spending more time outdoors, ideally two to three hours daily, can delay or prevent myopia onset.
Limited screen time and near work: Reducing the time spent on digital devices and engaging in close-up activities can minimize the risk of myopia progression.

Early detection and treatment are crucial for preserving vision and preventing potential complications.

The sources suggest that Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of eye care services, including comprehensive eye exams, contact lens fittings, orthokeratology, neurolens therapy, and scleral lenses for conditions like keratoconus.

What Causes Myopia?
The Causes and Management of Myopia
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, focus on myopia, also known as nearsightedness, and emphasize its increasing prevalence among children, attributing it to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Genetics plays a significant role in myopia development, as children with one or both parents having myopia are at a higher risk of developing it. [1] However, environmental factors, specifically excessive near work and insufficient outdoor time, are also major contributors. [1-3] Children spending more than three hours daily engaged in activities like reading, using smartphones, or working on computers are more susceptible to developing myopia. [2] Conversely, spending at least two to three hours outdoors daily has been shown to delay or prevent myopia onset. [3]

The sources describe myopia as an eye disease characterized by the elongation of the eye, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on its surface. [4] This results in blurred distance vision, headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. [1] The eye's elongation typically ceases when overall body growth stops in early adulthood. [4] However, children may experience periods of rapid eye growth, mirroring overall growth spurts, leading to a sudden need for stronger eyeglass prescriptions. [4]

The sources underscore the importance of myopia management, as childhood myopia significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life, such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration. [5] Early intervention is crucial for mitigating these risks. Treehouse Eyes, a specialized myopia treatment center, offers various treatment options to slow myopia progression, including custom contact lenses and prescription eye drops. [5, 6] Their doctors consider a child's medical history, genetics, and lifestyle to develop personalized treatment plans. [5, 6]

The sources highlight the positive impact of myopia treatment on children's lives, citing improved vision, reduced eye strain and headaches, better academic performance, and an enhanced overall quality of life. [5, 6] They encourage parents to schedule consultations with eye care professionals, especially if they notice signs of myopia in their children, such as squinting, difficulty seeing distant objects, or frequent headaches.

What Can Make Contact Lens Fitting Harder?
Difficulties in Contact Lens Fitting
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, explain the challenges associated with fitting contact lenses for individuals with certain eye conditions.

Dry eye disease can make contact lens wear uncomfortable. The condition is characterized by insufficient lubrication and moisture on the eye's surface, making it more susceptible to inflammation. Wearing contact lenses can worsen dry eye symptoms by increasing friction between the lenses and the eyes [1].

Keratoconus also poses difficulties in contact lens fitting [1]. This progressive disease causes the cornea, the transparent front part of the eye responsible for focusing light, to thin and bulge outward, taking on a cone shape. This irregular shape distorts vision and makes it challenging to fit contact lenses properly [1].

Despite these challenges, individuals with dry eyes and keratoconus can still wear contact lenses. Scleral lenses, larger than traditional gas permeable lenses, are recommended in these cases [2]. Due to their size, scleral lenses vault over the entire corneal surface, resting on the sclera (the white part of the eye) [2]. This positioning avoids contact with the sensitive cornea, making them more comfortable for people with keratoconus [2].

The sources emphasize the expertise of Lumen Optometric in fitting scleral lenses. Dr. Eric To, the proprietor, is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society, indicating advanced training in this area [2].

For Brides and Grooms Who Wear Glasses
Recommendations for Brides and Grooms Who Wear Glasses
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, offer advice for brides and grooms who wear glasses and want to look their best on their wedding day.

Embrace Glasses as a Statement Piece:

The sources encourage couples to view their glasses as an opportunity to enhance their wedding day look. They suggest choosing stylish frames that complement the wedding attire, treating them like a piece of jewelry that adds a personal touch to the overall ensemble. [1]

Schedule a Custom Fitting with Your Partner:

To find the perfect pair of glasses, the sources recommend scheduling a custom fitting with your partner. This allows both individuals to try on different styles and receive guidance from an eye care professional. The eye doctor can consider factors like face shape and personal preferences to help select frames that flatter each person's features. Ensuring a perfect fit is crucial for comfort throughout the wedding day, from the ceremony to the reception. [1]

Update Your Prescription and Consider Anti-Reflective Lenses:

The sources emphasize the importance of having an up-to-date eyeglass prescription, as vision can change over time. They recommend scheduling an eye exam before the wedding to ensure optimal vision correction. Additionally, they suggest opting for lenses with anti-reflective coating to minimize glare in photographs. This feature is particularly beneficial for wedding events, where numerous photos will be taken. [2]

Lumen Optometric's Services:

The sources highlight Lumen Optometric's commitment to providing exceptional eye care services, including those specifically tailored for weddings. They encourage couples to schedule an appointment for a custom fitting and other eye care needs. [3, 4]

What Are Toric Lenses For?
Understanding Toric Contact Lenses
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, provide information about toric contact lenses and their use in correcting astigmatism.

Astigmatism is a common eye condition affecting about one in three people. [1] It occurs when the cornea, the eye's outer layer, is shaped more like a football than a perfectly round ball. This irregular shape prevents light from focusing properly on the retina, resulting in blurred vision. [1]

Toric contact lenses are specifically designed to correct astigmatism. [1, 2] Unlike regular contact lenses, which are spherical, toric lenses have a unique shape resembling the side of a donut. [2] This shape allows them to have different refractive powers in different directions, effectively compensating for the irregular curvature of the cornea. [2]

Key Features of Toric Lenses:

Donut-like shape: This distinctive shape, unlike the spherical shape of regular lenses, provides varying refractive powers to correct astigmatism. [2]
Weighted edges: Toric lenses have a small weight at their edges to ensure they remain properly aligned on the eye after each blink. [2] Blinking naturally causes the contact lenses to rotate, and the weighted edges help them return to the correct position for clear vision. [2]
Types of Toric Lenses:

Toric lenses are available in two main types: soft and hard. [3]

Soft toric lenses: These are comfortable to wear but may be more prone to slipping out of place. [3]
Hard toric lenses (rigid gas permeable): These lenses tend to stay in place better and offer superior vision correction, but they require a longer adjustment period. [3]
The sources emphasize the importance of a proper fit for toric lenses. [3] Ill-fitting lenses can easily slip, negating their ability to improve vision clarity. [3]

Beyond toric lenses, the sources mention neurolens treatment as another option for addressing vision conditions. [3] However, they do not provide further details about this treatment. If you are interested in learning more about neurolens treatment or other options for astigmatism, the sources recommend consulting an eye doctor. [3]

What Are Myopia Treatment Benefits?
Benefits of Myopia Treatment
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, highlight the numerous benefits of treating myopia, also known as nearsightedness, early on. Myopia is a common vision issue among children, affecting 1 in 3 children [1].

Short-Term Benefits [2-4]

This can lead to a lack of confidence and impact academic engagement. Treating myopia can help children see better, improving their academic performance and boosting their self-assurance.
Reduced eye strain: Children with myopia often experience headaches and other discomforts due to the constant effort of focusing on distant objects. Myopia treatment can alleviate these symptoms, improving their overall comfort.
Increased quality of life: Early myopia treatment can enhance a child's confidence and enable them to participate in various activities without limitations. This can lead to improved mental health and overall happiness, as some studies have shown a correlation between myopia and mental health issues.
Long-Term Benefits [5, 6]

Reduced risk of serious eye diseases: High myopia can increase the risk of developing serious eye conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachments, macular degeneration, and cataracts. Early intervention for myopia significantly reduces these risks.
Expanded career prospects: Certain professions, such as those in the military, aviation, surgery, and emergency response, require good vision. By slowing down the progression of myopia, children can broaden their career options and pursue their aspirations without being limited by their vision.
Lower healthcare costs: Treating myopia early can potentially save on future healthcare expenses. Managing myopia early can prevent the development of more serious eye diseases, which can be costly to treat.
Enhanced overall quality of life: Myopia can make daily activities like driving, playing sports, and reading challenging. Early intervention can improve overall vision, making everyday tasks easier and more enjoyable.
Treehouse Eyes [7] offers customized contact lenses, specialized prescription eye drops, and personalized treatment plans for children with myopia. Their doctors can determine the most suitable treatment plan during the initial consultation.

Watery Eyes: Causes and When to See a Doctor
Understanding Watery Eyes
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, explain the causes of watery eyes and when it's necessary to seek professional eye care.

Tears play a vital role in maintaining eye health. They lubricate the eyes, wash away foreign particles, and help prevent infection. Tears contain water and salt, providing moisture with each blink [1].

Watery eyes occur when the tear ducts become overwhelmed by an excess of tears produced by the glands under the eyelids [2]. This often resolves naturally, but if it's a recurring issue, it's recommended to avoid contact lenses and consult an eye doctor [2].

Common Causes of Watery Eyes:

Emotional responses: Tears are a natural response to emotions like sadness, joy, or pain.
Physical reactions: Laughing, vomiting, coughing, yawning, and experiencing strong tastes can also trigger excess tear production [2].
Dry eye syndrome: Paradoxically, excessively dry eyes can lead to watery eyes. When tears lack the proper balance of water, salt, and oils, the eyes become irritated and overproduce tears, leading to overflow [2].
When to Seek Professional Help:

While most cases of watery eyes clear up without treatment, persistent watery eyes warrant a visit to an eye doctor to determine the underlying cause [3].

Symptoms that may indicate a need for professional attention include:

Recurring watery eyes [2, 3]
Injured or scratched eye [3]
Swollen or red eyes [3]
Tenderness around the nose or sinuses [3]
Severe headache associated with watery eyes [3]
An eye exam can help identify the cause of your watery eyes and determine the most appropriate treatment.

Differences: Visual Migraine VS Ocular Migraine
Differences Between Visual and Ocular Migraines
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, explain the differences between visual and ocular migraines.

Visual migraines are a common type of migraine that causes temporary vision disturbances in both eyes. [1] Most visual migraines last around 30 minutes but can vary depending on individual stress levels and overall health. [1] Visual migraines may be followed by a headache. [1]

Symptoms of a visual migraine include: [2]

A flickering blind spot in or near the center of your peripheral vision
Wavy or zigzag patterns of colored light surrounding a blind spot
A blind spot that slowly moves across your field of vision
Ocular migraines, on the other hand, are a rarer type of migraine that affects only one eye. [2] Unlike visual migraines, ocular migraines cause temporary vision loss in the affected eye due to reduced blood flow or blood vessel spasms in the retina. [2] Ocular migraines typically last for about an hour, after which vision returns to normal. [2]

The most common symptom of an ocular migraine is the appearance of a blind spot that starts in the center of the vision and grows larger, eventually blocking the entire field of vision. [3] A migraine headache may occur before, during, or after an ocular migraine. [3]

The sources note that both visual and ocular migraines usually resolve on their own within an hour or less and are generally not cause for concern. [3] However, if these migraines persist, it is recommended to consult an eye doctor. [3]

Links Between Vision and Headaches
Understanding Headaches Related to Vision
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, discuss the connection between vision problems and headaches. Certain types of headaches, like migraines and cluster headaches, can directly impact vision. Migraines, characterized by intense pain in and around the eyes, are often preceded by an aura that manifests as flashing lights, a prismatic rainbow of lights, or a zigzag pattern of shimmering lights [1]. Cluster headaches, occurring in groups, cause pain around the eyes that radiates down the neck and shoulders, accompanied by symptoms like red eyes, pupil size changes, eyelid droop, and nasal drainage [1].

Conversely, some vision problems can also trigger headaches. These headaches often arise from eye strain, particularly when the eyes are overworked, and focusing becomes difficult [2]. The sources list several vision problems that can lead to headaches:

Eye Strain: Common among individuals who spend prolonged periods in front of digital screens, eye strain results from overuse of the eye's focusing muscles, leading to headaches around or behind the eyes [2].
Farsightedness: This condition makes it challenging to focus on nearby objects, increasing the likelihood of eye strain and frontal headaches or brow aches [2].
Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma (AACG): This rare type of glaucoma causes a rapid rise in eye pressure, resulting in symptoms like eye pain, redness, cloudy vision, and headaches [2].
The sources emphasize the importance of consulting an eye doctor if you experience any of these symptoms, as they could indicate an underlying vision problem that requires attention.

Vision Changes 101: Essentials You Need to Know
Vision Changes and Their Causes
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, offer a comprehensive overview of vision changes, their causes, symptoms, and the importance of seeking professional eye care.

Vision changes refer to any alterations in your ability to see properly. [1] These changes can range from mild blurriness to significant vision loss and can stem from various factors, including problems within the eyes themselves or underlying health conditions affecting the entire body. [2]

The sources highlight refractive errors as the most common cause of vision changes. [2] Refractive errors occur when the eye's shape prevents light from focusing directly on the retina, resulting in blurred vision. Common refractive errors include:

Myopia (nearsightedness): Difficulty seeing distant objects clearly.
Presbyopia (age-related farsightedness): Difficulty focusing on near objects.
Beyond refractive errors, the sources list several other conditions that can lead to vision changes: [2, 3]

Age-related macular degeneration: A leading cause of vision loss in people over 50, affecting the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, straight-ahead vision.
Cataracts: Clouding of the natural lens of the eye, causing blurred vision, faded colors, and increased sensitivity to light.
Dry eyes: Insufficient lubrication of the eyes, leading to irritation, discomfort, and blurred vision.
Retinal detachment: Separation of the retina from the back of the eye, potentially causing permanent vision loss if not treated promptly.
Eye infections: Conditions like pink eye (conjunctivitis) and styes can cause redness, irritation, and discharge from the eyes.
Eye injuries: Trauma to the eye from accidents or other causes can lead to various vision problems.
The sources emphasize the importance of recognizing the symptoms of vision changes, as early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing potential vision loss. [3] Symptoms to watch out for include: [4]

Eye pain
Redness of the eyes
Blurred vision
Increased sensitivity to light
Double vision
Discharge from the eyes
Itchiness and other irritation
Droopy eyelid
Decreased vision in dimly lit settings
Inflammation
If you experience any of these symptoms, the sources strongly recommend scheduling a comprehensive eye exam with a qualified eye care professional. [4] These exams not only assess your vision but also provide insights into your overall health. [4]

VR Headsets: Are They Bad for the Eyes?
The Effects of VR Headsets on Your Eyes
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, explore the potential effects of virtual reality (VR) headsets on eye health. While VR technology offers immersive experiences for gaming, entertainment, work, and education, it's essential to be aware of the possible impact on your eyes.

VR headsets, similar to other digital screens like TVs and smartphones, can contribute to eye strain, fatigue, discomfort, and blurred vision. This is partly because people tend to blink less when using digital screens [1]. Blinking is crucial for maintaining eye moisture and removing debris. A reduced blink rate can lead to dry eyes [1].

Additionally, the brain works harder to reconcile the differences between the virtual depth presented in the VR headset and the actual perceived depth, further contributing to eye strain [1].

Another concern associated with VR headsets is visually-induced motion sickness, often referred to as "cybersickness." This can cause symptoms like headaches, lightheadedness, difficulty focusing, sweating, and nausea that may persist even after using the headset [2]. Individuals susceptible to motion sickness or those with existing depth perception issues are more prone to experiencing cybersickness [2].

Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate the potential negative effects of using VR headsets. The sources recommend following the "20/20/20 Rule," which involves taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away [3]. This helps to reduce eye strain. Keeping your eyes lubricated with artificial tears can also alleviate dryness [3]. Limiting VR headset usage, especially late at night, is advised to prevent eye strain and minimize exposure to blue light, which can interfere with sleep patterns [3].

The sources emphasize the importance of regular eye exams for overall eye health, especially for frequent VR users [4]. Regular checkups can help identify and address any potential eye problems early on.

Understanding How Prescription Lenses Are Made
Understanding Prescription Lenses
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, offer insights into prescription lenses, their manufacturing process, and various types available to address different vision needs.

Purpose of Prescription Lenses: Prescription lenses are designed to correct refractive errors, which are vision problems that occur when the eye fails to properly focus light on the retina. These errors include:

Myopia (nearsightedness): Difficulty seeing distant objects clearly.
Hyperopia (farsightedness): Difficulty seeing nearby objects clearly.
Astigmatism: Blurred vision at all distances due to an unevenly shaped cornea.
Presbyopia: Age-related difficulty focusing on near objects, often requiring reading glasses.
Crafting Prescription Lenses: The process of creating prescription lenses begins with a comprehensive eye exam conducted by an optometrist. This exam determines the individual's unique prescription, which includes measurements for sphere power, cylinder power, axis, and reading prescription if needed.

After the eye exam, the prescription is sent to a specialized laboratory where the lenses are crafted:

Lens Cutting: A machine cuts the lens blanks according to the prescribed measurements and the chosen frame style.
Lens Finishing: The lenses undergo additional treatments to enhance their functionality and durability. These treatments may include:
Anti-reflective coatings to reduce glare and improve clarity.
Scratch-resistant coatings to protect the lenses from damage.
Color tints for aesthetic purposes or to enhance contrast.
UV protection to shield the eyes from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Types of Prescription Lenses: The sources describe several common types of prescription lenses:

Single-vision lenses: Provide a single prescription power throughout the entire lens, correcting nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism.
Bifocal lenses: Combine two prescription powers in one lens, with the upper portion for distance vision and the lower portion for near vision, commonly prescribed for individuals with presbyopia.
Specialty lenses: Cater to specific needs, such as sports goggles for eye protection during physical activities and lenses designed for individuals with low vision.
The sources emphasize the importance of consulting with an eye care professional to determine the most suitable type of prescription lenses based on individual vision requirements and lifestyle.

Types of People Who Need UV Eye Protection
The Importance of UV Eye Protection
The sources, published by Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, stress the significance of protecting your eyes from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Overexposure to UV light can lead to various eye problems, ranging from short-term issues like photokeratitis (sunburn of the eye) to long-term conditions like cataracts and retinal damage. [1]

The sources highlight several groups who are particularly vulnerable to UV damage and require extra protection:

Construction Workers and Outdoor Enthusiasts: Individuals who spend significant time outdoors, such as construction workers, cyclists, hikers, boaters, and beachgoers, are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation. Construction workers may receive 10-20% more UV exposure than indoor workers. [2] Surfaces like dry sand and sea foam can reflect UV light, further increasing exposure for those engaging in water activities. [2]
Children: Children tend to spend more time outdoors than adults, making them susceptible to cumulative UV damage. Protecting their eyes from a young age is crucial to prevent long-term eye problems later in life. [2]
Contact Lens Wearers: While some contact lenses offer UV protection, they do not cover the entire eye area. The skin of the eyelids and brow bone remains vulnerable and needs additional protection from sunglasses. [2]
Health-Conscious Individuals: Protecting your eyes from UV radiation is an essential aspect of overall health and well-being, particularly for individuals with a family history of age-related macular degeneration. [2]
The sources emphasize that safeguarding your eyes from UV radiation should be a priority, alongside maintaining a healthy diet and exercising regularly. [2]

Types of Cataracts and How They Are Diagnosed
Cataract Overview
The sources from Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, provide information about different types of cataracts, how they are diagnosed, and treatment options.

Cataracts are characterized by cloudiness or blurring of the natural lens of the eye, which is normally clear. [1] This condition can lead to various vision problems, including:

Cloudy or blurred vision [1]
Increased sensitivity to light [1]
Poor night vision [1]
Faded color perception [1]
While cataracts are commonly associated with aging, they can affect individuals of all ages. [2] The sources outline several types of cataracts:

Age-related cataracts: These develop gradually as part of the natural aging process. Lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, steroid use, and diabetes can increase the risk of developing this type of cataract. [2] A family history of cataracts and previous eye surgeries can also contribute to the likelihood of developing age-related cataracts. [2]
Congenital cataracts: Some individuals are born with cataracts or develop them during infancy. [3] Although relatively uncommon in children, congenital cataracts that significantly affect vision require prompt treatment to prevent complications like amblyopia, commonly known as lazy eye. [3]
Traumatic cataracts: Eye injuries, both blunt and penetrating, can lead to traumatic cataracts. [3] These cataracts may develop immediately after the injury or years later. [3]
Secondary cataracts: Following cataract surgery, scar tissue can form on the eye, causing vision to become cloudy again. [3] This type of cataract, known as secondary cataract, is relatively common, affecting approximately two out of five individuals who undergo cataract surgery. [3] A non-invasive procedure called YAG laser capsulotomy is typically used to treat secondary cataracts, with patients usually regaining normal vision within a few days. [3]
Early detection of cataracts is crucial for effective management. The sources recommend regular comprehensive eye exams, particularly for individuals over 60, to identify potential eye conditions. [4] During these exams, an eye care provider will use dilating eye drops to widen the pupil and check for signs of cataracts and other eye problems. [4] Additional tests, such as refraction tests, ophthalmoscopy, and slit lamp exams, may be performed to assess vision and eye health. [4]

Treatment for cataracts depends on the severity of the condition and its impact on daily life. In the early stages, prescription glasses, contact lenses, brighter lighting, and anti-glare sunglasses may suffice to improve vision. [5] However, if cataracts begin to interfere with daily activities, surgery is often recommended. [5]

The sources emphasize the importance of proactive eye care, encouraging individuals to schedule eye exams even before experiencing noticeable vision changes. [5]

Top Myopia Treatment Options For Children
Managing Myopia in Children
The sources from Lumen Optometric, a vision care practice in California, provide an overview of myopia, also known as nearsightedness, and treatment options for children. Myopia occurs when the eyeball grows too quickly or the cornea curves too sharply, causing light rays to focus in front of the retina instead of on it. This results in blurry vision for distant objects, while nearby objects appear clear. [1]

While myopia cannot be cured or reversed, it can be managed to improve vision and prevent further deterioration. [1] Early intervention is essential, as myopia typically develops between the ages of 6 and 12. [2] If left untreated, myopia can lead to more serious eye conditions later in life. [1]

The sources highlight several treatment options:

Specialized contact lenses: These include multifocal lenses designed to slow eye growth and orthokeratology (Ortho-K) lenses, which reshape the cornea overnight for clearer vision throughout the day. [3]
Low-dose atropine eye drops: These drops have shown promise in managing myopia progression. [3]
Increased outdoor time: Encouraging children to spend more time outdoors, balancing it with screen time, can help counteract myopia development and progression. [4]
The sources emphasize that consulting with a qualified optometrist is crucial to determine the most appropriate treatment for each child. [4, 5] They recommend seeking an optometrist with expertise in myopia management for personalized recommendations. [4]

Progressive lenses offer a seamless transition between different prescriptions for seeing at various distances, eliminating the need for separate pairs of glasses. [1]

Benefits of Progressive Lenses:

Improved Vision at All Distances: Progressive lenses allow wearers to see clearly at varying distances without having to switch glasses, providing a smooth transition between near, intermediate, and far vision. [2]
Enhanced Comfort: Unlike traditional bifocals or trifocals with visible lines separating the different prescriptions, progressive lenses have no visible lines, making them more comfortable for extended wear. [2]
Natural Visual Experience: The gradual change in prescription mimics how the eyes naturally adjust focus, offering a more natural visual experience compared to the abrupt shifts encountered with bifocals or reading glasses. [3]
Aesthetic Appeal: The absence of visible lines enhances the appearance of the lenses, making them a preferred choice for those who find traditional bifocals or reading glasses less appealing. [3]
Drawbacks of Progressive Lenses:

Higher Cost: The advanced technology involved in manufacturing progressive lenses makes them more expensive than traditional bifocals or reading glasses, which could be a barrier for some individuals. [4]
Adaptation Period: Adjusting to progressive lenses takes time, and some people may experience initial discomfort or disorientation as their eyes adapt to the new prescription. [4]
Reduced Peripheral Vision: The narrow corridor of clear vision in progressive lenses can lead to reduced peripheral vision, potentially posing safety concerns when driving or navigating unfamiliar surroundings. [4]
Increased Glare and Reflections: Progressive lenses may be more prone to glare and reflections, particularly in bright light conditions. [5]
Adapting to Progressive Lenses:

The sources recommend allowing a few days for your eyes to adjust to the new prescription. [5] Practicing focusing on objects at different distances can help you adapt to switching between near and far vision. Patience is also crucial during the adaptation period. [5]

To determine if progressive lenses are right for you, the sources advise consulting with an eye care professional like those at Lumen Optometric. [6] However, it's essential to note that this specific recommendation is for their practice in California and might not apply to your location.

However, it's crucial to be aware of the potential drawbacks and adaptation period associated with these lenses. A thorough consultation with an eye care professional can help you make an informed decision about whether progressive lenses are the right choice for you.

The Manufacturing Process of Contact Lenses
How Contact Lenses Are Made
The sources describe the intricate manufacturing process of contact lenses, highlighting the differences between soft and rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lenses. The process involves material selection, molding, shaping, finishing, quality control, and packaging.

Material Selection: The base material for soft contact lenses is typically hydrogel or silicone hydrogel, chosen for their oxygen permeability and biocompatibility [1]. These materials allow the eyes to breathe, crucial for healthy wear. RGP lenses prioritize oxygen permeability even further, using durable and breathable plastics like fluoropolymers combined with silicone [1].

Molding: Soft contact lenses are shaped through spin-casting or lathe-cutting [2].

Spin-casting: Involves depositing liquid plastic into molds that are then spun until the plastic takes the desired shape [2].
Lathe-cutting: Uses computer-controlled tools to carve the plastic into lens form from a disc of material [2].
RGP lenses are shaped primarily through lathe-cutting, offering greater precision for intricate designs [3]. This method allows for complex curves and features to address specific vision needs, like astigmatism [3].

Shaping and Finishing Touches: Both soft and RGP lenses undergo additional processes to ensure comfort and clarity [4]. These include:

Polishing: Achieves a smooth surface for comfortable wear [4].
Hydration (Soft Lenses Only): Soft lenses are bathed in a sterile solution to absorb water and become flexible [4].
Quality Control and Packaging: Every lens undergoes rigorous inspection for defects [5]. The lenses are then packaged in sterile blisters filled with saline solution to keep them hydrated and ready for use [5].

Advanced Contact Lenses: Advancements in eye care have led to customized contact lenses for specific conditions, such as irregularly shaped corneas [5]. New materials have also enabled extended wear options for both soft and RGP lenses [6].

Is Myopia Hereditary?
Myopia and its Hereditary Nature
The sources explain that myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness, is a prevalent vision condition that results from an elongated eyeball. This elongation causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it, leading to blurry distance vision. Myopia often begins in childhood and tends to worsen as the child grows. [1]

The sources present compelling evidence from extensive research, including twin and family studies, and genetic mapping, that genetics significantly influence myopia. Specific genetic variations have been linked to myopia, affecting eye growth, development, and refraction. These genes are often related to connective tissues, neurotransmitters, and intracellular signaling. [2]

The likelihood of inheriting myopia increases if one or both parents have the condition, with the risk further escalating with the severity of parental myopia. [3] Additionally, ethnic patterns also suggest a genetic link, as Asian countries exhibit a much higher myopia rate than European countries or the United States. [3] However, the sources also acknowledge that environmental factors play a role in myopia development. [2, 3]

Given that myopia typically develops and worsens during childhood, genetic risk is most influential during this period. [4] Children with nearsighted parents require close monitoring as their eyes grow and develop refractive errors. Rapid myopia progression is particularly common between the ages of 8 and 15, making it a critical time for interventions to safeguard a child's eyesight and mitigate inherited risks. Implementing myopia control techniques at younger ages appears to have the greatest impact on slowing progression long-term. [4]

The sources emphasize the importance of recognizing warning signs of myopia onset in children, especially those with a family history of nearsightedness. These signs include: [5]

Squinting or eye-rubbing
Difficulty seeing the board at school
Avoiding reading or close work
Headaches after visual tasks
Sitting very close to the TV
Tilting the head or closing one eye
Holding objects close to the face
Any indication of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive eye exam to evaluate the child's vision. [6]

The sources also caution that high degrees of myopia can increase the risk of developing several blinding eye diseases in adulthood, including retinal detachment and tears, open-angle glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy. Early detection and management of myopia are crucial to preserving long-term eye health and function. [6]

Prevent Myopia From Worsening In Children
Practical Ways to Manage Myopia Progression in Children
While myopia, or nearsightedness, is not curable, the sources emphasize that its progression can be managed, especially when detected early [1, 2]. This is particularly important as myopia can lead to more serious eye conditions such as cataracts and detached retinas if left untreated [2].

The sources recommend several practical ways to manage myopia progression in children:

Increase Time Spent Outdoors: The sources stress the importance of outdoor time, suggesting a minimum of 90 minutes daily [3]. Bright, ambient light outdoors can help modulate correct eye development, encouraging the eye to focus on distant objects, thus slowing the progression of myopia [3].
Regular Eye Exams: It is crucial to have children's eyes checked at least once a year, even if they show no symptoms of myopia [2]. Early detection is key to managing myopia effectively. The sources emphasize that measuring the axial length of the eye is the most reliable way to determine if a child is at risk of nearsightedness [2].
Limit Screen Time: Excessive screen time and continuous near work are identified as major risk factors for myopia [4]. Activities such as computer use, drawing, and reading put significant strain on the eyes and can contribute to the development of nearsightedness [4]. The sources recommend limiting these activities and encouraging regular breaks to allow the eyes to relax [4].
Consider Myopia Control Options: The sources mention several options for myopia control, including:
Soft-multifocal contact lenses: While not specifically for treating myopia, these lenses can provide clear vision during the day and may offer some degree of myopia control [4].
Atropine eye drops: These drops help control myopia progression by slowing eyeball elongation and strengthening eye structures [5].
Overnight contact lenses: Worn during sleep, these lenses reshape the cornea to slow myopia progression [5].
The sources highlight that while myopia cannot be completely reversed, these methods can help to slow down its progression and potentially prevent future vision problems [6].

5 Spooky Things You Didn't Know About Myopia
Myopia: A Growing Concern
Myopia, or nearsightedness, is an eye disease that occurs when the eye grows too long, causing blurry distance vision. [1] Myopia often begins in childhood and tends to worsen throughout the school years, usually stabilizing between the ages of 18 and 22. [2] The sources note that myopia is a progressive condition. [2] This means that the degree of nearsightedness tends to increase over time, particularly during childhood growth spurts. [2]

The sources indicate that myopia affects approximately one in three children in the United States, and its prevalence has been on the rise over the past 30 years. [3] The sources suggest that this increase is potentially due to a combination of genetic factors and lifestyle changes. [4]

The COVID-19 pandemic, with its associated increase in screen time and decrease in outdoor time, appears to have further exacerbated the prevalence of myopia in children. [5] A 2020 study published in Ophthalmic Research found that spending time outdoors can help to slow down the elongation of the eye and reduce the risk of myopia. [5] Similarly, a 2013 study in Ophthalmology showed a correlation between increased time spent outdoors and a lower prevalence of myopia. [5] The study found that each additional hour spent outside per week was associated with a 2% reduction in myopia risk. [5]

While myopia cannot be cured, its progression can be slowed or even halted. [6] Treatment approaches, also known as myopia management or myopia control, aim to reduce or stop the rapid growth of the eye. [6] Effective myopia treatment involves more than just correcting blurry vision with glasses. [6] It seeks to prevent vision from deteriorating and lower the risk of developing severe eye diseases related to myopia in the future. [6]

The sources emphasize that high myopia and rapidly progressing myopia in childhood increase the risk of developing serious, sight-threatening eye diseases later in life, including:

Glaucoma [2]
Macular degeneration [2]
Myopic maculopathy [2]
Retinal detachment [2]
It's crucial for parents to prioritize their children's eye health. [1] This includes ensuring regular eye exams and considering myopia management strategies to prevent rapid disease progression. [1] Early intervention can significantly impact a child's present and future eye health. [4]

Myopia and What You Can Do For Your Child
Myopia Causes and Treatment
Myopia, or nearsightedness, occurs when the eye grows too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of on it. This results in blurred distance vision. [1] Myopia typically develops during childhood and progresses as the child grows, stabilizing in early adulthood when the body stops growing. [2]

Several factors contribute to myopia:

Genetics: Children with one or both parents who are myopic are more likely to develop myopia themselves. [3]
Excessive near work: Spending more than 3 hours per day on activities like reading or using electronic devices can contribute to myopia onset and progression. The intensity and duration of near work also play a role. [4] For example, intently reading a book for 45 minutes straight is more likely to impact a child’s eyes than briefly browsing a magazine. [4]
Lack of outdoor time: Studies have shown that spending at least 2-3 hours outdoors daily can help delay or prevent myopia in children. [3]
There are steps you can take to slow or stop myopia progression:

Regular eye exams: Annual or semi-annual eye exams are recommended to monitor myopia development and progression. [5]
Breaks from near work: Encourage children to take frequent breaks from near work activities to reduce eye strain and allow time for outdoor activities. [5]
Increased time in natural sunlight: Spending time outdoors exposes children to natural sunlight, which has been shown to have a protective effect against myopia. [6]
It is important to manage myopia effectively because it can significantly increase the risk of developing serious eye diseases in adulthood, such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration. [6] Consulting with an eye care professional can help identify appropriate management strategies, such as customized contact lenses or prescription eye drops, to slow down eye elongation and protect future eye health. [7]

3 Facts About Myopia You Should Know

The most common eye-related issue associated with this disorder is dry eye syndrome, which can cause discomfort. Other possible conditions include scleritis (inflammation of the white part of the eye) and uveitis (inflammation of the tissues in the eyewall). [2]
Multiple Sclerosis: This autoimmune disorder affects the central nervous system, which is directly connected to the optic nerve. Vision problems can be an early symptom of multiple sclerosis. One such problem is optic neuritis, which can cause color vision loss, blurred vision, and double vision, usually affecting only one eye. [3]
The article stresses the importance of consulting an eye doctor if you experience any vision problems, particularly if you have an autoimmune disorder. Lumen Optometric offers various eye care services, including comprehensive eye exams and contact lens fittings, to address vision concerns and promote eye health. [1, 3]

The Four Best Ways to Treat and Manage Myopia
This article from Lumen Optometric discusses four methods for treating and managing myopia, also known as nearsightedness. Myopia occurs when the eyeball grows too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it [1]. The article emphasizes that the discussed treatments have been scientifically proven to slow down the progression of myopia, as evidenced by their ability to reduce axial length elongation [1].

Treatment Options for Myopia
Custom Orthokeratology (Overnight Contact Lenses): Orthokeratology utilizes specially designed contact lenses worn only during sleep to reshape the cornea [2]. By gently flattening the cornea's curvature, these lenses redirect light onto the retina, improving vision [2]. Studies show this method effectively slows down myopia progression, potentially by changing optical signals received by the eye and reducing eye growth stimulation [2].
Atropine Eye Drops: Atropine, a pharmaceutical agent traditionally used to treat lazy eye and other eye conditions, has been found to slow down myopia progression when used in diluted concentrations [3]. Although the exact mechanism is not fully understood, atropine is believed to block certain eye signals that stimulate eye growth, thereby reducing axial length increase [3].
Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses: These lenses are designed with varying powers throughout the lens to focus light in front of the peripheral retina, addressing both vision problems and preventing excessive eye growth [4]. The MiSight contact lens, for example, has shown a nearly 60% reduction in myopia progression compared to control groups [4].
Special Myopia Treating Eyeglasses: Emerging eyeglass technologies aim to redirect light similarly to orthokeratology and multifocal contact lenses [5]. These glasses, ranging from large bifocals to lenses with specialized power rings, offer a promising alternative for individuals who cannot tolerate contact lenses or prefer non-pharmaceutical options [5].

Symptoms of Age-Related Macular Degeneration
This article from Lumen Optometric, titled "Symptoms of Age-Related Macular Degeneration," explains the different types and symptoms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common eye disease affecting older adults, and outlines how doctors diagnose it.

Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
AMD is an eye disease that primarily affects older adults, causing vision loss due to damage to the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. AMD doesn't lead to complete blindness but significantly impacts daily activities like reading, driving, and close-up work. [1]

Types and Symptoms of AMD
AMD is categorized into two types: dry and wet. Dry AMD, also known as atrophic AMD, develops gradually over years as the macula thins. Dry AMD progresses through three stages: early, intermediate, and late. In the early and intermediate stages, some individuals may not experience any symptoms, while others might notice slight blurring in their central vision. [2]

Wet AMD, or advanced neovascular AMD, is a less common type of late AMD characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels behind the eye, ultimately damaging the macula. Wet AMD leads to faster vision loss compared to dry AMD. While dry AMD can progress to wet AMD, wet AMD is always considered late-stage. [3]

Individuals with late AMD might experience distorted vision, seeing straight lines as wavy or crooked. They may also develop a blurry area near the center of their vision, which can expand over time. Some report seeing blank spots or difficulty seeing in low light. Experiencing any of these symptoms requires immediate consultation with an optometrist. [3]

Diagnosis of AMD
An eye exam is an effective method to determine the presence of AMD. To accurately diagnose AMD, your eye doctor might perform additional procedures, including: [4]

Distance and near vision acuity tests: These tests assess your ability to see clearly at various distances.
Dilated eye examination: This involves dilating the pupil to allow the doctor to examine the macula at the back of the eye using an ophthalmoscope.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) testing: This non-invasive imaging technique creates high-quality images of the macula and its supporting layers, providing a detailed view of the eye's structure.
The article concludes by encouraging readers with eye care concerns to contact Lumen Optometric for professional assistance, highlighting their services, including corneal reshaping. [5]

These exams can identify myopia in its early stages, allowing for timely intervention and potentially slowing down its progression.
Exploring Treatment Options

While there is no cure for myopia, the sources express optimism about available treatments that can effectively slow down its progression. They recommend consulting with a myopia management eye doctor to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for each child.

Customized Contact Lenses: The sources mention specialized contact lenses, such as orthokeratology lenses and multifocal lenses, as effective options for myopia control. These lenses work by gently reshaping the cornea or influencing eye growth signals to reduce the rate of myopia progression.
Prescription Eye Drops: Atropine eye drops, traditionally used for amblyopia (lazy eye), have also shown promising results in slowing down myopia progression in children.
The sources highlight Treehouse Eyes as a specialized provider of myopia treatment for children. However, it's important to note that this information comes directly from Lumen Optometric, which partners with Treehouse Eyes, and could be biased. You may want to independently verify this information and explore other potential providers in your area.

The Role of Myopia Management Eye Doctors

The sources stress that managing myopia in children goes beyond simply prescribing corrective lenses. Myopia management eye doctors specialize in assessing a child's risk for myopia, recommending appropriate treatment options, and monitoring their progress. Early intervention and proactive management can significantly reduce the risk of developing high myopia and its associated complications, protecting a child's vision for the future.
