Dr. Eric To is great, he takes the time to explain everything during the examination and answers all of your questionsK.G.Our experience has always been a positive one.

Great addition to Sierra Madre!DrewThe staff here is the best staff I have ever interacted with in the medical industry, hands down. They are extremely knowledgeable, professional, excellent at communicating, and super prompt. They are also so quick to reply via email and they even text. That is seriously so impressive.

Given its complexity, it’s essential to understand the facts about the condition rather than believing the common myths often shared online or by friends and family.\\n\\nKnowing more about AMD can help you take steps to prevent or delay its progression, so here are statements you can overlook to maintain your vision for years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMyth #1: AMD Is a Disease That Only Affects Older Adults\\xa0\\nAMD is an eye condition caused by deterioration in part of the retina, called the macula. This area at the back of your eye helps you see things with sharp detail and color when looking straight ahead—for example, when reading or driving a car—but it does not affect peripheral vision like looking out into the distance around you.\\xa0\\nWhile researchers are still working to understand what causes this macular degeneration, it’s likely due to age combined with other risk factors such as smoking, obesity and genetics.\\xa0\\nWho is at risk of AMD? People over age 50 have an increased risk of developing early stages of this condition; however, younger people may also be diagnosed if they have certain genetic mutations associated with these conditions.\\nMyth #2: There Is No Cure for AMD\\nThough there currently isn’t a cure for late-stage AMD, treatments are available depending on which type has been diagnosed. Dry AMD has no treatment yet, but recent studies indicate that some dietary changes may slow its progression.\\xa0\\nLifestyle changes that can help include eating leafy green vegetables rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, as well as omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil might reduce inflammation throughout your body, including within your eyes. Similarly, maintaining good overall health by exercising regularly, eating healthy foods, quitting smoking and protecting yourself from UV light will help lower ocular inflammation.\\nMyth #3 All Vision Loss From MDM Is Irreversible\\xa0\\nTreatments such as intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medications and photodynamic therapy can help improve vision in some cases. Other treatments such as laser therapy, vitrectomy, cataract surgery and low vision aids can also help reduce AMD’s effects. Early diagnosis and management are key to preserving your sight longer with AMD.\\nTime to Get Checked\\nIf you are over 50 or have any other risk factors for developing AMD, you should get an\\xa0eye exam with your doctor. If you live in the Sierra Madre area, Lumen Optometric can provide comprehensive eye exams to help detect AMD early and offer recommendations for treatment and management. We also provide other ophthalmologic services and products, such as\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0and\\xa0orthokeratology.

There is NO scientific evidence to support the claims that contact lens wear is unhealthy during these times. For the vast majority of contact lens wearers, their contact lenses are inserted and removed at home, with no manipulation throughout the day. When worn properly, contact lenses are cleaned or disposed of on a daily basis. In contrast, glasses typically are not disinfected every day!\\n\\n\\nFiled Under: covid-19 Tagged With: contact lens, contacts, covid-19, healthyPrimary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

That’s why millions of people wear these lenses for several hours on a daily basis. However, despite being a common device used to correct vision, it’s not unusual for some contact lens wearers to forget a thing or two about contact lens safety.\\n\\n\\nGenerally, contact lenses are safe when they are worn responsibly and cared for properly. Whether you are new to wearing contacts or you have been a long-time contact lens wearer, make sure that you follow these 10 important rules listed by\\xa0neurons treatment\\xa0expert Lumen Optometric.\\nDon’t sleep in your contact lenses. Closing your eyes while wearing your lenses reduces oxygen and makes the surface of your eye more vulnerable to infection.Don’t wear your contacts when you are in the shower, swimming pool, ocean, or hot tub. Tap water, seawater, and the water from lakes, rivers, and pools harbor organisms that can cause an eye infection.Have your contact lenses fitted by a qualified eye care professional. And make sure to follow their instruction on when to replace your contacts. Using lenses for longer than the manufacturer’s recommendation will increase your risk for eye infection as protein buildup could occur. If you are also using\\xa0dry eye treatment, ask your doctor about precautions on wearing contacts, if any.Always use fresh contact lens solutions every time you store your contact lenses in their case. Never reuse solution or top off old solution since the disinfecting ability of the old solution is already gone.Never use saline water for disinfecting or cleaning your contact lenses. Saline solution is just sterile saltwater, so it has no ability to clean or disinfect contacts.Wash your hands with soap and water before touching your contact lenses. Make sure to completely rinse and dry your hands.Clean your contact lens case using a multipurpose contact lens solution. Let it dry during the day and make sure to replace it every month.Check your contact lenses for tears or chips. Although these lenses are soft, a tear or a chip can still scratch your eye. It’s best to discard your lenses if they have been damaged.Discard your lenses if they land on the floor or in the sink.If you are using reusable lenses, make sure to rub the lenses with a multipurpose contact lens solution. This will help remove debris or protein buildup.\\nLumen Optometric Need to consult a\\xa0scleral optometrist? Visit Lumen Optometric to get excellent and personalized eye care services.

The obvious benefits of fresh air and physical exercise aren’t the only perks for kids who play outdoors. Recent research shows that increased “sun time” can actually slow down the progression of myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), or even postpone its onset!\\n\\n\\nBut First, What Is Myopia and Why Is It Harmful?\\nMyopia is an eye disease that causes the eye to elongate more than it should, resulting in blurry distance vision.\\xa0 It’s caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, two of which are not spending enough time outdoors and doing excessive near work like device use.\\nMany parents aren’t aware that childhood myopia significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration later in life. It’s been shown that higher myopia is associated with a greater risk of eye disease.\\nThat’s why it’s important to stop myopia in its tracks with myopia management.\\n3 Reasons Why Outdoor Play Benefits Your Child’s Eyes\\nWhether your child is currently nearsighted or not, spending time outdoors in the sunshine can help delay the onset of myopia or slow its progression.\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0 The Brightness of the Sun\\nThe sun’s visible light is significantly brighter than the lighting in almost any indoor setting, which may play a major role in controlling myopia.\\nStudies have shown that when sunlight comes in contact with the retina, it causes the release of dopamine into the eye. This may prevent the eye from elongating. Preventing the eye from growing too long is the main goal of myopia management.\\nWhat is certain: children who spend at least 2-3 hours playing outdoors in the sunshine progress less rapidly than children who spend almost all their time indoors.\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0 Long-Distance Focusing\\nIt is well established that prolonged near activities like reading and screen time contribute to myopia onset and progression. It’s no surprise that studies now show COVID-19 confinement may have caused higher rates of myopia in children as well.\\nSpending time outdoors, on the other hand, encourages your child to focus on distant objects like trees, basketball hoops, a ball flying through the air— anything that’s more than an arm’s length away.\\xa0\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0 Vitamin D\\nVitamin D helps smooth muscle tissue around the eye’s crystalline lens allowing it to function properly.\\nThis smooth muscle helps focus light on the retina, and may also help maintain the proper eye shape and length between the lens and the retina, which can become distorted as a child’s eyes grow with every passing year.\\nMoreover, the sun’s invisible UVB light triggers Vitamin D production. Some studies have found that nearsighted individuals have lower levels of Vitamin D than those with normal vision. However, more research is needed to solidify this claim, as only small-scale studies have been performed.\\nThe recommended time for daily outdoor play is at least 2 hours for children over the age of 6. Be sure to send your child outside with a water bottle, sun hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.\\nAt Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to battle childhood myopia and preserve children’s eye health for the long term. We encourage parents to learn more about myopia and check out real stories from satisfied parents and children sharing their experiences with our professional doctors, staff, and myopia treatment protocols at Treehouse Eyes.\\nPrevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling your child’s myopia consultation today.

The more you know about workplace eye safety, the better you can protect your eyes and the longer you can enjoy clearer and healthier vision. Lumen Optometric, the area’s leading specialist in\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0and other eye care services, shares some of the things you can do to protect your eyes in the workplace.\\n\\n\\n1. Wear the necessary eye protection.\\xa0Those whose career is in construction work, engineering and landscaping tend to be more at risk of eye-related injuries. If you belong to any of these fields, make sure that you always wear the applicable eye protection. Doing so not only keeps you safe but also ensures you’ll be able to carry out your tasks in a more efficient manner.\\n2. Reduce exposure to blue light.\\xa0People working in construction, engineering, and other physically demanding jobs run the risk of developing eye problems, but this doesn’t mean those working in the office aren’t exempt. Staring in front of a computer screen can make office employees more prone to digital eye strain. Its symptoms may include headaches, fatigue, dry and watery eyes, and blurred vision. If you’re experiencing these yourself, schedule a consultation with a premier\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0like Lumen Optometric promptly.\\xa0\\nYou can also take steps to lower your eyes’ exposure to blue light. Using an anti-glare screen on your computer can help. You may also adjust screen brightness or position the monitor in such a way that it’s not directly facing a bright light source.\\n3. Follow the 20-20-20 rule.\\xa0For every 20 minutes of screentime, take a 20-second break and look at an object 20 feet away. You don’t even need to stay seated as you do this.

By limiting your child’s screen time, you help your child to experience the many benefits. As a parent, you should be mindful of how much time your child spends on devices. You might be wondering, how can a parent help in preventing eye diseases in their children? Well, it all starts with limiting screen time. Here are several ways for you to do just that.\\n\\nSet Expectations\\nThe first step to limiting your child’s screen time is to let them know what you expect. Set clear expectations early on, explaining why you are limiting their screen time and why it’s important for them to spend more time playing outside or reading books. If they have concerns or questions about limiting their screen time, listen and address them before setting the limit so that they understand why it is important to follow these rules. You can even make a deal with your child: if they spend 30 minutes doing something other than using screens, then they can watch TV or play video games for 30 minutes afterward (or whatever works best). However, don’t give in to demands—be consistent!\\nSet a Timer\\nSetting a timer is an effective way to limit your child’s screen time. Not only will it remind them when their allotted time is up, but it can also help them keep track of how much time they’ve spent on various activities as well. You can choose from several apps that are available for download onto your smartphone; or if you prefer, there are physical timers out there as well (like ones with bells). If using an app, simply select the length of time that you want your child to spend looking at screens and set the alarm accordingly. Once this is done, you can set up notifications to alert you every hour so that if anything goes wrong—or if any inappropriate material is being viewed—you’ll know about it right away.\\nCreate a “Tech-Free” Zone in Your Home\\nYou can create a “tech-free” zone in your home by choosing a room or space that is free of all screens and then putting them there. This could be your child’s bedroom, or it could be a quiet spot in the house where you can enjoy each other’s company without distractions. This will allow everyone to relax and disconnect from technology while they’re at home, which may help prevent screen time overload and overstimulation when using technology later on.\\nLead by Example\\nThe most effective way to control your child’s screen time is by monitoring your own usage as well. While it is important to set limits for your child, you need to be aware of how much time you are spending in front of a screen as well. Children will often mimic their parents, so if you want them to cut back on their own screen time, then it’s best for parents to do the same thing first.\\nChoose Treehouse Eyes For Better Vision\\nIt’s important for your child to develop social skills and human interaction. You can’t do this if they’re glued to their screens. It also helps them learn how to manage their distractions, which is an important life skill that will help them get through things like school and work.

To ensure that your child can do well in class, you will need to manage their refractive error. This usually means going to a trusted local eye doctor for prescription eyeglasses. But not every child wants to wear eyeglasses, especially those who are active in sports and other physical activities. This makes contact lenses a more attractive option, but is your child actually ready for them? Lumen Optometric, the leading eyecare provider in the area, shares how you can know.\\n\\n\\n1. Your child is asking if they can wear them.\\xa0The decision to wear contact lenses will depend on the child. If wearing eyeglasses makes them unhappy and uncomfortable, then they will be far more motivated to take good care of their contact lenses.\\n2. They make an effort to be clean and hygienic.\\xa0Proper use and care of contact lenses is a big responsibility. Cleanliness should always be observed to ensure safety and comfort and to prevent infections and other eye problems. If your child knows the importance of cleanliness and makes an effort to practice good hygiene, then they should be ready to wear contacts.\\n3. Your child does their chores without being asked repeatedly.\\xa0A certain amount of discipline is required on the part of the child when it comes to contact lens use. The proper cleaning and storage of contact lenses are akin to doing household chores. When they don’t need to be told twice about what needs to be done, then they’re already a good candidate for contact lenses.\\n4. They are active in sports.\\xa0Eyeglasses get in the way of your child’s athletic interests. By letting them wear contacts, they can maximize their potential in sports, allowing them to perform well while enjoying clearer vision.\\nYour Premier Eyecare Specialist\\nDo you think your child is already ready for contact lenses?

One of these problems is diabetic eye disease, which can severely damage your vision. Diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the conditions that result from this disease.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFortunately, Lumen Optometric is here to share four steps you can take to prevent or slow down diabetic eye disease.\\n1. Undergo a Dilated Eye Exam Annually\\xa0\\nDiabetic patients are highly advised to visit a dilated\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0at least once a year. In this assessment, your ophthalmologist will identify early signs that diabetes is affecting your eyesight. Typically, diabetic eye diseases only show a few symptoms until the condition has advanced. If your vision starts to blur due to diabetes, consult a professional immediately to determine the best treatment for you and save you from irreversible vision loss.\\n2. Manage Your Blood Sugar\\nKeep your blood sugar level in your target range by eating food that is low in sugar and carbohydrates, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood sugar. For personalized assistance, consult a primary care physician, an endocrinologist or a nutritionist. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor.\\n3. Control Your Blood Pressure\\nManaging blood pressure can protect your eyes from diabetic retinopathy, which is a complication of diabetes that damages the retina. If your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are high, your tiny fragile blood vessels would react negatively, resulting in serious eye damage. In the event that your eye condition has worsened, call your eye doctor right away for\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0or other treatments.\\n4. Maintain an Active and Healthy Lifestyle\\nA balanced diet and regular exercise can help control your diabetes, which can benefit your eye health. As much as possible, avoid consuming processed and fried food, an excessive amount of red meat, high-sugar beverages, and food with refined carbohydrates. For a hassle-free mealtime, you can ask your diabetic care team to create a meal plan that works for you and provides you with enough energy to maintain an active lifestyle.\\nFor outstanding diabetic eye care, you can rely on us at Lumen Optometric. We provide comprehensive eye examinations,\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0and other optical solutions.

Besides giving you the ability to see, they let you learn new skills and interact with others. Taking good care of your eyes goes a long way in maintaining good vision and avoiding sight-threatening conditions. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA local\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0specialist gives five tips to keep your eyes healthy.\\xa0\\n1. Schedule Regular Eye Exams\\nRoutine comprehensive eye exams help diagnose various eye conditions in their early stages, including glaucoma, cataracts and age-related eye conditions. Sometimes, they also allow specialists to catch signs of other health problems, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.\\xa0\\nHow often you need to get your eyes checked typically depends on your age and family history of eye disease. You may need to visit an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0more frequently if you have an existing medical condition.\\xa0\\n2. Keep Your Eye Prescription Up-to-Date\\nFrequent headaches, constant squinting and blurred vision are common signs you need to update your prescription eyewear. If you feel relief when you remove your glasses, it definitely means you need a new pair. Moreover, experts recommend getting new corrective eyeglasses every two years.\\xa0\\n3. Protect Your Eyes From the Sun\\nYour eyes are just as susceptible to sun damage as your skin. When heading outdoors, be sure to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat is another thing you can do to protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays.\\xa0\\n4. Maintain a Healthy Diet\\nEating well-balanced meals will benefit your eyes and overall well-being. Incorporate foods high in zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins A, C, and E into your diet. Leafy greens, nuts, fish, and colorful fruits and vegetables are especially rich in these nutrients.\\xa0\\n5. Stay Hydrated\\nYour eyes could suffer if you don’t drink enough water. Blurred vision, eye fatigue and a stinging sensation in the eyes are typical signs of dehydration. Drink at least eight glasses of water daily to hydrate your eyes and body.\\xa0\\nDon’t wait before you experience significant changes in your vision before seeing an eye doctor. Lumen Optometric is here to handle your eye care needs. Whether you need new eyeglasses or\\xa0contact lenses, we’re here to help.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0at Lumen Optometric share daily habits that can benefit your eyes and vision.\\n\\n\\n1. Wash Your Hands\\xa0— Thanks to recent events, hand washing should already be part of your daily routine coming from the outdoors. Even if you stay indoors most of the time, you should wash your hands regularly. Common vision-related diseases like conjunctivitis (pink eye) are caused by touching in or around the eyes with unclean hands.\\n2. Wear Eye Protection\\xa0— Whether you’re mowing the lawn, doing some woodwork in your workshop, or performing home repairs, don’t risk eye injury and always wear eye protection. Protective glasses are easy to obtain, comes in many sizes, and can be worn over existing eyeglasses. If you’re working on anything that involves welding, make sure to wear a welding mask or goggles.\\n3. Handle Your Contact Lenses Carefully\\xa0— Your contact lenses come into direct contact with your eyes; you’ll definitely want to keep them clean. Always make sure that you’re handling them with clean hands, keep your contact lens cases sterilized, and discard expired contact lens solution. If you’re undergoing\\xa0dry eye treatment, your eye doctor may prescribe a different type of contact lenses, with different handling instructions. Make sure you follow them closely to avoid damage to your eyes.\\n4. Maintain a Healthy Diet\\xa0— Eating fast food every day probably won’t make you go blind, but it’s not good for your health, either. Various studies have shown that a diet that contains significant amounts of foods that are rich in Omega-3 and lutein can help reduce the risk of cataracts, night blindness, and other eye problems.\\n5. Rest Your Eyes\\xa0— Most of us spend a significant portion of the day staring at computer screens, especially those who work from home. Make sure to rest your eyes every once in a while. The “20-20-20 Rule,” is a good daily practice to turn into a habit. The rule is simple: every 20 minutes, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Doing this several times a day can help reduce eye strain.\\nLumen Optometric is your leading provider of eye care services, including\\xa0Neurolens® treatment. Give us a call at (626) 921-0199.

But how much do you really know about this eye disease?\\nSome parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye.\\nBelow, we’ll explore 5 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about your child’s eye health and long-term vision.\\n\\n1. Myopia is an Eye Disease\\nMyopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football.\\nBecause the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia.\\n2. It’s More Common Than You Think\\nMyopia is an eye disease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people worldwide. If things don’t change, half of the world’s population will have some degree of myopia by the year 2050!\\n3. It’s a Progressive Condition\\nMyopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school-age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens.\\nBecause the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age.\\n4. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease\\nMyopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight-threatening eye diseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment later in life.\\nChildren with high myopia have a 50% higher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop cataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults than children who don’t have myopia.\\nMyopia is more than just a matter of clear vision — a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided their children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic maculopathy fell by 40%.\\n5. Myopia Can Be Managed\\nAt Treehouse Eyes, we know how important your child’s eye health is to you, and we’re here to help! We offer the latest and most effective myopia management treatments to limit the progression of myopia so that your child can live his or her best life.

In fact, there are many reasons to have them spend time outdoors, not least of which is to protect your child’s vision. Studies show that children who spend time playing outdoors in the sunshine experience less myopia progression than those who stay indoors. Moreover, encouraging more outdoor playtime is important for promoting overall health and wellbeing in your kids.\\nBelow we’ll explore some fun outdoor activity ideas to try with your kids and discuss why spending time outdoors may slow a child’s myopia progression or even postpone its onset.\\n5 Outdoor Activities to Do With Your Kids This Winter\\n1. Snow Play\\nIf you live in a snowy region, bundle up your kids in warm layers and have them:\\n● Build a snowman\\n● Enjoy a snowball fight\\n● Paint the snow with some food coloring or watercolors\\n● Make a snow maze\\n● Build an igloo\\n● Build snow castles (the same way you would sand castles)\\n● Make snow angels\\n● Collect snowflakes during a snow flurry and study their beautiful shapes\\n2. Blow Ice Bubbles\\nKids love playing with and popping bubbles. If temperatures are low enough, they might freeze in mid air! They’ll get a kick out of watching them freeze and possibly catching or popping them.\\nTo make your own bubble solution, mix 1 part water with 4 parts dish soap and a few drops of light corn syrup. It’s best to try this activity when winds are calm, as harsh breezes can cause the bubbles to pop before they freeze.\\nOnce the bubbles have landed on a surface and are completely frozen, they are beautiful to photograph — which can be part 2 of this activity.\\n3. Go Sledding\\nSledding is a classic winter activity that your child will love. To go sledding, all you need is snow, a sled, and a hill! Easy enough.\\nBut before you hit the slopes (or hills), be sure to follow these safety guidelines:\\n● Choose a sled that can be steered and can brake\\n● Wear a helmet\\n● Dress warmly, but be careful as the scarf can get caught under the sled\\n● Children 5 years old and under should sled with an adult\\n4. Go on a Winter Scavenger Hunt\\nA winter scavenger hunt is a wonderful way to explore nature with all of your senses. Before you head out, make a list of things to see, smell, listen for, and feel. Ask your child to check each item off the list.\\nFor example, your list can include listening for the sounds of birds chirping, footsteps crunching in the leaves, or water babbling in a nearby stream. On the list of things to look for, you can include different types of trees, animals, animal tracks, cloud shapes, birds’ nests, and more. Take your camera along and let your child take pictures of what they find.\\nYou can also leave an empty space on the list for your child to fill as they explore new things on their own.\\n5. Decorate a Tree with Edible Ornaments For Animals\\nThis activity is an unconventional twist on building a bird-feeder and perfect for those who live near a forest. The idea is to make edible ornaments and hang them on a tree (or potted plant in your garden) for wildlife to feed on during the winter.\\nYour ornaments can be made using various seeds, peanut butter, dried fruit, and popcorn. It’s best to use biodegradable materials to hang your ornaments, and don’t use fishing lines, as birds can get caught in it.\\nWhat’s the Connection Between Time Outdoors and Myopia?\\nThere is increasing evidence that children who spend extra time daily playing outdoors have a reduced risk of developing myopia; and if they already have myopia, time spent outdoors could slow down the worsening of this condition, also known as myopia progression.\\nThese findings are significant, as having myopia significantly increases a child’s risk of developing sight-threatening eye diseases later in life. Moderate to high levels of myopia make a child more susceptible to developing cataracts, retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and glaucoma later in life.\\nAt Treehouse Eyes, our mission is to battle childhood myopia by providing myopia management to nearsighted children. Our myopia management treatments can effectively slow down your child’s myopia progression and reduce their future risk of eye disease.\\nIf your child has myopia, or if you need your first consultation, contact us today to schedule a myopia eye exam.\\nWishing you and all of our patients a healthy and enjoyable winter season!\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Primary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

This way, your trusted optometrist can detect any conditions or diseases that may trouble them later on. Which eye conditions are these exactly? Lumen Optometric, the trusted eye exam doctor\\xa0in the area, offers a quick overview of some of them.\\n\\nRefractive Errors\\nThese refer to conditions that can cause blurry vision. Refractive errors include farsightedness (hyperopia), when close objects appear distorted, nearsightedness (myopia), when objects viewed at a distance are blurry and astigmatism, when objects both near and far are unclear. They may occur when the cornea doesn’t bend, or refract, light properly. Symptoms include a disinterest in reading or viewing distant objects and squinting or turning the head in an odd fashion when watching television.\\nChildren diagnosed with refractive errors can be treated through prescriptive glasses, and even\\xa0corneal reshaping, or orthokeratology (Ortho K). The latter refers to the use of gas-permeable lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia, hyperopia and refractive errors. Ortho K is a safe and effective alternative to eyeglasses, refractive surgery, or contact lenses.\\nAmblyopia\\nAnother common eye problem in babies and young children is amblyopia or ‘lazy eye’. This happens when the vision of one or both eyes did not develop properly during childhood, or when eye conditions, such as refractive errors, weren’t corrected promptly.\\nStrabismus\\nAlso known as cross-eyes, strabismus is when the eyes aren’t aligned properly–instead pointing at different directions. This causes loss of depth perception because the child learns to ignore the image received by the misaligned eye, relying only on the one from the straight, or better-seeing eye. Treatment options for strabismus may include eyeglasses and vision therapy.\\nPtosis\\nWhen the upper eyelid droops and restricts or blocks vision, this is called ptosis. A child with this condition may tip their head back, lift up their chin, or raise their eyebrows to try to see better, which may cause head or neck problems over time. Visit your local eye doctor for a thorough eye exam if your child exhibits these symptoms.\\nColor Deficiency\\nAlso called color blindness, this eye problem makes it difficult for the child to distinguish specific shades of color. This is usually an inherited condition, but there are also certain diseases that can cause color deficits. While there is no cure for color deficiency, there are special glasses and\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0your child can wear that allow them to see color differences.\\nTo prevent or avoid lasting vision problems for your child, make sure to visit a premier eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a regular eye exam.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0at Lumen Optometric shares a quick guide on contact lens solutions.\\n\\n\\nMultipurpose Vs. Hydrogen Peroxide Solutions\\nThere are two types of contact lens solutions: multipurpose and hydrogen peroxide-based. They serve the same purpose — disinfect your contacts and remove debris — but they work in different ways.\\nMultipurpose solution, also known as all-in-one solution, is simple to use. Wash your hands, put your contacts in your palm, then moisten the lenses with the multipurpose solution. While some types of multipurpose solutions are marketed as “no rub” products, experts recommend rubbing the lenses with it for 10 seconds to remove remaining debris. Apply a drop of saline solution in each lense to rinse before wearing it.\\nHydrogen peroxide solution, on the other hand, requires more time or attention. Unlike multipurpose solutions, this type of contact lens solution does not “spoil,” and is ideal for people who are sensitive to certain chemicals, or for those undergoing therapy like\\xa0dry eye treatment. Hydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at disinfecting contact lenses, but it must not touch the eye directly. To use it, fill a small case with the solution (most contact lenses come with such a case) and soak them for six to eight hours. Before taking out the contacts, a neutralizer must be applied to turn the hydrogen peroxide to a plain saline solution.\\nWhich One Should You Choose?\\nBetween the two, the multipurpose solution is the more cost-effective and easy-to-use, and can be used virtually anywhere as long as you have a contact lens case or a clean surface to clean them in. However, it is not as effective at disinfecting contact lenses as the hydrogen peroxide solution. Making it an all-in-one solution requires certain chemicals that may not be ideal for some people who may be sensitive to certain substances. This also means it has a shorter shelf life.\\nThe hydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses, but there is a risk of harming the eye if one were to forget applying the neutralizer. It is also important not to reuse or top off the solution after use. Contact lens cases must also be replaced every one to three months to cut the risk of infection.\\nLumen Optometric is your leading provider of eye care services, including\\xa0Neurolens treatment.

But apart from the style of your eyeglass frame, you should also look into the frame materials.\\n\\n\\nLumen Optometric, a trusted\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0and eyeglass provider, discusses some of the most popular materials used for eyeglass frames.\\nTitanium\\nTitanium is commonly used in designer glasses. It is an excellent material for eyeglass frames and hinges because it is very lightweight, sturdy, hypoallergenic and corrosion-resistant. However, titanium is significantly more expensive than other frame materials. Titanium alloy, which is a combination of titanium and other metals, is typically used as a cheaper alternative to titanium.\\nStainless Steel\\nStainless steel is a reliable material for eyeglass materials. It’s durable, strong, hypoallergenic and non-corrosive. It may not be as lightweight as other materials, but it can be easily shaped into ultra-thin eyewear frames. Stainless steel is also flexible, and this usually adds to the comfort of eyeglass wearers. So whether you are wearing glasses most of the time or you’re only using it temporarily while undergoing\\xa0dry eye treatment, this type of frame material can be really comfortable for you.\\nPlastic\\nZyl or propionate is typically used in making the plastic frame material. Zyl, which is also known as cellulose acetate, is the most common type of plastic frame material. Meanwhile, propionate is the second most popular plastic frame material. It is hypoallergenic and nylon-based, and it has a different look and feel than other types of plastic.\\nLumen Optometric has expertise in different kinds of eye care services. Whether you’re considering\\xa0Neurolens treatment\\xa0or you’re simply looking for a new pair of glasses, our staff will ensure that your needs are met.

What’s less well-known is what these different eye conditions are. Presbyopia is one of these diseases. It’s a condition that usually affects people aged over 40 and makes it harder for their eyes to focus on objects. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing small print, such as text messages, clearly.\\nNo need to worry though—to help restore your vision, a\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0will prescribe you multifocal lenses if you’re a good candidate for one. In general, there are three types of multifocal lenses:\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBifocal lenses\\xa0– As the name suggests, bifocal lenses have two prescriptions: the upper lens helps you see objects from afar while the lower lens helps you read and focus on objects near you.Trifocal lenses\\xa0– Like bifocal lenses, trifocal lenses have upper and lower lenses that help you with distance vision and reading respectively. The difference between the two is that trifocal lenses, as the name suggests, have a middle section that helps you with tasks that require intermediate vision, like using a laptop.\\xa0Progressive lenses\\xa0– Progressive lens don’t have the lines found on bifocal or trifocal lenses. That’s because the power of the lenses gradually changes from the top to the bottom.\\xa0\\nAdjusting to Your New Bifocal Lenses\\xa0\\nMultifocal lenses will take some getting used to. Here are some tips on adjusting to your new multifocal lenses:\\xa0\\nWear your multifocal lenses all the time\\xa0– You’ll get used to your new multifocal lenses faster if you wear them all the time.\\xa0Don’t look down while walking or going down the stairs\\xa0– The lower part of your bifocal lenses makes everything look bigger, so your feet may appear out-of-focus. If you need to look down while walking, make sure to tilt your head up and look through the upper portion of your multifocal lenses.\\xa0Make sure your new multifocal eyeglasses fit your face properly\\xa0– It’s harder to get used to multifocal eyeglasses and lenses if they don’t fit your face properly.\\xa0\\nFor more info about your multifocal lenses,\\xa0neurolens treatment, and your other treatment options, don’t hesitate to consult your eye doctor.\\xa0\\nLooking for eye specialists near you?\\xa0\\nLumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including\\xa0dry eye treatment services.

This assessment is crucial to diagnosing, preventing and treating eye conditions that could lead to vision loss. To help you further understand what dilated eye exams are, Lumen Optometric is here to answer the most commonly asked questions about this process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What Is a Dilated Eye Exam?”\\nA dilated eye exam involves pupil dilation, which is a simple and painless procedure performed to increase the size of the pupils. This process allows your ophthalmologist to assess the health of your optic nerve and retina. If you are nearsighted or farsighted, your eye doctor will give you dilating eye drops to check vision problems that hinder you from seeing clearly.\\n“What Conditions Can It Detect?”\\nGlaucoma, macular degeneration, retinal detachment and ocular tumor are some of the conditions that can be diagnosed with a dilated eye exam. This procedure provides optimum viewing of the dilated pupil, which allows for the diagnosis and monitoring of the retina. While there are some diseases that can be detected without pupil dilation, a dilated eye exam is still important to ensure an accurate and complete diagnosis.\\n“What Can I Expect During the Exam?”\\nWhen your eyes are dilated, your vision may be blurry and your eyes may be sensitive to light for a few hours. For your safety, ask a loved one to drive you home from your eye appointment. In case your eye doctor finds refractive errors in your vision, they may provide you with a prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses to help improve your eyesight.\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we are committed to providing only the best eye care services to help you take care of your vision problems.

This treatment can help with tired eyes, eye fatigue and headaches. The neurolenses® that we provide use patented and clinically tested technology to correct your eyes’ misalignment. Are you curious about the neurolens treatment\\xa0and want to learn more? In today’s article, Lumen Optometric answers some frequently asked questions about neurolenses.\\n\\n\\nHow Does It Work?\\nThe neurolens Measurement test will determine if you are a good candidate for neurolenses. These lenses are the first and only prescription lenses that can help correct the misalignment in a patient’s vision at all distances. Using neurolenses has been found to relieve symptoms like neck pain/tension, eyestrain, headaches and eye fatigue.\\nHow Often Should I Use It?\\nYour trusted\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0from Lumen Optometric recommends that you wear your neurolenses during all your waking hours for the best results. If this is not possible, then you should at least wear these lenses while doing near work like reading or using a digital device. In general, you should see results with your neurolenses within your first three to seven days of wearing them. Some patients might take longer however, sometimes taking up to three weeks.\\nDoes It Still Work If I Use Contacts or If I Have 20/20 Vision?\\nYour new neurolenses incorporate both your regular eyeglasses prescription and your contoured prism prescription. If you prefer wearing contact lenses, then you can order your neurolenses to only use your contoured prism prescription. You’ll just need to wear your neurolenses while wearing your contacts. This also means that people with 20/20 vision can still use neurolenses if they suffer from misalignment.\\nWe provide a comprehensive range of eye care services including\\xa0dry eye treatment,\\xa0eye exams and more.

During these visits, we welcome and address questions or concerns that parents have about their child’s eye health.\\n\\nBecause certain myopia treatments include contact lens wear, many parents ask whether they’re safe to wear for young children. Here’s what the research says:\\nA recent study, Adverse Event Rates in The Retrospective Cohort Study of Safety of Paediatric Soft Contact Lens Wear: the ReCSS Study, shows that contact lenses for children are just as safe for children as they are for adults. (This study appears in the January 2021 issue of the peer-reviewed Journal of Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics.)\\nThe study followed 963 children aged 8 to 16 over the course of 1.5 to 3 years (for a combined 2713 years of contact lens wear time) to determine the risk level associated with wearing soft contact lenses. All of the subjects were 13 years of age or under at the time of their first fitting, with more than half of the children fitted with soft contacts at or before the age of 10, on average.\\nThe study results indicate that age doesn’t play a role in contact lens safety. In fact, the risks of developing adverse reactions to contact lens wear among children proved to be the same as in adults. According to the study, the rate of inflammatory conditions associated with contact lens wear were less than 1% per year of wear.\\nMultifocal Lenses for Myopia Management\\nOne effective method of myopia management includes the use of MiSight daily multifocal soft contact lenses. MiSight contact lenses are FDA approved for the treatment of myopia and have been shown to effectively slow down the rate of myopia progression.\\nMany parents like this method as it requires minimal maintenance; at bedtime, the child discards the pair they are wearing, and inserts a fresh pair in the morning.

Many eye clinics offer these tests that you can accomplish via your smartphone. They claim to determine how sharp your vision is, if you have astigmatism, or experiencing eye sensitivity. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nDiscover if online eye tests are any good and when they are useful from a local\\xa0eye exam doctor.\\xa0\\nAre Online Eye Tests as Good as Visiting Your Eye Doctor?\\nTypically, an online eye test only checks your visual acuity and gives an estimate of your refractive error. Sometimes, it includes contrast sensitivity and color blindness. However, this kind of test can’t determine if you have conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, or macular degeneration.\\xa0\\nKeep in mind that routine eye exams with your eye doctor are still irreplaceable. Get your eyes checked as frequently as advised by your eye specialist. Regular comprehensive eye exams can help with the early detection and treatment of different eye conditions, especially those that don’t show symptoms until their later stages.\\xa0\\nWhen Are They Helpful?\\nWhen you’re away, and you break or lose your glasses or\\xa0contact lenses, that’s when online eye tests are most useful. Sometimes, an online vision test can help keep track of your eyesight and refractive error between routine eye exams. Still, it helps to know that the results of some online eye tests have been validated with limited studies because it’s still a new and developing technology. More studies are required to ensure the accuracy of prescriptions generated by online vision tests.\\xa0\\nFor your family’s eye care needs, turn to Lumen Optometric.

It’s the first of its kind and the only type of lenses that can provide relief and help alleviate symptoms of misalignment such as headaches.\\nIt is different from the glasses you’re probably used to since it uses patented and clinically tested technology to correct your misalignment.

While they are a common, albeit harmless, condition among infants, blocked tear ducts developing in adults may indicate an underlying problem. Lumen Optometric, the trusted\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0in the area, shares more of the essentials you need to know.\\n\\n\\nWhat Can Cause Blocked Tear Ducts?\\nThere are many different reasons blocked tear ducts can occur. These may develop because of an age-related change, when the tiny openings (puncta) that allow tears to drain become narrower, which can cause a blockage. Other common reasons include infection of the eyes, tear duct system, or nasal passages. An injury or trauma can also result in blocked tear ducts. This can be as minor as foreign particles getting lodged in the eyes, or as serious as a blow to the head or a broken nose. \\xa0\\nWhat are the Symptoms of Blocked Tear Ducts?\\nWatery eyes and excess tears streaming from the eyes may be signs of a blocked tear duct. But these may be accompanied by:\\nRedness and irritation of the affected eyeCrust forming along the eyelidsExcess mucus or discharge from the eyesEye infections, like pink eye or conjunctivitisPain and inflammation of the inside corner of the eyeBlurred vision\\nYou should note, however, that watery eyes due to cold or sinus infection may be unrelated to a blocked tear duct. The same goes for swelling or redness in the eyes, which may be a result of an injury that doesn’t affect the tear ducts. When you’re experiencing some or most of the symptoms mentioned above, you should go see Lumen Optometric, your trusted local eye doctor promptly. We don’t just specialize in\\xa0dry eye treatment–we can also manage a number of other eye conditions.\\nHow Do You Deal with Blocked Tear Ducts?\\nWhile a blocked tear duct can result in discomfort and swelling, it is almost always correctable. Its treatment will depend on its underlying cause. To accurately pinpoint the reason for your blocked tear ducts, we’ll perform a comprehensive eye examination and, depending on the results, recommend the effective and appropriate solution.\\nWhether you need to deal with blocked tear ducts or considering\\xa0neurolens treatment, Lumen Optometric has got you covered. We’ll ensure a lifetime of clear and healthy vision with our specialized eye care services. We proudly serve Sierra Madre, CA and the rest of San Gabriel Valley.

The main source of blue light is the sun but it can also come from your digital devices, LED lights, television screens, and fluorescent lights. Fortunately, there is no known evidence that blue light from screens is damaging to a child’s eyes.\\xa0\\nDo Blue Light Glasses Work?\\nKids who spend hours in front of screens are more prone to develop digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome. Among the most common signs of this eye condition are eye fatigue, headaches, shoulder or neck pain, changes in vision, and dry eye. To keep track of your child’s vision and ensure their eyes are healthy, visit your eye doctor regularly. At Lumen Optometric, you can count on us to take care of your child’s eyes. We specialize in myopia treatment,\\xa0dry eye treatment, and more.\\xa0\\nBlue light glasses are available in prescription and non-prescription lenses. These glasses have a slight yellow tint to the lenses and can help prevent digital eye strain in children. However, these glasses do not completely filter all blue light but they can reduce your child’s exposure by up to at least 80 percent. Still, the best way to prevent this eye condition is limiting your child’s screen time, especially for younger ones.\\xa0\\nFor your family’s eye care needs, Lumen Optometric is here to help. We offer\\xa0neurolens treatment, scleral lenses, orthokeratology, and more.

Let’s explore the efficacy of correcting visual habits in mitigating its advancement. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent ocular condition with multifaceted causes and implications. In this post, we delve into whether myopia can worsen despite corrected visual habits.\\n\\nThe Mechanisms of Myopia Occurrence:\\nThe journey of myopia onset is intricate and begins before visual symptoms manifest. Research indicates that the eye undergoes accelerated axial growth one to two years before myopia becomes clinically evident. During this period, compensatory mechanisms within the eye attempt to counteract the elongation, including the flattening of the anterior surface of the lens. However, these mechanisms eventually exhaust themselves, leading to the establishment of myopic refractive status—an early-to-mid stage irreversible pathological change.\\nThe Influence of Age on Myopia Progression:\\nUnderstanding the age at which myopia sets in is crucial in predicting its progression. Studies suggest that the earlier myopia occurs and the faster it progresses, the less responsive it is to interventions aimed at improving visual habits. This underscores the importance of early detection and intervention in younger individuals to potentially mitigate the severity of myopia progression.\\nChallenges in Eliminating Causative Visual Habits:\\nWhile correcting visual habits is a fundamental aspect of managing myopia, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges associated with eliminating causative factors. Factors such as excessive near work, limited outdoor time, and genetic predispositions contribute to myopia development. Despite concerted efforts to modify these habits, complete eradication remains elusive, posing a continued risk for myopia progression.\\nConclusion :\\nIn conclusion, the journey of myopia progression is complex, and influenced by various factors including age, genetic predispositions, and environmental habits. While correcting visual habits is beneficial, it’s crucial to recognize the limitations in eliminating causative factors. Early intervention remains key in potentially slowing down myopia progression, emphasizing the importance of regular eye exams and proactive management strategies. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed to empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources to navigate their myopia journey effectively.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child.

It ensures that your eyes have enough moisture and rest to perform well. If you are not getting enough sleep, this could affect your eyes and increase your risks of various side effects ranging from mild (dark circles and puffy eyes) to severe (eye infections and vision loss).\\n\\n\\nLumen Optometric, a trusted provider of\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0and eye care services, further discusses the negative impact of poor sleeping habits on your overall eye health.\\nEffects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Eyes\\nOne common but less dangerous effect of poor sleep is having dark circles underneath your eyes. Some people, though, are more prone to having puffy eyes rather than dark circles after a night of inadequate sleep. In other cases, when people are not able to get enough sleep, they experience eye spasms and twitching throughout the day. This often makes it difficult to do work or activities like reading. It can also pose hazards if you are driving.\\nAnother usual side effect of sleep deprivation is having strained, dry and itchy eyes the next day. This is a slightly more serious effect of poor sleep. Dry eyes specifically can be painful and it can cause irritation. This is mainly because your eyes are not getting proper lubrication. Lack of sleep may also cause your eyes to be sensitive to light or your vision to be blurry.\\nPeople who don’t get enough sleep have an increased risk of glaucoma, a condition caused by excessive buildup inside the eye. If you have been experiencing these symptoms more frequently, make sure to visit an eye exam doctor. You should also address the source of your eye symptoms — in this case,\\xa0poor sleeping habits.\\nTips on Improving Your Sleep\\nRemember that your eyes go through a lot whenever you’re awake. They work several hours a day, so it is important to give them enough time to recover through sleep. If you are having problems getting a good quality of sleep, here are some tips that might help you:\\nExercise regularly. This can help you sleep better, but make sure to avoid it three hours before your bedtime.Get as much sunlight as you can during the day.As much as possible, avoid exposure to blue light and digital screens at least two hours before bedtime.Consider wearing an eye mask if you get stimulated even by the faintest of lights at night. You can also try blackout blinds to prevent outdoor lights from seeping into your bedroom.\\nLumen Optometric provides exceptional eye care by ensuring that every patient receives quality service that meets their specific needs.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says 90% of these incidents are preventable. Generally, the kind of eye protection you need depends on the potential hazards present in your workplace.\\xa0A local\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0expert shares some of the most common causes of workplace eye injuries.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Are the Common Causes of Workplace Eye Injuries?\\nFlying Objects\\nDoes your job involve sanding, riveting, chiseling, hammering, riveting or machining? If so, you must wear appropriate eye protection like safety glasses, face shields or goggles. These tasks can expose you to small flying objects that can enter your eyes, including metal fragments, wood particles and cement chips.\\xa0\\nChemicals\\nYou must be careful when working with chemicals because they can cause irreversible eye damage. Proper safety gear will protect your eyes from chemical splashes, fumes and vapors. Gasoline, grease, oil and paint thinner can also harm your eyes.\\xa0\\nObject or Tool Penetration\\nPermanent eye damage can occur due to the penetration of tools or sharp objects. When this incident happens, seek medical attention immediately. Always wear safety glasses and avoid tools you have no experience using.\\xa0\\nRadiation\\nLasers and welding equipment can produce high levels of infrared, ultraviolet radiation and heat. Workers need to wear safety goggles when performing tasks involving these tools. Doing so will protect them from eye problems like cataracts, retinal burns and blindness.\\xa0\\nWhich Eye Problems Usually Occur at Work?\\nDigital Eye Strain\\nMany jobs today require you to stare at digital screens for hours. If you spend a significant time in front of a computer, you might experience digital eye strain. Headaches, dry eyes and blurred vision characterize this condition. It can also cause neck and shoulder pain. These symptoms can occur due to glare on screens, poor seating posture and improper viewing distances.\\xa0\\nUncorrected refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism can also trigger digital eye strain symptoms. The only way to know if you need prescription eyeglasses or\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0is to get an eye exam. Moreover, taking breaks from computer screens and ensuring good lighting will help alleviate eye strain.\\xa0\\nEye Infection\\xa0\\nUsually, eye diseases spread in the workplace through droplets from sneezing or coughing. You might develop an eye infection if you accidentally touch your eyes with contaminated hands. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis occurs from exposure to Staphylococcus species and other bacteria. Its symptoms include eye redness, burning and a sensation of having something inside the eye. Artificial tears, antibiotics and other topical medications are the common treatment options for this eye condition.\\nRegular visits to your\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0will go a long way in keeping your eyes healthy and maintaining good vision. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care needs.

You may be dealing with what’s known as computer vision syndrome (CVS). An\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0and eyecare expert explores the causes and symptoms of CVS and how this condition can be corrected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCauses and Symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome\\nExtended screen time, a lack of sufficient lighting, poor posture and bad visual habits can lead to computer vision syndrome. Over time, our eyes have a hard time focusing and refocusing on digital screens, causing multiple discomforts.\\nThe main symptoms of CVS include difficulty shifting focus, dry or itchy eyes, recurrent headaches, and blurred or double vision. In some cases, it may also cause neck, shoulder, and back pain, creating a ripple effect on your overall well-being.\\nCan Computer Vision Syndrome Be Corrected?\\nThe good news is that computer vision syndrome can be corrected. It is not a permanent condition, so your vision can improve significantly with the right approach and professional help. Here are just some of the methods that can be employed:\\nEye Exercises\\nSpecific eye exercises can be suggested by your\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0to alleviate the symptoms of CVS. These exercises can help strengthen your eye muscles and improve your eyes’ ability to focus.\\nPrescription Glasses\\nIn some cases, prescription glasses specially designed for computer use may be recommended. These glasses have coatings to reduce glare and block harmful blue light emitted by digital screens.\\nVision Therapy\\nThis is a customized program of visual activities designed to correct specific vision problems and improve visual skills. Vision therapy can help treat CVS by training the eye muscles to reduce strain and improve visual comfort when using screens.\\nLubricating Eye Drops\\nDry eye is another symptom of CVS, and you can use lubricating eye drops to combat it. These drops help replenish your eye’s surface and maintain moisture.\\nEnvironmental Modifications\\nThis could include adjusting the lighting in your workspace to reduce glare, positioning your computer screen at an optimal distance and angle, and increasing the font size on your screen to reduce eye strain.\\nLumen Optometric: Your Partners in Eye Care\\nCount on Lumen Optometric to guide you in reclaiming your vision health.

During this appointment, your eye care professional will assess your eyes and determine the most suitable type of contact lenses for your needs. Here’s what you can expect during your contact lens fitting session.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssessment of Your Eye Health and Vision Needs\\nYour eye care professional will begin by reviewing your medical and eye health history. This examination includes a check of visual acuity, an evaluation of eye movements and an examination of the general well-being of your eyes to determine whether eye conditions might affect your suitability for wearing contact lenses.\\nPrecision Measurements for a Perfect Fit\\nFollowing the eye health assessment, the optometrist or ophthalmologist will meticulously measure the curvature and diameter of your corneas. These measurements are crucial for determining the correct size and type of contact lenses that will provide the best fit for your eyes, preventing discomfort and potential complications. For instance, scleral lenses are larger than standard contact lenses and rest on the white part of your eye, the sclera. Due to their design, optometrists perform a more detailed fitting process for scleral contact lenses than regular contacts.\\nTailoring to Your Lifestyle and Preferences\\nYour lifestyle and preferences play a significant role in the recommendation of suitable contact lenses. The eye care professional will take into account factors such as your level of physical activity, preferred wearing schedule and specific vision correction needs. Communicating your preferences ensures personalized recommendations.\\nFollow-Up Appointment\\nA follow-up appointment is typically scheduled after a week or two to ensure you adapt well to your new contact lenses. Your eye care professional will check for any changes in eye health and may adjust your prescription or lens type if necessary. They can also help you identify issues like dry eyes that could affect lens comfort and recommend dry eye treatment as needed.\\nContact lens fitting is a comprehensive process that requires professional expertise for the best outcome.

Worry not—we’re here to clear up all the confusion. Read on as Lumen Optometric explains why, when, and how your contact lenses may impact your examination results.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShould You Wear or Not Wear Contact Lenses for an Eye Exam?\\nEye exams sometimes involve more than just reading a standard eye chart. There can be several tests, each targeting a different aspect of your eye health. The primary concern with leaving your lenses in during the exam is the potential for inaccuracies. Contact lenses can disguise certain eye conditions or changes in your prescription. They might also obscure indications of dry eye, a condition that demands effective treatment early on.\\nAs such, it is preferable to take contact lenses out at least two hours before the appointment. Doing so allows your cornea to revert to its natural shape—which can be altered by prolonged contact lens wear—ensuring a more accurate examination.\\nDiscussing Your Contact Lens Concerns During an Eye Examination\\nDuring your eye exam, be sure to discuss your contact lens experiences with your eye care provider. This way, they can evaluate your eyes with them on and off. For instance, if you mention issues with blurry vision or eye fatigue, they might consider a neurolens treatment, a revolutionary option for correcting misalignments and bringing comfort. Likewise, if you’re a candidate for scleral lenses, they will have a specialized understanding of your contact lens fitting. Lenses should not just correct vision but should also promote overall eye health.\\nReach Out to Lumen Optometric\\nTaking off your contact lenses before an eye exam is often beneficial, allowing your optometrist to conduct a more comprehensive and precise test. For any of your eye health concerns, look no further than Lumen Optometric!

But in order to get the most out of your contact lenses, you’ll need to make sure they’re worn properly. Some people, for instance, leave their contact lenses in for too long, which is risky and highly discouraged. Lumen Optometric, the premier\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0in the area, explains more.\\n\\n\\nWhy You Shouldn’t Overwear Contact Lenses\\nAvoid wearing your contact lenses for too long in a day, and you absolutely shouldn’t leave them on when you sleep. Doing so can lead to complications with your eyesight. In fact, prolonged contact lens use may cause the wearer to experience the following symptoms:\\nInflammation of the cornea, or keratitisRedness and swelling of the conjunctiva, or the transparent skin covering the whites of the eyesEyelid swellingLight sensitivityBlurred visionDry eyesBurning sensation when the contact lens are inserted\\nBut How Long Is ‘Too Long’?\\nThe period may vary with each patient, but it’s generally recommended that\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0are worn for a maximum of 10-12 hours each day. Anything longer than that can put the eyes at risk of infection and discomfort. If you’re using contact lenses for the first time (and don’t have dry, sensitive eyes) your eye care specialist may suggest wearing them for 6-8 hours on that first day.\\nHow to Deal With Overwear\\nIf you’ve left your contact lenses for too long and are now experiencing adverse effects, the first thing you’ll need to do is visit a trusted eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a comprehensive eye exam and the necessary solution. Our eye specialists will suspend contact lens wear until all the symptoms have been resolved.

This condition pertains to the clouding of the lens of the eye. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 17.2% of Americans older than 40 have cataracts in one or both eyes.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile a common eye condition, many myths still surround cataracts. A local\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0specialist debunks five of them.\\xa0\\n1. Cataracts Only Occur in Older Adults\\nOne of the most popular misconceptions about cataracts is that they only occur in older adults. The truth is they can be present at birth. Cataracts can also develop in younger individuals, and some medications can increase your risk for cataracts, such as corticosteroids.\\xa0\\n2. Overusing Your Eyes Can Cause Cataracts\\nHow much you use your eyes doesn’t have anything to do with your risk of developing cataracts. However, cataracts can make doing up-close work more challenging. While healthy lifestyle changes can’t prevent cataracts, they can slow down the eye condition’s progression.\\xa0\\n3. Eye Drops Can Treat Cataracts\\nNo eye drops can prevent or dissolve cataracts. Cataracts are not growths but changes in the structure of the lens. Removing and replacing the affected lens is the only way to treat this eye condition. If you have cataracts, only an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0can determine which treatment option suits you.\\xa0\\n4. Cataract Surgery Is Risky\\nCataract surgery is one of today’s safest procedures, with a success rate of 95%. It’s painless and only takes around 15 to 20 minutes. You can usually leave the hospital a few hours following the surgery. Most patients recover within four weeks, but some notice a significant improvement in their vision a few days after the procedure.\\xa0\\n5. Cataracts Can Go Back Following Surgery\\nOnce the affected lens has been replaced, cataracts will not recur. However, some people may experience cloudy vision because the membrane holding the synthetic lens can decline with age. Fortunately, a quick and safe in-office laser procedure can address this issue.\\xa0\\nAre you experiencing changes in your vision? Let Lumen Optometric assess your vision and eye health.

However, beware of what is and isn’t true about your eyes. Doing your research and learning the truth can help you better take care of your eyes.\\n\\n\\nA local\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0debunks some of the most common myths about vision and eye health.\\xa0\\nReading in the Dark Is Harmful to Your Eyes\\nYour mom has probably told you that you shouldn’t read in the dark because it will damage your eyes. Reading in low lighting conditions may lead to eye fatigue or a headache but it can’t cause permanent damage.\\xa0\\nConstantly Wearing Your Glasses Will Weaken Your Eyes\\nWearing glasses will not make your eyes weak. While some eye conditions will get worse over the years, it doesn’t have anything to do with glasses. Moreover, your glasses are there to help you see better and correct your vision.\\xa0\\nUsing Digital Devices a Lot Is Bad for Your Eyes\\nUsing your phone, computer, and other digital devices for an extended period can result in eye fatigue. However, it will not result in nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. To avoid eye strain, make sure you’re taking breaks in between using your devices. It would also help to wear the right eyewear. At Lumen Optometric, we offer\\xa0neurolens treatment\\xa0and other vision correction options.\\xa0\\nEating Carrots Will Make Your Vision Better\\nAnother common myth about your vision is that it will improve by eating carrots. This vegetable is rich in vitamin A, which is necessary for you to maintain good eyesight. However, your body only needs a tiny amount of vitamin A for vision and you can get it from other sources like fish, dairy, darky leafy greens, and bright-colored vegetables.\\xa0\\nLooking for a reliable\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0or eye care provider?

In this blog post, we’ll explore this topic and examine the existing evidence surrounding the relationship between sleep patterns and vision in children and teenagers.\\nThe Link Between Sleep Habits and Vision:\\nCurrently, there’s a lack of direct clinical trial evidence confirming the precise impact of sleep habits on vision. However, intriguing findings from animal models provide suggestive insights into this connection. Disrupting the overall circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep-wake cycles, may potentially influence refractive development in the eye.\\nUnderstanding the Role of Circadian Rhythm:\\nThe eye is a complex organ, with various components operating on their own biological rhythms. These include the cornea, choroid, intraocular pressure, and lens. Disrupting these biological rhythms can affect the rate of eye growth, potentially impacting vision development over time.\\nIndirect Evidence and Myopia Risk:\\nWhile direct clinical evidence is lacking, indirect evidence from animal models suggests that staying up late and waking up late—common habits among children and teenagers—may increase the risk of myopia. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent vision condition characterized by difficulty seeing distant objects clearly.\\nConsiderations and Caution:\\nIt’s essential to interpret these findings with caution and recognize the limitations of extrapolating animal model data to human populations. While suggestive, these findings do not provide definitive answers regarding the impact of sleep habits on vision in children and teenagers.\\nConclusion:\\nIn conclusion, the relationship between sleep habits and vision in children and teenagers remains an area of ongoing research and investigation. While animal model studies suggest a potential link between disrupted circadian rhythms and vision development, direct clinical evidence is needed to confirm these findings in human populations.\\nFostering healthy sleep habits for children is essential for overall well-being, including their vision health. Encouraging consistent sleep schedules and adequate rest may contribute to optimal vision development. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed to staying informed about the latest research and providing comprehensive care to support your child’s myopia treatment journey.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child.

This sensation is typically associated with dry eye and seasonal allergies, even though the difference between the two is often muddled. This may be due to the fact that both conditions can affect our eyes simultaneously, the symptoms overlapping. Fortunately, with a specific dry eye treatment and simple lifestyle tweaks, your visual issues can still be corrected.\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Dry Eye?\\nDry eye is a common problem that is likely to occur after age 50. It is a condition experienced by people who don’t have enough quality tears to lubricate and nourish their eyes. Dry eye can occur due to several causes, including tears not being made properly and tears evaporating too fast.\\xa0\\nOther patients may have a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, where the glands in the eyelids become clogged, preventing the production of oil found in tears. More than 86% of all patients with dry eye have this condition. Another possible reason for dry eye is ocular misalignment which can be corrected by neurolens treatment.\\nIs It Seasonal Allergies?\\nThe symptoms of seasonal allergies can be similar to dry eye, but the indicating sign is itchiness. When the eye is exposed to an allergen like pollen and pet dander, histamines are released, causing the eyes to itch or tear. If seasonal allergies are affecting your eye, taking antihistamine can be quite effective to fight the inflammation. There are other steps you can take to ease your allergy symptoms.\\n\\nClose the windows and doors in your eyes when the pollen count is high outdoors.\\n\\nUse clean mattress covers on your bed to prevent dust mites.\\n\\nUse a dehumidifier in your home when humidity levels are high to prevent the growth of mold and mildew.\\n\\nWear sunglasses when you’re outside to help keep pollen out of your eyes.\\n\\nWhen experiencing a severe dry eye, it’s safer not to assume the cause and instead seek out professional advice from an eye doctor or a scleral optometrist.\\xa0\\nHere at Lumen Optometric, we can expertly determine the cause of your symptoms and prescribe the appropriate treatment plan.

Read on to discover how sports eyewear can help improve your performance and where you can find personalized eyewear solutions just right for your sport of choice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefits of Wearing Sports Eyewear\\nThe right sports eyewear can be a game-changer in the following ways:\\nEnhancing Visual Performance\\nStepping up your game begins with seeing the game better. Sports eyewear, whether it’s a simple pair of sports glasses or customized\\xa0contact lenses, can significantly enhance your ability to focus and see clearly. For every basketball player aiming for the hoop or a tennis player watching out for the incoming serve, better vision equals better performance.\\nProtective Features\\nBeyond improving your vision, another crucial reason to wear sports eyewear is to protect your eyes from potential injuries. High-speed sports like hockey or racquetball create numerous opportunities for errant balls or pucks to cause serious harm to your eyes. Protective sports eyewear can guard against these risks and provide peace of mind as you play.\\nImportance of Correct Prescription and Fit\\nJust like the right cleats or a cozy pair of gloves, having the proper prescription and fit for sports eyewear is essential. An incorrect prescription can defeat the purpose of wearing eyewear and hinder your game performance. Similarly, eyewear that doesn’t fit securely can become a distraction or slip off at an inconvenient time. It’s crucial to consult an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0to ensure your prescription is up-to-date and your eyewear fits well.\\nDifferent Types of Sports Eyewear\\nDepending on the sport, there are many types of eyewear to choose from.\\nSports Glasses\\nThese are excellent for those who require a prescription for their vision but also need the structural robustness to withstand physical sports. Sports glasses typically have reinforced frames and lenses to maintain their shape and performance.\\nPrescription Sports Goggles\\nFor those involved in high-impact sports, prescription sports goggles offer a higher level of protection. They fit snugly to your face to prevent any foreign objects or harsh sunlight from impairing your vision.\\nSports Sunglasses\\nFor those sunny outdoor games, sports sunglasses not only improve your vision but also shield your eyes from harmful UV rays, helping to prevent long-term eye damage.\\nLumen Optometric: Enhancing Your Sports Performance\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we aim to help you find the ideal eyewear for your sporting needs. We offer comprehensive eye exams to ascertain your precise prescription and\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0services for those looking for a lens-free solution.

These are often serious and need medical attention.\\xa0Neurolens treatment\\xa0specialist Lumen Optometric has shared below what you need to do if you have the following injuries:\\n\\n\\nEmbedded Foreign\\xa0Object\\nIf an object, such as a piece of glass or metal, penetrates or enters the globe of the eye and/or is sticking out, you’ll need to call for emergency medical help or bring the child to the emergency room as soon as possible. You should also cover the affected eye with a small cup taped in place so that it keeps all pressure off the eye. Make sure to keep your child (and yourself) as calm and comfortable as possible until help arrives.\\nIrritations\\xa0\\nIf your child has dirt, sand, or other foreign bodies on their eye surface, our resident\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0recommends that you wash your hands thoroughly and examine the eye. Don’t touch, rub, or press the eye itself except by flushing, as other methods can easily scratch the surface, especially the cornea.\\nNext, tilt your child’s head over a basin or sink with the affected eye down and gently pull down the lower lid. Encourage your child to open the eyes as wide as possible, but if it’s an infant or small child, it’s helpful to have a second person hold the child’s eyes open while you flush.

It can cause damage to your eye’s optic nerve and can lead to permanent vision loss. While there’s still no cure for this condition, early detection and treatment can help slow its progression and prevent vision loss.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\xa0neurolens treatment\\xa0specialist shares essential things you should know about glaucoma.\\xa0\\n\\nCertain Groups of People Are at Higher Risk\\nAll people can get glaucoma but there are groups of individuals who are at higher risk. People over 60, individuals with a family history of glaucoma, diabetes patients, and African Americans over 40 are more likely to develop glaucoma. People with diabetes\\xa0have twice the risk of getting glaucoma. Glaucoma is also six to eight times more likely to occur in African Americans than whites.\\xa0\\n\\nRoutine Eye Exams Helps With Early Detection and Treatment\\nSeeing your eye doctor regularly can help with the early detection and treatment of glaucoma. Your eye care specialist may prescribe eye drops to keep the condition from progressing. If you are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma, you may need to schedule eye exams more frequently. Whether you need an eye exam or\\xa0dry eye treatment, Lumen Optometric is here to help.\\xa0\\n\\nA Healthy Lifestyle Can Help You Avoid Vision Loss\\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle and eating a nourishing diet can help you avoid glaucoma-related vision loss. It will also help to control your blood pressure, maintain a healthy weight, and quit smoking if you do. These good habits are also great for preventing type 2 diabetes and other health conditions that can harm your eyes and vision.\\xa0\\n\\nLooking for a\\xa0scleral optometrist?

It is gas-permeable and it creates a saline-filled reservoir over your eye’s cornea. Scleral lenses can be used to treat various corneal conditions and they are among the safest and most effective forms of visual correction.\\n\\n\\nTo help get satisfactory results and to ensure that your scleral lenses continue to be safe and reliable as you use them, scleral lenses and\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0expert Lumen Optometric shares some tips below.\\nKnow When to Remove Your Lenses\\nMost scleral lens wearers can comfortably wear their lenses for 12 to 14 hours. However, experts recommend taking the lenses off one hour before you go to sleep. Moreover, if your lenses fog throughout the day and you feel like you need to remove them already, don’t hesitate to do so. Typically, fogging occurs as a result of poor alignment of the lens with the eye. In this kind of situation, the lens rocks and causes mucus to form. The mucus then becomes trapped in the saline layer of the lens, which causes the blurry vision. That said, it is important to get the best fit of scleral lenses for your eyes in order to minimize filming or fogging.\\nRub Lenses After Removing\\nMake sure to rub your lenses after removing them so as to remove surface debris. You can ask your\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0to demonstrate the proper way of doing this so that you can avoid damaging the lenses. Generally, it is ideal to rub each lens for two to 20 seconds, depending on your care solution.\\xa0\\nUse a Filling Solution With No Preservatives\\nA preservative-free filling solution is the best way to keep your eye’s health at an optimum level. Regular eye drops can cause damage to your eyes and your lenses because these often contain preservatives, so you should avoid using them at all times.\\nLumen Optometric offers a range of eye care services.

Do you experience these two problems at the same time as well? Is there a way to avoid or lessen their effects?\\xa0Dry eye treatment\\xa0experts from Lumen Optometric share some info!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDry Eye and Migraines\\n\\xa0\\nStudies have been conducted on the theory of dry eye and migraines being involved with one another and worsening the effects of both. A study titled\\xa0Tear Osmolarity and Subjective Dry Eye Symptoms in Migraine Sufferers\\xa0was made in 2017 and was made to explore this correlation.\\n\\xa0\\nTear osmolarity refers to the amount of salt content in an individual’s tears. Tear osmolarity is a regular test for dry eyes, as the higher the salt content of a person’s tears, the more prone they are to dry eye. In the above-mentioned study, they had 34 migraineurs in the research group, and during the observation period, migraine attacks were generally accompanied by dry eye. Additionally, the more frequent the migraine attacks became, their tear osmolarity also increased.\\n\\xa0\\nTo summarize, the study focused on the link between migraines, dry eye, and tear osmolarity. And during the study, when migraines occurred, the effects of dry eye were also observed. And the more migraines with severe pain and discomfort the research subjects experienced, the saltier their tears became, resulting in them becoming more susceptible to dry eye.\\n\\xa0\\nDry Eye Treatment\\n\\xa0\\nContact lens users are very susceptible to the effects of dry eye, and these lenses need the right amount of lubrication to function comfortably on the surface of the eyes. If you’re someone who uses a contact lens and has been having bouts of dry eye, contacting your\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0or nearest eye clinic would be the best course of action.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re getting dry eye that comes with migraine, lessening the effects of both is possible by getting the proper dry eye prescription and taking standard medications against migraines. Commonly, treatment for dry eye is done by the use of artificial tears, as dry eye happens when your eyes can’t get the right amount of lubrication they need. With eyes that lack the proper amount of lubrication, artificial tears are the optimal way to address dry eye. They are available over-the-counter and come in the form of liquid, gel, or ointment types. If your eyes are always tearing up and lessening your tear reserves, getting assistance from an eye care clinic and requesting tear duct plugs is a good way to prevent dry eye.\\n\\xa0\\nContact Us!\\n\\xa0\\nHave problems with migraines and neck pain?

Determining the cause of your eye discomfort can be tricky, and getting the correct diagnosis and treatment to find relief is essential. Continue reading to learn the difference between eye allergies and infections, their symptoms, and when it’s time to seek professional help.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptoms of Eye Allergies\\nIf you’re dealing with an eye allergy, some common symptoms might include itching and redness, as well as watery or teary eyes. Your eyelids may also appear swollen and you could experience sensitivity to light. These symptoms are usually caused by your body’s immune response to allergens, leading to inflammation and discomfort.\\nSymptoms of Eye Infections\\nOn the other hand, eye infections often come with different symptoms, such as pain or discomfort in the eye itself. You may notice yellow, green, or bloody discharge and crusting around the eye. Blurry vision or vision loss can be associated with eye infections too, so it’s essential to pay close attention if you notice any of these signs.\\nCauses of Eye Allergies\\nEye allergies can be triggered by various factors, such as seasonal allergens like pollen and grass or indoor allergens like dust mites and pet dander. Irritants such as smoke, perfume or chemicals can also cause allergic reactions in your eyes, making them feel itchy and uncomfortable.\\nCauses of Eye Infections\\nEye infections, on the other hand, can arise from bacterial infections (like staphylococcus or streptococcus), viral infections (such as herpes or adenovirus) or even fungal infections (like aspergillus or candida). These types of diseases can be more severe and require immediate attention from a medical professional.\\nDiagnosis and Treatment\\nIf you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, it’s crucial to consult a professional for a proper diagnosis. At Lumen Optometric, we offer a variety of treatments to address your specific needs. For instance, our\\xa0Neurolens treatment\\xa0is an excellent option for those experiencing eye strain and discomfort. If your eyes are feeling chronically dry and irritated, our\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0can provide much-needed relief. If you wear contact lenses, our skilled\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0can help fit you with the most comfortable lenses possible.\\nPrevention Tips\\nTo help prevent eye allergies and infections, it’s essential to practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly. Avoid allergens and irritants as much as possible, and keep your living space clean to minimize exposure to indoor allergens. Regular eye exams and check-ups are also crucial to catching any potential issues early on.\\nIf you’re experiencing any of the above-mentioned symptoms, contact Lumen Optometric in Sierra Madre, CA, at\\xa0(626) 921-0199\\xa0or fill out our\\xa0online form\\xa0to schedule an appointment right away.\\n\\n\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Tagged With: eye allergy, eye infection, optometristPrimary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

Even if your vision seems clear, getting routine eye exams is essential. Many people aren’t even aware of an eye problem until they see an eye specialist.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA local\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0shares why regular eye exams matter even if you have 20/20 vision.\\xa0\\nKeep Track of Vision Changes\\nYou will never know if your vision has changed or if you need to start wearing prescription glasses until you see a specialist. Eye doctors will perform various tests to trace even the slightest changes in your vision.\\xa0\\nRegardless of age, you should schedule regular eye exams. It will ensure you have the appropriate vision correction eyewear, allowing you to see clearly and comfortably. Your eye doctor can also determine if you need\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0during your appointment.\\nEarly Detection of Vision-Threatening Conditions\\xa0\\nSpecialists can catch early signs of sight-threatening conditions during comprehensive eye exams. Cataracts, macular degeneration and glaucoma are some eye problems that don’t manifest apparent symptoms until in their later stages. Early detection and treatment are crucial in preserving vision and delaying the progression of these eye conditions.\\xa0\\nCatch Signs of Other Health Issues\\nYour eyes can say a lot about your overall health. It isn’t uncommon for eye doctors to detect indications of other health issues while assessing their patients’ eyes. If this is the case, they will encourage you to get further assessments from a medical practitioner. Common conditions caught during comprehensive eye exams include diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, multiple sclerosis and thyroid diseases.\\xa0\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we will thoroughly assess your eyes to catch problems that can affect your vision. Let us help you monitor your vision and eye health! Aside from comprehensive eye exams, we also offer myopia, dry eye and\\xa0neurolens treatment.\\xa0Call us at\\xa0(626) 921-0199\\xa0or complete our\\xa0online form\\xa0to schedule an appointment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Tagged With: eye doctor, eye exams, eyeglassesPrimary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

We believe in helping our patients by providing them with the information that they need to safeguard their vision and eye health. We strongly suggest scheduling comprehensive eye exams every one to two years and familiarizing yourself with some of the early signs of eye conditions. In today’s article, your trusted\\xa0eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric discusses the eye symptoms that you shouldn’t ignore.\\n\\n\\nDouble Vision\\n\\nIf you experience double vision when both of your eyes are open, then it might mean that your eye muscles aren’t aligned properly. Possible causes for this condition can include serious neurological problems, so you need to take this symptom seriously. If you only have double vision in one eye, then you might have an issue related to your retina or a cataract. We recommend scheduling an appointment with us immediately so we can figure out the cause of this problem.\\nItching and Burning Sensation\\n\\nIf you feel an itching and burning sensation in your eyes then you might have a condition called blepharitis. This condition is caused by bacteria or microscopic mites that live on your eyelids. Other possibilities include a painful inflammation of the eyelid’s oil gland, infections, styes, or overexposure to UV rays. As an expert in\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0and eye exams, we can figure out the cause of this symptom.\\nSudden Increase in Floaters\\n\\nIf you experience a sudden increase in the number of floaters, then you need to see your eye doctor as soon as possible. This can indicate that the retina and blood vessels have been torn. If you also see flashes of light, then this can be a sign of retinal detachment. Fortunately, eye doctors have a lot of options when it comes to treating this condition. The treatment depends on the location and size of the tear.\\nIf you need to schedule an eye exam, then give Lumen Optometric a call. We offer comprehensive eye exams,\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0and other vision care services. Our mission is to create an exceptional eye care experience using the latest research and technology. Our eye care professionals focus on balancing your visual clarity, health and comfort.

For people with poor vision, eyeglasses are their windows to a clearer and more vivid world, so making sure that their glasses are well-maintained and properly cared for is a high priority. If you wear glasses, there are a few things that you should keep in mind to keep your eyeglasses in an optimal condition, and\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0experts from Lumen Optometric are here to help!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWiping\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t use wet wipes, napkins, or paper towels. These cleaning materials are made of wood pulp and have roughly textured surfaces that can scratch the lenses of your eyeglasses and can affect the coating on them too. As much as you need to, avoid using the hem or the edge of your clothes in cleaning them as well. Unless your shirt is made purely with cotton, wiping your lenses with it can cause more trouble in the long run. Microfiber cloth is the best material to use when wiping grime, dirt, and other substances off the lenses, as they are designed to do so with great care and efficiency.\\n\\xa0\\nHandle With Care\\n\\xa0\\nWhen performing maintenance and cleaning on your specs, remember to properly handle them. Take them off by holding both sides, and don’t pull them off by using one hand, as this is one of the most common causes of joint snapping for older eyeglasses. Avoid holding them by one of their frame arms, as it can bend your eyeglasses at an awkward angle and can cause fitting issues. If you’re gonna wipe the lenses, hold your eyeglasses by the bridge (the part that goes over your nose) and gently wipe the lenses in a circular motion. If taking care of eyeglasses feels like a hassle for you, you can try having\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0prescribed to you instead.\\n\\xa0\\nCleaning Solutions\\n\\xa0\\nUsing strong chemical cleaning solutions on the surface of your lenses is not a good idea, as most household cleaning fluids contain ammonia or some other form of strong acids. These can destroy and erode the protective coating over the lenses, and leave minuscule amounts of the chemical on the surface of the lenses that are facing inwards toward your eyes, which can cause irritation and discomfort, or worse, dry eye.\\n\\xa0\\nContact Us!\\n\\xa0\\nNeed a reliable\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0for your annual checkups?

Let’s explore the pros and cons of glasses and contacts to help you make the best choice for your eyes and lifestyle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvantages of Contact Lenses\\nContact lenses offer a clear, natural field of view without any obstructions or distortions at the edge of your vision. For those concerned with their appearance, contact lenses won’t block your face or alter your appearance, although some can change your eye color. For athletes and those leading an active lifestyle, contact lenses are the way to go as these are less likely to be dislodged. The range of options available is vast. You can choose daily disposables, weeklies or even monthlies based on your comfort level and lifestyle.\\nBefore making your decision, schedule a comprehensive eye exam to identify any specific concerns or determine whether you need to work with a\\xa0scleral optometrist.\\nDisadvantages of Contact Lenses\\nOn the flip side, contact lenses require maintenance. They need to be properly cleaned and stored, which can be time-consuming. Some people may even feel discomfort or irritation, especially if they have sensitive eyes.\\nDry eyes can be a common issue for people considering the switch.\\xa0Dry eye treatment\\xa0is available and can greatly ease the transition to contact lenses. You may also want to consider a trial period with contacts before you fully commit to the switch.\\nThe risk of eye infections also increases as contacts are directly worn on the eye. On top of that, the recurring expenses for contact lenses and care products can add up, making them an expensive choice in the long run.\\nMake the Switch With Lumen Optometric\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to discuss your options—whether you are switching to contact lenses from eyeglasses or need a\\xa0Neurolens treatment.

Eyesight only refers to the ability a person has to see clearly without any corrective lenses, which varies from person to person and can change over time. Meanwhile, vision is the ability to process what a person sees and it can be improved with practice. Lumen Optometric, the eye center to trust for neurolens treatment, gives more insight on how they differ from each other.\\n\\n\\nEyesight\\xa0\\nThis is something that takes place in the eye. Light enters through the front of the eye and then an image is created on the retina. If the eye is not perfectly shaped, the image may not focus perfectly on the retina. When this happens, some may wear glasses or contact lenses in order to improve eyesight or clarity of what they see, or in some cases, wear special lenses prescribed by their trusted\\xa0scleral optometrist. The image of what they see in their eyesight is then transferred to the brain where vision takes place.\\nVision\\xa0\\nThis takes place in the brain. The brain receives a clear image and then the vision is the process of understanding and analyzing the image. The brain automatically filters the information and determines what information is important and ignores the rest of the information. Vision can be both consciously or subconsciously processed and is affected not only by information coming in but also by what we expect to see due to prior knowledge.\\nHow Do They Work Together?\\nLet’s say a child is presented with a picture of a cow. Eyesight is used to see the image clearly, while vision processes what they see and recognizes what the image is. When an eye doctor tells the child that they have 20/20 vision, they’re really saying that their eyesight is fine. While this means the child can see clearly, vision still refers to recognizing the image and whether both their eyes work together to process what they see. So, if the child has never seen a cow before, their vision won’t be able to recognize what the image is.\\nWhen you need a trusted specialist on\\xa0dry eye treatment, Lumen Optometric is the name you can count on.

Even children with low levels of myopia have a greater risk of glaucoma and retinal detachment compared to their non-myopic counterparts.\\n\\n\\nThe good news is that slowing down the progression of myopia can drastically lower the risks of developing eye disease later in life. Innovative products like MiSight 1-day contact lenses help ensure a healthier future for myopic children.\\nAs part of the Treehouse Eyes network, we are proud to be one of the first practices in the country to be certified to fit MiSight 1-day contact lenses for myopia treatment, and be part of the Brilliant Futures Myopia Management Program.\\nCooperVision, which manufactures MiSight 1-day lenses, calls Brilliant Futures “the new standard of care” for children with myopia. “It provides inclusive practice, child and parent support to create the optimal environment for compliance, satisfaction, clinical outcomes and long-term loyalty, all via a comprehensive management program featuring MiSight 1-day daily disposable contact lenses.”\\nWhat are MiSight 1-Day Contact Lenses?\\nMiSight 1-day contact lenses are soft lenses that are worn daily and disposed of after each use. A fresh pair of contacts are placed into the eyes every morning to provide the child with crisp and clear vision while also slowing the eye’s elongation — the source of progressive myopia. These contacts are safe and easy for children to use since they require almost no maintenance.\\nFour different clinical trials were conducted to study the safety and effectiveness of MiSight lenses over a 3-year span; 135 children between the ages of 8-12 participated in the trials. Those who wore MiSight contacts experienced considerably less myopia progression than those who wore conventional soft contact lenses.\\nMiSight 1-Day Contact Lenses: A Popular Choice\\nCooperVision recently partnered with Sarah Michelle Gellar, a well-known American actress, entrepreneur and producer, to help spread awareness about the importance of myopia management and annual eye exams for myopic children.\\nThe need for myopia management hit home for Gellar, who is myopic herself and has a child with myopia. “My husband and I are both nearsighted and our myopia has continued to worsen over time. We want our kids to have a chance for better vision and lower their risk for future eye health issues” explains Gellar.\\nWhile regular eyeglasses or contacts help children see a whiteboard or tennis ball, “MiSight 1- day lenses offer children the benefits of clear vision while slowing myopia progression during their growing years. That is why I am thrilled to be partnering with CooperVision on this campaign,” Gellar says.\\nMoreover, many parents are pleased to learn that MiSight 1-day contact lenses are FDA approved. In November 2019, the lenses received FDA approval to slow myopia progression in children who are 8-12 years old at the time of their first fitting — making MiSight 1-day contact lenses the only FDA approved soft contact lenses for myopia management!\\nWe Are Proud to Be Part of the Myopia Management Movement\\nIn addition to MiSight, our highly trained and experienced doctors can offer other treatment options to manage childhood myopia, including specialized overnight-wear contact lenses and prescription eye drops.\\nContact us today to make an appointment for a myopia consultation for your child. We’ll evaluate your child’s eyes and vision and recommend a personalized treatment plan that will work best for your child and your family.\\nLet us help ensure a clear and bright future for your child!\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Primary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

GMAC, of which Treehouse Eyes is a member, invited junior racers to the go-kart track for an unexpected eye exam before heading out for some fun!\\n\\n\\nA recent survey of parents by the Global Myopia Awareness Coalition found \\u200b\\u200b”… half of the parents reported their children spent more than four hours using electronic devices each day during the pandemic, compared to 18% of parents reporting the same behavior prior to the pandemic.”\\nMost children don’t notice anything is wrong with their vision until it starts to really impact their activities. Eye screenings done by a pediatrician are important, but they don’t always pick up on myopia, especially at lower levels. This is why GMAC decided it was more important than ever to raise awareness of myopia and the treatments available. Watch the “Little Kid License” video now:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the same survey mentioned above, GMAC discovered that “… more than 70% of parents believe their pediatrician will flag any issues related to their children’s eyesight and, almost the same amount trust that their child would say something if they had vision issues.” Unfortunately, this is often not the case.\\nBut, why is this such an important problem to face? Myopia develops rapidly as children grow. Remember, your child’s eye grows like any other part of their body as they age. Since children are prone to growth spurts, naturally their eyes are as well. Myopia occurs when a child’s eyes grow too fast, leading to blurry distance vision and greater risk for eye diseases later in life.\\nWe know the start of the school year is insanely busy with back-to-school activities along with the everyday obligations of work and life, but it’s now more important than ever to find a provider that understands how to diagnose and treat your child’s myopia.\\nGive your child the tools they need to succeed! To schedule your child’s back-to-school eye exam, visit\\xa0book an appointment or to see a list of all providers near you visit Treehouse Eyes today.\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Primary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

October is Halloween Eye Safety Month and below we have some helpful tips on how to make sure your child’s Halloween costume doesn’t leave complications for your kids vision.\\n\\n1. Get an eye exam.\\nDon’t be haunted by an eye infection. If you’d like to obtain decorative lenses for a Halloween costume, make sure to get an eye exam so your eye doctor can give the proper prescription and provide you with information about the proper contact lens cleaning and care.\\n2. Get A Prescription For Decorative Lenses\\nThe CDC and the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend not to purchase decorative contact lenses from costume shops, online stores, beauty salons, drug stores, flea markets, or anywhere that doesn’t require a prescription. Make sure to see a doctor to get lenses properly fitted, so your child isn’t at risk for vision problems such as eye infections and eye sores which can lead to permanent vision loss. Learn more about decorative lenses here.\\n3. Be Mindful Of Makeup Use\\nHalloween makeup can be a fun way to enhance any costume, but it’s essential to not share makeup for the risk of eye infection. Practice good hygiene by taking off all makeup before bed and avoid using old, expired makeup. For eyelash extensions, it’s important to test for lash glue allergies and practice proper hygiene during application. See more about Halloween makeup safety.\\n4. Have Fun!\\nNow that you’ve gotten your eye exam and your costume is complete, it’s time to go out and have fun. Enjoy your night knowing your child’s eyes will look ‘cool’ and won’t cause any long-lasting effects after the fun is over.\\nSpread Awareness and Enjoy Spooky Season!\\nMake Halloween as memorable as possible for your child and spread the word to other parents about the importance of children’s eye health. If you are worried that your child might have myopia, often referred to as nearsightedness, head over to Treehouse Eyes where our doctors develop customized treatment plans for your child.\\nOur treatment includes daytime and overnight contact lenses and special prescription eye drops. You will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor.

Fortunately, you’re not stuck wearing such lenses, thanks to high-index lenses. In today’s post, your local\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0at Lumen Optometric shares a look at high-index lenses.\\n\\n\\nRegular Lenses\\nPeople suffering from refractive errors — nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism — choose to wear eyeglasses to correct their vision: it’s easier to wear than contact lenses, not as invasive or costly as an eye operation, and it can be fashionable. Eyeglasses correct refractive errors by compensating for factors such as eye length and the curvature of the cornea and lens, providing good vision.\\nSometimes a person’s vision may require strong eyeglass prescriptions that require thicker lenses. Most eyeglass wearers are nearsighted, which requires lenses that are thinner at the center than at the edges. The stronger the prescription, the thicker the edges will be, which can result in heavy lenses. This can limit one’s options in terms of eyewear selection, as one may need to stick to thicker frames to hold their lenses. Wearing\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0might not be an option for some people.\\nHigh-Index Lenses\\nMany of today’s eye care centers offer high-index lenses as an option. They provide the same level of refractive correction as regular lenses but are much thinner. High-index lenses offer the following benefits:\\nThinner and lighter\\xa0— High-index lenses have thinner edges even at high power, which opens up a wider selection of frame styles for you. Lighter lenses also make it easy to wear, even for prolonged periods.\\nAesthetically pleasing\\xa0— One reason why some people dislike wearing glasses is that high-power lenses tend to look like the bottom of a soda bottle, colloquially called “Coke bottle glasses,” which makes the eyes look smaller (for nearsighted prescriptions) or larger (for farsighted prescriptions). High-index lenses are “aspheric,” — that is, less rounded — than regular lenses, which means even high-power lenses won’t distort your facial features.\\nLumen Optometric is your leading provider of eye care services, including\\xa0corneal reshaping.

Moreover, many young kids aren’t aware they have issues with their vision or don’t complain of symptoms. That’s why regular appointments with your local eye doctor matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA local\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0shares how poor vision can affect children’s learning.\\nDifficulty Focusing\\nMyopia or nearsightedness is a common refractive error in children. Individuals with this eye condition can find it difficult to see distant objects. If your child is nearsighted, they might struggle to see the text on the board, which can cause them to lose focus. Their grades could suffer when they can’t concentrate on and understand their teacher’s instructions.\\nIf you’ve noticed that your child keeps squinting or holding reading materials too closely to their face, schedule a visit with your eye doctor immediately. Only eye specialists can confirm if they are nearsighted and require prescription glasses. At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to assist with your family’s eye care needs. Aside from contact lenses\\xa0and glasses, we offer\\xa0dry eye treatment.\\nPoor Reading Comprehension\\nVision issues can impact a child’s reading comprehension skills. The eyes must work harmoniously to move across the page, recognize letters and understand the text. It isn’t uncommon for children with vision-related learning problems to get confused with similar-looking letters, shapes and words because they can’t see the figures properly.\\nCompromised Hand-Eye Coordination\\nSeveral studies have shown that exercise during school days can improve academic performance. If your little one doesn’t like playing outside with other kids or tends to shy away from activities that require distant vision, there’s a chance that they have problems with their sight.

They can give you a more natural look than eyeglasses and are generally safe to wear as long as you care for them properly. Many first-time wearers tend to find it challenging to put in and remove their contacts.\\n\\n\\nPut in and take out your contacts easily using these helpful tips.\\xa0\\nHow to Put in Your Contacts\\nBefore handling your contacts, wash and dry your hands. Failing to do so heightens the risk of eye infections and corneal ulcers from bacteria exposure. Wash your hands using soap and warm water to ensure they are clean. Moreover, avoid drying your hands with cloths or towels with lint.\\xa0\\nGo in front of a mirror and stand on a flat surface. If there’s a sink below you, make sure to plug the drain. To avoid confusion, make it a habit to put in the same lens first. Place your contacts on the tip of your index or middle finger of your dominant hand. Inspect your lenses for scratches or damaged areas. If your lens forms a blow and the edges turn up, it means it’s in the correct position.\\xa0\\nHold your upper lid open with your non-dominant hand while in front of a mirror, and hold down your lower lid with the ring finger of your dominant hand. It’s now time to put the lens in your eye, which you should do while looking at the ceiling. To allow your lens to get in place, shut your eyes and roll them in a circular motion. Open your eyes and blink a couple of times. Check your eyes in the mirror to see if the contacts are in the center of your eyes.\\xa0\\nYou’ll know your lenses are in the right position if you’re comfortable and seeing clearly. If not, take out the lenses and reinsert them. Repeat the same procedure to your other eye once you’ve successfully put in the first lens.\\xa0\\nHow to Take Them Out\\nAgain, make sure your hands are clean and dry before touching your contacts. Remove any leftover contact lens solution from the case and allow them to dry or dry with a clean cloth. Get in front of a mirror and gaze up. Pull your lower lid down using the middle finger of your dominant hand. It helps to take off the same lens first to save yourself from confusion.\\xa0\\nGently push the lens down to the white of your eye using the index finger of your dominant hand. Carefully pinch the lens with your index finger’s pads and thumb to take it off your eye. Do the same procedure to remove the lens from your other eye.\\xa0\\nNeed to upgrade your contact lens prescription? Lumen Optometric has options for different vision correction needs.

However, too much of it can harm various parts of your body, including your eyes. It can also affect your current and future eye health and vision.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nContinue reading to learn how alcohol affects your eyes and vision from a local\\xa0scleral optometrist.\\xa0\\nWhat Does Alcohol Do to Your Eyes?\\nModerate drinkers should expect the effects of alcohol to wear off after a while, especially if they take proper care of their bodies after drinking. After going out for drinks with your friends, make sure to drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated. It’s also important to get sufficient rest and sleep.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, heavy drinkers are at risk of vision changes and even permanent eye damage. If you drink a lot in a single day, you may experience dizziness and blurry vision. Making heavy drinking a habit is never a good idea because there is a close correlation between the liver and the eyes. Every organ in your body is related, a reason why you should focus on your holistic health. It’s essential to get regular health checks and eye exams to keep track of your overall health. At Lumen Optometric, we offer comprehensive eye exams and\\xa0dry eye treatment.\\xa0\\nExcessive Drinking and Your Vision\\nOver time, drinking too much alcohol can cause brain damage. If your brain does not function properly, your vision may also suffer. You may have permanently blurred vision or double vision due to the weakening of eye muscles. When this happens, your reaction time may also decrease.\\xa0\\nExcessive drinking also compromises your peripheral vision and causes you to develop tunnel vision. This condition can make driving difficult because your eyes can’t react well to headlights. Another thing that alcohol can damage is your ability to distinguish contrast in colors. Moreover, too much drinking may also result in optic neuropathy, migraines, and rapid eye movements.\\xa0\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we’re more than happy to assist with your eye care needs. We offer a wide range of services, including myopia management, orthokeratology, and\\xa0neurolens treatment.

Women are particularly vulnerable to cataracts due to hormonal changes. As of writing this article, the only treatment for cataracts is surgery. During cataract surgery, the doctor will remove the cloudy lens and replace them with an intraocular lens or IOL.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe exact cause of cataracts may be unknown, but many experts believe that oxidative stress can damage enzymes and proteins in the eye’s natural lens. As such, the best way to reduce cataract risks is to eat a healthy diet that consists of antioxidant chemicals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Lumen Optometric, a top provider of\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0services, recommends adding these foods to your everyday menu.\\xa0\\nFruits and Vegetables\\nAccording to research, you need five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day for optimal eye health. Choose organic fruits and vegetables. When eating them as is or adding them as an ingredient for meals, leave the skins on, as they are full of vitamins A, C, and E as well as lutein and zeaxanthin. Fruits and vegetables offer the highest total antioxidant capacity, so be sure to include them in your regular meals.\\nFish\\nAnother way to reduce the risk of cataracts is by eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. This includes seafood such as shrimp, tuna, salmon, and trout. If your\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0tells you that you are at risk for cataract development, you can slow the progression by eating fish at least twice each week. This way, you nourish your eyes and protect your vision.\\xa0\\nWhole Grains\\nHaving three servings of 100% whole grains daily is a great way to prevent cataracts. This may include amaranth, quinoa, sorghum, or millet. While these grains seem unfamiliar to you, research some recipes and add something new to your diet. In addition to that, you should also read food labels carefully. Avoid white bread and bakery items that may contain refined grains and sugars and select minimally processed items.\\xa0\\nNuts and Seeds\\nVitamin E is an antioxidant that protects membranes of eye cells from radical damage. A few foods, including cooking oils, seeds and nuts, are exceptionally rich sources.\\xa0\\nPreserve the health of your eyes with the help of Lumen Optometric. In addition to comprehensive eye exams, we also provide prescription glasses and\\xa0contact lenses.

In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses how often you should have your eye prescription updated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Often Should You Update Your Eye Prescription?\\nPeople have different eye care needs. Some need to have their eye prescription changed annually, while others won’t need to update theirs every three years. If you’ve been keeping up with routine appointments with your eye doctor, you’d already have an idea of how often you should update your eye prescription.\\nSome factors affect how often a person should see their\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0and have their prescription updated. For many people, age and genetics are two such factors: if you have a family member who needs to update their prescription regularly, chances are you’ll be needing the same. Lifestyle is also another factor. For example, if you have a job that requires constantly facing a screen, eye strain can affect your vision over the long term.\\nSigns That You Need to Update Your Eye Prescription\\nRegular visits to your eye doctor can help determine how often you should update your prescription. The pandemic has made it difficult for people to see their eye doctor, but if you haven’t had an eye exam even before the quarantines began, then you should see one as soon as possible — even more so if you’re experiencing one or more of the following:\\n\\n\\nYou’re having frequent headaches.\\xa0Pain behind or around the eyes is a warning sign that your brain is trying to compensate for the change in your vision. While resting your eyes and taking pain medication can provide temporary relief, updating your eye prescription is a better long-term solution.\\n\\n\\nYou’re often squinting.\\xa0Squinting can help focus your vision and bring clarity. However, you shouldn’t have to — not with an updated eye prescription.\\n\\n\\nYou’re having trouble reading signs from a distance.\\xa0If your daily routine includes tasks that depend on clear vision such as driving, then an outdated prescription may put you at risk.\\n\\n\\nLumen Optometric provides eye care services, including\\xa0corneal reshaping, to clients in Sierra Madre, CA, and the surrounding communities in Los Angeles County.

They occur when the shape of your eye prevents light from focusing correctly on your retina, or the light-sensitive tissue layer found in the back of your eye. More than five million Americans suffer from refractive errors, impacting their quality of life. But the good news is that this vision problem can be corrected. The premier optometrist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares a quick overview of different refractive error types and their treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n1. Myopia.\\xa0Also called ‘nearsightedness’, this particular refractive error makes it hard for people to see far-away objects. Myopia happens when the eye is too long in the back, or when there’s a problem with the shape of the cornea (the clear front layer of the eyes) or the lens (the inner part of the eye that helps with focusing).\\n2. Hyperopia.\\xa0To those with hyperopia, or ‘farsightedness”, nearby objects will appear blurry. This refractive error happens when the eyeball grows too short from front to back, or when the cornea or lens has a different shape than normal. Unlike those who suffer from myopia, which may develop in patients between the ages of 6 and 14, people with hyperopia are usually born with this vision problem.\\n3. Astigmatism.\\xa0When a person has astigmatism, they’ll have trouble seeing both far-away and nearby objects clearly. This is caused by a differently-shaped cornea or lens, which makes light bend differently as it enters the eye.\\n4. Presbyopia.\\xa0This type of refractive error affects middle-aged and older adults. Presbyopia is an age-related vision problem that makes it hard for people to see things up close because the eye lenses have become harder and less flexible, preventing light from focusing properly on the retina.\\nHow Refractive Errors are Treated\\nBefore a refractive error can be corrected, it has to be diagnosed accurately during a comprehensive eye exam performed by a trusted eye care professional like Lumen Optometric. Once the vision problem is diagnosed, it may be corrected using prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Myopia and hyperopia may also be fixed without the benefit of eyeglasses or contacts through orthokeratology. This safe, FDA-approved and non-surgical treatment involves the use of custom lenses that gently reshape the eyes as you sleep. Ask us more about this particular solution and determine whether this will be a viable option for you.\\nSafe and Worry-Free Eye Care Services in the Sierra Madre\\nAchieving clear and healthy vision can be easy – you just need to turn to a premier eye doctor like Lumen Optometric to handle your vision correction needs. Call us today at (626) 921-0199, or fill out this convenient\\xa0form\\xa0to schedule your appointment.

Whether you have a normal eye condition or you have existing eye conditions or a risk for certain eye conditions, the following tips from\\xa0Neurolens treatment\\xa0specialist Lumen Optometric will surely help give you peace of mind whenever you need to drive in the evening:\\n\\n\\nNight Driving Glasses\\nIf you’re having difficulty driving at night, you can ask your eye care specialist to prescribe special night driving glasses that can help you see better on the road. This type of glasses usually has a yellow tint and anti-reflective coating. Also, lenses made with wavefront diagnostic technology can reduce glare, halos, starbursts and other aberrations that can distract your vision.\\nRegular Eye Checkup\\nMake sure to have your eyes checked by a specialist at least once every two years. If you have a significant eye condition or you have trouble with your eyes or vision, you may have to visit your eye doctor more frequently. Don’t hesitate to go for a checkup if you experience vision problems on the road at night. Your doctor may recommend that you take specialized testing, such as an evaluation of your visual field or contrast sensitivity, to determine what’s wrong and what can be done to improve your condition. Also, don’t neglect any treatments prescribed to you. If you need\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0or treatment of an eye disease, make sure to follow your doctor’s instructions.\\nOther Tips\\nBelow are other simple ways to help ensure your safety while driving at night:\\nAlways keep your car windows clear so that you can have a good view of the road.Do not drive if you are tired or stressed. Driving requires focus. If you are already exhausted or dealing with several distractions, it would be better to have someone else drive instead.Plan your trips, especially if you will be going on a long drive. As much as possible, stick to roads that you are familiar with and avoid dark, unlighted streets and risky spots.\\nLumen Optometric provides quality eye care services and products that meet various needs.

It does not only strengthen and improve one’s physical abilities; it can also help boost a person’s mental sharpness, emotional health, and social skills. But due to the nature of various kinds of sports, risks of injuries are always present. One example of this is the risk of eye injury.\\n\\n\\nThat said, it is important to have the right gear and protective eyewear to keep your eyes safe. This is true for anyone, whether you are wearing glasses or\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0or not. By wearing the right eye protection, you can save yourself from eye injuries such as corneal abrasion, detached retina, eye socket fracture, and hyphema.\\nPolycarbonate lenses are usually recommended for protective sports eyewear because they are impact-resistant and shatterproof. They are also thinner and lighter than plastic and provide UV protection. Make sure that the polycarbonate lenses that you use meet or exceed the current sport-specific ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International standards.\\nIn this post,\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0expert Lumen Optometric shares tips on how you can protect your eyes when playing different sports.\\nBaseball and Softball\\nUse helmet-mounted faceguards that are approved by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE). Eye guards like goggles or spectacles are also recommended to minimize injury in case of a ball impact. Sports eye guards should be approved to ASTM F803-19 or the most current standard.\\nFootball\\nUse a faceguard with a polycarbonate visor shield.

Get a travel pouch that fits your contacts, solution, gels, etc. Do not forget to pack eye drops that can alleviate itchiness during the hayfever season or dryness caused by heavy air conditioning.\\nConsider Switching to Disposable Contacts\\nSometimes, using weekly or even monthly contact lenses does not make it easy to live your active lifestyle, especially if preparing travel kits is not your thing. If this is the case, bring up the idea of switching to contact lenses that you can dispose of daily with your optician. However, this might not be a fitting option if you use scleral or other specialty lenses, says a\\xa0scleral optometrist.\\nBring Your Sunglasses\\nOverexposure to ultraviolet rays can lead to a host of eye-related issues like cataracts or corneal sunburn, so it is important to take the right precautions to safeguard your vision from damage. Having a pair of sunglasses with you during travels is just as essential as having all your eye care accessories. Sure, contact lenses do provide protection against UVA and UVB, but unlike sunglasses, they do not fully cover your eyes including the skin on your lids.\\nLumen Optometric is a premier eye care center specializing in contacts and eyeglasses,\\xa0neurolens treatment, dry eye treatment, myopia control and more.

In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses what causes dry eye syndrome, and how you can manage it if it happens to you.\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Dry Eye Syndrome?\\nDry eye syndrome is characterized by dryness around the eyes, which may be accompanied by irritation, inflammation, or blurred vision. Anyone can experience these symptoms, however, discomfort is more pronounced for people who wear contact lenses, as lack of moisture increases friction between the eyes and the lenses.\\nDryness is usually caused by hormone changes, some autoimmune conditions, or damage to the tear glands or the skin around the eyes. Advanced age and certain types of allergies may also contribute to dry eye syndrome. Some types of contact lenses, when worn for long periods, can also cause dryness in the eyes.\\nManaging Dry Eye Syndrome\\nIf you’re experiencing symptoms of dry eye syndrome, do not take any medication or try how-tos that you may find online. Visit an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0to determine its cause and plan treatment. One of the most common treatments for dry eye syndrome is taking lubricating eye drops, which are often prescribed for dryness caused by inefficient tear glands or very low humidity levels. If dryness is determined to be caused by the medication that you’re taking, your eye doctor may require changes to your prescription.\\nChoose the Right Contact Lenses\\nIf dryness occurs when you wear your contact lenses, you don’t have to limit its usage or switch to eyeglasses if you’re not comfortable wearing one. The following are other types of contact lenses that are more suitable for people suffering from dry eye syndrome:\\nSoft Contact Lenses\\xa0— These contacts are made of hydrogel, which contains water. Soft contact lenses are typically disposable, however, some manufacturers offer extended-wear options that are reusable for up to 30 days.\\nSilicone-Based Hydrogel Contact Lenses\\xa0— These are functionally similar to hydrogel-based contact lenses, but have better moisture retention.\\nGas-Permeable Contact Lenses\\xa0— These contacts are relatively more rigid, but they let oxygen reach the eye. Orthokeratology contact lenses are made from a similar material.\\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of dry eye syndrome, call Lumen Optometric at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our\\xa0contact form\\xa0to schedule an appointment. We also offer\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0and other eye care services.\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Tagged With: eye doctor, eye expert, eye maintenancePrimary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

However, by making a few lifestyle changes, you can lower your risk for these conditions. This Healthy Aging Month, Lumen Optometric, your trusted\\xa0eye exam doctor, shares tips on taking care of your aging eyes.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEat a Balanced Diet\\xa0\\nMake sure to include in your diet foods rich in eye-friendly nutrients, such as Vitamin A (which helps protect the cornea, the surface of your eye) and Vitamin E (which prevent free radicals from damaging proteins in your eyes).\\xa0\\nShould You Take Supplements?\\xa0\\nSupplements can help prevent vitamin deficiencies, but they’re not a substitute for a balanced diet. If you’re considering taking supplements, consult your eye doctor.\\xa0\\nUndergo Routine Eye Exams\\xa0\\nHow often should you have your eyes checked? As a general rule, those aged 40 and above should see their eye doctor at least once a year. What many patients don’t realize is that they don’t usually notice that their vision has deteriorated unless the change is abrupt or significant. That’s because your brain automatically adapts to any changes in your vision, sometimes tricking you into thinking there’s nothing wrong with your vision even though it has already deteriorated. Through routine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect changes in your vision before they significantly affect your lifestyle and prescribe treatment. For instance, they might give you a higher prescription for your\\xa0contact lenses.\\xa0\\nWear Sunglasses\\xa0\\nProlonged exposure to ultraviolet rays can damage your vision and increase your risk for conditions such as cataracts or macular degeneration. To protect your eyes from UV damage, always wear sunglasses while you’re outside. In particular, we recommend wearing sunglasses with a shade of UV 400, which provide nearly 100% protection from UV rays.\\xa0\\nLumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including eye examination and\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0services.

Balance Indoor and Outdoor Time\\nOutdoor play offers numerous benefits, but many children aren’t getting enough of it. Most children spend much of their time indoors, whether in a classroom, at home, or in after-school activities.\\nKids who regularly play outdoors have improved motor skills, feel more independent, and practice important social skills.\\nBut the main benefit of “outdoor time” that eye doctors like to focus on is the lower incidence of myopia (where distant objects appear blurry). Numerous studies published in journals like Ophthalmic Research and Review Of Optometry have shown that children who spend 1.5-2.5 hours per day outdoors during the daytime have a reduced risk of becoming myopic or, if they have myopia, it progresses at a slower pace.\\nSending your kids outside to play every day will help their vision, overall health, and contribute to academic success.\\n2. Encourage Your Child To Take Frequent Breaks\\nOnce the new school year begins, students are often busy with daily homework, reading assignments, and visually demanding recreational activities like video games.\\nWhile all of these activities are important, they shouldn’t be done without periodic breathers.\\nEye strain is a real concern for the many students who spend hours in front of a book or screen and can put a damper on their grades.\\nMinimally, have your child follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes they should focus for 20 seconds on an object that’s at least 20 feet away.\\nEven better, encourage slightly longer breaks for a snack in the sun, or a quick walk around the block to allow their eyes to focus on more distant objects.\\n3. Have Their Eyes Examined by an Optometrist\\nWhether or not your child wears glasses, yearly eye exams will help ensure healthy visual development.\\nIt’s no surprise that children who don’t see well perform at a lower level than their peers. In some cases, young children aren’t even aware that their vision has changed, or they may not be able to verbally express it.\\nAt our practice, our eye exams go far beyond the standard vision screenings offered in school. We thoroughly check your child’s eye health and several visual skills, including visual acuity, focusing, tracking and teaming.\\nIf your child has myopia we will discuss if they are a candidate for myopia management. Myopia management treatments can slow or stop myopia in children and teens and doing so will minimize their risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life.\\n4. Filter Out Blue Light\\nNow, more than ever, children’s eyes are focusing on screens of all shapes and sizes. While science hasn’t yet confirmed the damaging effects of blue light on a child’s eyes, one thing is certain: blue light exposure (especially in the evening) can lead to reduced sleep quality.\\nGood-quality sleep is crucial for cognitive and physical development, which is why many parents purchase blue light glasses or utilize blue light filters such as screens and software on devices. Blue light also contributes to digital eye strain, leading to symptoms like eye pain, headaches, blurred vision and dry eyes. If your child uses a tablet, smartphone, or computer before bedtime, speak with us about whether blue light glasses or lens coatings can help.\\nGive your child the tools they need to succeed!

Interestingly, around half of the individuals with this eye problem aren’t even aware of it. This condition often shows no symptoms in its initial stages. It’s frequently called “sneak of the sight” because when not detected and treated early, it can cause irreversible vision loss.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn if glaucoma is preventable from your local\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0specialist.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat Is Glaucoma?\\nGlaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve or the nerve in the back of the eye. Its symptoms are usually not noticeable in its early stages. People often only notice changes in their vision once the condition has progressed. The only way to confirm if you have glaucoma is to get a comprehensive eye exam. While it has no cure, early treatment can help preserve your sight.\\xa0\\n\\nWho Are at Risk?\\nYou can get glaucoma, regardless of your ethnicity and age. However, it’s more common in people over 60, African Americans over 60, and those with a family history of glaucoma. If you are at high risk of this eye condition, you might need to see your\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0every one to two years.\\xa0\\n\\nIs It Preventable?\\nWhile glaucoma isn’t preventable, it can be caught early through regular eye exams. Early detection and treatment go a long way in preventing significant or permanent vision loss. Eating nourishing meals has also been proven to be beneficial to eye health. Include leafy greens, colored fruits, berries and vegetables in your diet.\\xa0\\n\\nRegular exercise can lower eye pressure, which is helpful for people with glaucoma. Even low-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is ideal for glaucoma patients. Quitting smoking and wearing UV-blocking sunglasses are other ways to protect your eyes from the effects of this vision-threatening eye condition.\\xa0\\n\\nIf you experience sudden vision changes, don’t wait long to schedule an eye exam. At Lumen Optometric, we provide more than prescription eyeglasses and\\xa0contact lenses.\\xa0We also specialize in myopia management and orthokeratology.

For contact lens wearers, the “new normal” has put a question on their use of contacts. While contact lenses are generally a safe and effective form of vision correction for many people, concerns have grown as to whether it’s OK to continue using these lenses or not amid the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince contact lenses are inserted and removed using one’s fingers, wouldn’t this pose a higher risk of coronavirus infection? According to recent research, there is no sufficient evidence suggesting that contact lens wearers have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Experts have also emphasized the importance of proper handwashing and good hygiene in order to prevent or reduce such risks.\\nLumen Optometric, a trusted expert in eye care and\\xa0dry eye treatment, shares more tips below.\\nObserve Proper Handwashing\\nBefore handling your contact lenses, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Afterwards, dry your hands with a clean towel or unused paper towels. If soap and water are not available, you can use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% of alcohol.\\nRegularly Disinfect Contact Lenses\\nYour\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0will also likely advise you to regularly disinfect your contacts if they are monthly or two-week lenses. Make sure to follow the cleaning instructions of the manufacturer or your eye doctor. If you have disposable lenses, get rid of them properly every after use.\\nDiscontinue Wearing Contacts and Switch to Glasses if Sick\\nIf you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms or you have tested positive for COVID-19, it would be best to stop using your contacts and switch to glasses for the meantime. Take note, however, that wearing glasses cannot protect you against COVID-19 or prevent transmissions of the virus.\\nLumen Optometric is a local practice that offers top-notch eye care services. From eye exams to\\xa0Neurolens treatment, we can ensure a personalized approach to your eye concerns.

A myopic eye is one that grows too long front to back. We know this because we measure it using special equipment that calculates the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length, and with advanced equipment we can now measure this down to fractions of a millimeter. So myopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye – if a normal eye is shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye would more resemble a football.\\nPortrait of boy working on team project in art class\\nOnce an eye is too long, there are currently no known treatments or cures which can cause the axial length of the eye to reverse. Refractive surgery performed on adults, such as LASIK, does not “shrink” the eye, but rather reshapes the front surface of the cornea to enable clear vision without corrective lenses. While the patient who has successful refractive surgery can now see clearly, they still have an elongated eye, so still have the risks associated with the disease.\\nThe Dangers of Having Myopia\\nThere are different types of myopia as well. If a child develops myopia at a young age, we know that they are at higher risk to develop high myopia and even pathological levels of myopia. High levels of myopia can lead to an increased risk for diseases of the eye such as retinal detachments, glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy. Unfortunately, those diseases can all lead to permanent vision loss. These life-altering diseases are another layer of danger besides the obvious need for optical correction in glasses or contact lenses in order to see clearly.\\nWhen you have pathological or degenerative myopia, other signs can form on your eyes that your eye doctor needs to monitor over time. Lattice degeneration and lacquer cracks of the retina all show signs that the retina is under duress because the eyeball has grown excessively long. Ask your doctor about these signs and other ones such as a tilted optic nerve head disc and choroidal neovascularization that happen exponentially higher in cases of extremely high levels of myopia.\\nWhat are the Best Ways to Treat Myopia?\\nThe best treatment is to first prevent myopia if possible. More research is being conducted in this area, but as a general rule, eye doctors are encouraging at least two hours of outdoor activity per day. More outdoor activities under natural sunlight have been associated with a lower risk of developing myopia in the first place. If your children have to do intense studying or reading, it is recommended to do as much reading as possible when the sun has set versus reading during the day.\\nRegular checkups with your eye doctor to diagnose myopia as early as possible are also critical. By catching myopia at an early age, there can be many different types of interventions to prevent myopia from worsening. Myopia typically begins in school-aged children and can worsen until the leveling out usually in your mid-twenties.\\nAs far as the visual component is concerned, usually, a pair of glasses or contact lenses are sufficient. Once the eyes have stopped growing, refractive surgery procedures can be employed as well. But keep in mind that simply correcting your vision will not stop your eyes from getting worse. The root cause of myopia, an eyeball that continues to grow excessively long during our youth, needs to be addressed.\\nSpecial pharmaceutical agents such as atropine have been shown to slow down the progression of myopia considerably. Special contacts such as orthokeratology lenses worn at night are effective as well. Even soft contact lenses and glasses designed with special optics different from the traditional pair of glasses can be effective to slow down the rate of myopic progression.\\nCustom Orthokeratology or Overnight Contact Lenses\\nOrthokeratology involves using a specially designed contact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while sleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names for orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping system, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the curvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina.\\nWhile initially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see more clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in reducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused in front\\nof the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the optical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact lenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning and disinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper hygiene ‘ortho-k’ is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating children of almost any age.\\nAtropine\\nAtropine is a pharmaceutical agent that can be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to treat children with amblyopia, sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic progression.\\nCustom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses\\nMore contact lenses are being designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight contact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia by almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers throughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral retina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact lens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia as well as prevent the eye from growing too long.\\nSpecial Myopia Treating Eyeglasses\\nMore glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a similar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is a particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact lenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s bodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of power in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial length elongation.\\nTreehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression\\nThe good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids—just like yours—so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above are four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been\\ndiagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with a contact lens while sleeping. Atropine involves an eye drop that can signal the eye to grow a little slower. Custom soft multifocal lenses are worn during the day. And even specially designed glasses are on the horizon to improve the progression of myopia.\\nThe Treehouse Eyes eye doctors use state-of-the-art equipment to develop a personalized treatment plan for your child.

If you feel that there is something wrong with your vision or experiencing discomfort in your eyes, you must consult a specialist immediately. You can either go to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist if you have issues with your eyes.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nRead on to discover which\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0you should visit for your eye condition.\\xa0\\nOptometrists VS Ophthalmologists\\nAn optometrist attends optometry school for four years and usually do a year of residency. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist goes to medical school for four years and does a four-year residency. Also, an ophthalmologist typically does a fellowship for one to two years. They can choose a specialty like glaucoma or pediatrics. Ophthalmologists will have an MD or DO following their name while optometrists will have an OD after their names.\\xa0\\nWho Should You Go To?\\nBoth optometrists and ophthalmologists can prescribe eyeglasses and\\xa0contact lenses. The main difference between the two professions is that an ophthalmologist performs surgeries while optometrists don’t. Ophthalmologists are surgeons who can also treat eye diseases. States may indicate which conditions optometrists can treat while ophthalmologists can treat all eye diseases.\\nFor eye exams and prescriptions, you can go to both eye doctors. Usually, an optometrist is the better option for those who need more contacts. On the other hand, those who need surgeries should consult an ophthalmologist. It’s the same for serious conditions like macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\\xa0\\nFor your eye care needs, you can depend on Lumen Optometric.

Both organizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia, and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life.\\n\\n\\nWhat is Myopia?\\nMyopia causes blurry distance vision, which can be compensated for with glasses or contact lenses to provide a child with clear vision. However, myopia is caused by an eye that is growing too long and, once started, myopia usually gets worse in children as the eye continues to grow abnormally fast. Higher myopia increases the lifetime risk of serious eye diseases such as retinal diseases and glaucoma.\\nHow Bad is the Myopia epidemic?\\nIn late 2019, the American Academy of Ophthalmology created a Task Force on Myopia, recognizing the importance of this growing disease in children and the potential lifelong impact myopia has on individuals and society. This task force identified priorities of educating other physicians, working with government agencies and health agencies, and educating parents and schools about this issue so that more proactive steps can be taken to help children.\\nTreehouse Eyes Co-founder, Matt Oerding, was recently interviewed about the prevalence of myopia alongside Dr. William Reynolds of the American Optometric Association and Dr. Emily McCourt, the chief of ophthalmology at Children’s Hospital Colorado.” Over the last two decades, there’s been an increase in myopia or nearsightedness worldwide, not just in the United States. And that corresponds with an increase in near devices, especially digital devices,” Reynolds said. Watch the full interview by clicking here. \\nMyopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050.\\nCan Myopia be Stopped?\\nThere is hope for parents, however, as several treatments are now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good candidate for treatment.\\nYou can prevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling your child’s myopia consultation with us today.

It’s estimated that the 700,000 workplace eye injuries that happen every year cost businesses roughly $934 million in combined productivity loss, health costs, fines, and employee compensation. That’s why employers are being encouraged to promote vision health among their employees this Workplace Eye Wellness Month.\\xa0\\nLumen Optometric, your trusted\\xa0eye exam doctor, shares eye care tips below: \\xa0\\n\\n\\nRemind Employees to Observe the 20-20-20 Rule\\nWhile using a computer, you should take short breaks to allow your eye muscles to rest. Every 20 minutes, employees should look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.\\nAvoid Sitting Too Close to the Computer Screen\\nA common myth is that you can develop myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) if you sit too close to the screen. However, this myth has been debunked by the fact the two vision conditions have strong genetic links. While sitting close to the screen won’t cause nearsightedness or farsightedness, it can increase digital eye strain.\\xa0\\nTo prevent digital eye strain, the computer screen should be about 20 to 28 inches away from the face. However, if employees keep moving closer to the screen to see better, they should see an eye specialist as soon as possible. That’s because they may need a higher prescription for their eyeglasses or\\xa0contact lenses.\\xa0\\nAdjust the Computer’s Display Settings\\xa0\\nAnother way to reduce digital eye strain is to adjust the computer’s display settings to make it easier for your eyes to follow the text and see images. Adjust the computer display’s brightness to the same level as your workplace’s brightness, enlarge the font size for easier viewing, and reduce the color temperature to reduce the blue light—the short-wavelength visible light associated with increased eye strain—emitted. Alternatively, employees can also wear computer glasses, which have yellow-tinted lenses that block blue light. For more tips on reducing your exposure to blue light, consult your local eye doctor.\\xa0\\nLumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including eye examination and\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0services.

Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, with the symptom being blurry distance vision. Studies show that myopia rates in children are increasing as kids spend less time outdoors and more time involved in near work like digital device use.\\n\\nWhat many parents don’t know is that rapidly progressing myopia is more than just a hassle — it can harm your child’s eye health. Children with progressive myopia are far more likely to develop potentially sight-threatening eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration later in life.\\nGiven the growing prevalence of myopia in children the media are taking notice. There have been a number of articles recently about this issue in the New York Times, Women Fitness and more locally here in Bay Area Moms and Macaroni Kid.\\xa0 These articles have great tips for parents. We recommended kids get outside at least 2-3 hours a day and take frequent breaks from screen use to help their vision. We also offer new myopia treatments, including customized contact lenses and prescription eye drops, that we can use to treat myopia. Our practice specializes in providing these treatments and offers myopia consultations to customize a treatment plan for each child.\\nWhat Causes Myopia to Progress?\\nGenetics play a large role in myopia development. Two nearsighted parents are more likely to have a myopic child than a couple with only one myopic parent, or no myopic parents at all.\\nNo one knows exactly why myopia progresses, but spending most of the day indoors, focusing on near objects like screens and books, may be risk factors. More research is needed to determine whether the fact that children are spending less time looking at faraway objects like a moving baseball or a basketball net might be contributing to the increase in myopia cases around the world.\\nHow Can I Prevent Myopia From Worsening?\\nOne of the best pieces of advice for parents of nearsighted children is to increase their child’s outdoor playtime in the sun. In research studies, the progression of myopia was slower in children who spent a considerable amount of time in the sunshine than in children who did not.\\nThe World Health Organization advises that children under 5 spend 1 hour or less per day in front of a screen, and no screen time is recommended for infants under 1. The Children’s Eye Foundation recommends outdoor play daily, and no screen time for children under 2. They also recommend no more than 1-2 hours per day for 2- to 5-year-olds, with frequent breaks.\\nHow Can a Myopia Management Eye Doctor Help?\\nMyopia management eye doctors do more than prescribe corrective lenses. Although no actual cure for myopia exists, there are methods that can help control its progression. Like most treatments, myopia treatment in children is most effective when started early before a child is highly myopic. Our office partners with Treehouse Eyes, the country’s leading provider of myopia treatments for children. This Wall Street Journal article featured Treehouse Eyes in a recent article discussing the growing issue of childhood myopia.\\nCall us at 626-921-0199 or schedule an appointment online for your child today for a myopia consultation. We will assess your child’s vision and eye health, and recommend a treatment plan that will be right for your family.\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Primary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

When it\\ncomes to their vision, early detection of issues like nearsightedness (myopia) is crucial\\nfor timely intervention and effective management. Myopia can impact a child’s academic\\nperformance, social interactions, and overall quality of life if left unaddressed. In this\\narticle, we’ll highlight key signs that parents should watch for to identify if their child may\\nbe experiencing nearsightedness.\\n\\n\\nFrequent Squinting:\\nOne of the most common signs of nearsightedness in children is squinting. If you notice\\nyour child squinting often, especially when trying to see distant objects like road signs or\\nthe whiteboard at school, it could indicate that they are having difficulty focusing on\\ndistant objects.\\nSitting Close to the TV or Holding Devices Close:\\nChildren with nearsightedness may instinctively sit closer to the television or hold digital\\ndevices closer to their face to see more clearly. While occasional closeness to screens\\nis common, persistent behavior of this nature could be a red flag for myopia.\\nComplaints of Headaches or Eye Strain:\\nChildren experiencing nearsightedness may complain of frequent headaches or eye\\nstrain, particularly after engaging in activities that require focusing on distant objects for\\nextended periods, such as reading or watching movies in a theater.\\nDifficulty Seeing the Whiteboard or Screen at School:\\nIf your child consistently has difficulty seeing the whiteboard or screen in the classroom,\\ndespite sitting in the front rows, it could indicate nearsightedness. They may also\\nstruggle to recognize faces or objects from a distance.\\nRubbing Eyes Frequently:\\nExcessive rubbing of the eyes can be a sign of eye fatigue or strain, which often\\naccompanies nearsightedness. If you observe your child rubbing their eyes frequently,\\nespecially after engaging in activities that require visual concentration, it’s worth\\ninvestigating further.\\nDecline in Academic Performance:\\nUnexplained declines in academic performance, particularly in subjects that require\\nvisual acuity like reading or math, may be attributed to undiagnosed nearsightedness. If\\nyour child’s grades suddenly drop or they express frustration with schoolwork, consider\\nscheduling an eye exam.\\nFamily History of Myopia:\\nGenetics play a significant role in the development of myopia. If one or both parents\\nhave myopia, there’s an increased likelihood that their children will also develop the\\ncondition. Keep this in mind and remain vigilant for signs of nearsightedness in your\\nchild, especially if there’s a family history.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia:\\nRecognizing the signs of nearsightedness in your child early on is essential for proactive\\nintervention and effective management. If you observe any of the aforementioned signs\\nor have concerns about your child’s vision, don’t hesitate to schedule an myopia\\nconsultation with a Treehouse Eyes provider. Remember, addressing vision issues\\npromptly can significantly impact your child’s overall well-being and success in various\\naspects of life. Let’s work together to ensure our children’s vision remains clear for a\\nbright future ahead.\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Primary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

It can help you sleep better by regulating your circadian rhythm. Studies show that daily and healthy exposure to sunlight can benefit the eyes of little ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA local\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0explains why safe sun exposure is great for your children’s eyes.\\xa0\\nSunlight and Your Kids’ Eyes\\nMyopia or nearsightedness happens when the shape of the eye is too curved, keeping light from properly focusing on the retina. People who have it struggle to see distant objects. When not detected and treated early, it can affect a child’s performance in school and at play.\\xa0\\nHave you noticed that your child blinks or squints a lot? Do they often complain of headaches or that they can’t see the words on the board at school? If so, it’s best to schedule a visit with your local optometrist. These are typical signs of nearsightedness in children. At Lumen Optometric, we are here for your family’s vision correction and\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0needs.\\xa0\\nMoreover, research shows that children who spend time outdoors are less likely to develop this vision condition. Experts believe bright sunlight can aid in the retina’s production of dopamine, a hormone that can help regulate eye growth.\\xa0\\nTips for Healthy Sun Exposure\\nWhile natural light might benefit your child’s eyes, you should discourage them from looking directly at the sun. Like adults, they need to wear UV-blocking sunglasses to keep their eyes safe from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. Even when it’s cloudy outside, you and your child should apply sunscreen and wear sunglasses.\\xa0\\nWearing a wide-brimmed hat can also reduce the UV rays that reach your little one’s eyes. Then, limit their time outdoors during the sun’s peak hours, which is from midday to early afternoon.\\xa0\\nRoutine eye exams can help you keep track of your family’s vision and eye health. Leave your eye care needs to Lumen Optometric.

It affects the cornea, or the clear layer that covers your eye’s iris and protects the pupil. Lumen Optometric discusses its causes, symptoms, and treatment.\\n\\n\\nWhat Causes a Scratched Cornea?\\nAnything that comes into contact with the clear surface of your eyes can lead to a corneal abrasion. Rubbing your eyes too hard can cause a scratched cornea, as well as a grain of dust or sand getting lodged on the front of your eye. Wearing contact lenses longer than is recommended and poking your eye accidentally can also lead to this type of eye injury.\\nThe risk of a scratched cornea increases when you experience dry eye syndrome. Being diagnosed with this condition makes it hard for you to sleep, since the eyelids may stick to the cornea. Upon waking up, your eyelids may tear a part of your cornea, resulting in a scratch or abrasion.\\nWhat Are the Symptoms of a Scratched Cornea?\\nAny eye injury, including a corneal abrasion, must be examined by your eye doctor. Visit them right away if you start experiencing any of these symptoms:\\nBlurry vision.Eye pain that doesn’t resolve in minutes or hours.Feeling that something’s stuck in your eye.Foreign matter lodged in front of your eyes like dirt or small particles.Light sensitivity\\nHow Is Corneal Abrasion Treated?\\nBefore you visit your eye doctor, consider reducing the symptoms and the risk of infection. You can rinse the affected eye with saline solution to dislodge specks of dust or dirt. Try blinking several times as well to move the small particles from the cornea to the eyelashes.\\xa0\\nYour eye doctor will examine the affected eye and remove any objects they may find. To minimize discomfort during this prescription, they’ll apply anesthetic eye drops. They may prescribe you with eye drops to keep the eye lubricated and minimize infection and inflammation, as well as oral medication if you feel pain or light sensitivity.

They might experience difficulty seeing in dimly lit areas. As you age, your risk of developing certain eye conditions also increases. These are among the many reasons seniors should see their eye doctor regularly.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about the importance of senior eye care from a local\\xa0scleral optometrist. \\xa0\\nWhy Is Senior Eye Care Important?\\nIndividuals over 60 are more prone to eye diseases that can lead to irreversible vision changes. Many of these conditions do not manifest symptoms until they are in their later stages. Some of the most usual age-related eye problems include cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Dry eye and retinal detachment are also common in seniors. Moreover, their early detection and treatment are crucial to preserve vision and improve quality of life. \\xa0\\nQuick Eye Care Tips for Seniors\\nSchedule Routine Eye Exams\\xa0\\nRegardless of age, you must see your eye doctor regularly. Routine comprehensive eye exams can detect eye problems in their initial stages. Early treatment of vision-threatening conditions is essential to preserving vision. Also, only an eye care specialist can trace changes in your vision. They can determine if you need\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0or new prescription eyewear.\\nMake Indoor Spaces More Accessible\\nGood lighting can enhance the safety of your living space. Place nightlights in hallways, bedrooms and hallways to reduce the likelihood of falling or tripping. To make rooms easier to navigate, consider having furnishings, walls and flooring in contrasting colors. For instance, light-colored countertops make dark-colored items easier to see.\\xa0\\nEat Nourishing Meals\\xa0\\nLeafy greens, nuts, oily fish and citrus fruits are beneficial to eye health. Eat foods rich in zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, carotenoids, and vitamins A, C, and E. Meanwhile, minimize your consumption of foods high in saturated fats, sodium and sugar.\\nExercise Regularly \\xa0\\nDaily movement can improve blood circulation in your eyes. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight, lowering your risk of diabetes. Walking, stretching and yoga are gentler exercises seniors can try.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAllow Lumen Optometric to handle your vision and eye care needs.

As such, you’ll want to know which type of contact lenses best suit your needs and preferences, so it does its job while not getting in the way of your daily routine. However, with so many specific choices available, it can be a bit overwhelming to work out which type of lenses are best for your use.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTo help you determine your most preferred type of contact lenses,\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0expert Lumen Optometric has put together a quick comparison between daily and monthly contact lenses, and which is most ideal for your daily use.\\nDaily Contact Lenses\\xa0\\nAlso known as daily disposables, they come ready to insert in individual blister packs for one-day use. When the day’s done and you’re about to sleep in for the night, just dispose of your lenses in the trash. When you wake up, you open another blister pack for a new pair.\\nYou don’t need to worry about cleaning or storing the lenses each time you use daily\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0since they’re disposable. They’re also generally very thin and have a high water content, and if you remove these contacts during the day for any reason, you’ll need to replace them with a fresh new pair.\\nMonthly Contact Lenses\\nThese lenses are thicker and more durable than daily lenses because they have to resist drying out while you store and use them for 30 days. When you aren’t wearing them, you can store the contact lenses in a small two-sided container with some contact solution.\\xa0\\nWhen using monthly contact lenses, you need to clean them to avoid infections and protein buildup. There are various contact solutions you can use to clean monthly lenses, and you should only use the ones recommended by your eye doctor. This is because different brands and types of solutions that use different chemicals can be incompatible and even destroy a contact they’re not designed for.\\nWhich is More Ideal for Your Use?\\nThe type of contact lenses you’ll use can actually depend on what your trusted eye doctor prescribes you. Your prescription might determine whether you choose monthly or daily contact lenses, but not all types of contacts are available for every prescription. For instance, if you need multifocal lenses, some are only available as monthlies. But if your prescription allows you to use both daily and monthly lenses, then you can consider which is better for your lifestyle.\\nIf your lifestyle makes it likely that something may get in your eye, then having daily disposables means you can just take out the lens and throw it out so you won’t have to bother with trying to clean the contact of any contaminants. This is especially handy if you work outdoors or don’t have easy access to facilities to clean and store your contact lenses. But if you have a controlled lifestyle and always have access to a washroom and mirror to remove and clean your lenses if needed, then monthlies could work better for your daily use.\\nWhen you need to have your eyes checked by a trusted\\xa0eye exam doctor, don’t hesitate to visit Lumen Optometric.

Overexposure to the sun, particularly its UV rays, can damage your eyes too. This eye condition is called photokeratitis or ultraviolet keratitis.\\n\\n\\nYour trusted\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0at Lumen Optometric lists the symptoms of photokeratitis and what you can do to treat your sunburned eyes.\\nSymptoms of Sunburned Eyes\\nIt can be hard to tell when your eyes are already being overexposed to the sun. But if your eyes hurt whenever you look at an area near the sun, it’s usually an indication that your eyes have been overexposed to UV rays. Apart from this, you may also experience the following symptoms:\\neye painlight sensitivityblurry visionredness or discomfort in the eyesseeing haloseyelid twitchingheadachegritty feeling in the eyestemporary loss of vision\\nThese symptoms can last for one or two days. But if you already have them for more than 48 hours or you experience loss of vision that does not get better in a few hours, you should call your eye doctor to make sure everything is fine.\\nHow to Treat Sunburned Eyes\\nPhotokeratitis usually resolves on its own within a couple of days, so its treatment is mainly focused on reducing discomfort from the symptoms. During this time, make sure to rest your eyes and remove your\\xa0contact lenses. This will help your eyes heal more quickly. You can also ask your doctor if they will recommend pain relievers or antibiotic eye drops.\\nBelow are some other at-home remedies that you can try:\\nClose your eyes and place cool compress over them.Don’t rub your eyes as this will only cause further irritation.Lubricate your eyes with artificial tears. But make sure to ask your doctor if it’s OK.If you are wearing eyelash extensions, ask your doctor if you should have them removed or not.\\nLumen Optometric offers an array of eye care services including eye exams,\\xa0corneal reshaping, dry eye treatment and more.

AMD typically occurs as aging causes damage to the macula, a part of the retina that controls sharp vision. While it does not cause total blindness, AMD makes it harder for people to perform their daily routines, such as reading, driving, or doing any close-up work.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn this article, Lumen Optometric, known for high-quality eyeglasses and\\xa0contact lenses, explains everything you need to know about AMD.\\xa0\\nWhat Are the Different Types and Symptoms of AMD?\\nThere are two types of AMD: dry and wet. Dry AMD, also called atrophic AMD, occurs when the macula gets thinner and progresses slowly over many years. It also has three stages: early, intermediate, and late. During the early and intermediate dry AMD stage, some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience mild blurriness in their central vision.\\xa0\\nOn the other hand, wet AMD, also called advanced neovascular AMD, is a less common type of late AMD. It happens when abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, which eventually causes damage to the macula. As such, wet AMD causes faster vision loss. It’s important to note that any stage of dry AMD can turn into wet AMD, but wet AMD is always late.\\xa0\\nPeople with late AMD may notice straight lines looking wavy or crooked. They may also see a blurry area near the center of their vision, which may get bigger as time goes by. Some people report seeing blank spots or having trouble seeing in low lighting. If you experience any of these symptoms, be sure to see an optometrist immediately.\\xa0\\nHow Do Doctors Diagnose AMD?\\nOne effective way to check if you have AMD is through an eye exam. Your\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0may also perform any of the following procedures to diagnose AMD successfully:\\nDistance and near vision acuity testsDilated eye examination (which also includes using an ophthalmoscope) — The pupil of your eye is dilated to allow your doctor to observe your macula at the inside back wall of the eye.Optical coherence tomography testing (OCT) — To gain a clearer picture of your macula and its supporting layers, OCT generates high-quality images of the eye.\\xa0\\nDo you have more inquiries regarding proper eye care?

It affects all of the systems of the body, including the eyes. The decrease in estrogen levels can alter one’s eyesight. Even the shape of the eyes undergoes a slight change, making it hard for women to wear\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0comfortably.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEye Conditions Associated With Menopause\\n\\nThe following are some of the most common eye conditions that affect women during menopause:\\n\\n\\n\\nDry Eyes\\xa0– Women over the age of 50 have been shown to be at high risk of developing symptoms of dry eye syndrome such as blurred vision, light sensitivity and swollen or reddened eyelids. The decrease in hormone levels can also lower the salinity of the inner tear film and the oils of the outer tear film.\\n\\n\\nCataracts\\xa0–\\xa0Decreased hormone levels can also increase the risk for cataracts. Common signs and symptoms include seeing fading colors and halos around light sources and having difficulty seeing at night. Scheduling regular visits to your\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0can help detect this condition early.\\n\\n\\nGlaucoma\\xa0– This eye condition is also common in menopausal women. It leads to the damage of the optic nerve, usually from increased eye pressure. Early detection and treatment can help protect the eyes from vision loss associated with glaucoma.\\n\\n\\n\\nEye Care During Menopause\\n\\nTaking a proactive approach is the best way to preserve your vision during your menopause years. In addition to annual eye exams, your eye doctor may recommend hormone therapy to restore your estrogen levels. While it may help reduce the risk of developing these eye conditions, patients who undergo such are four to seven times more likely to develop dry eye symptoms.\\n\\nOther ways to control menopause symptoms include a more natural approach like taking herbal supplements and consuming a diet rich in Vitamin D. Lifestyle changes can also help reduce dry eye symptoms like removing drafts and wearing wraparound sunglasses outdoors.\\n\\nLumen Optometric offers a wide range of eye care services, including myopia management and\\xa0corneal reshaping.

We will be discussing the four best ways to treat your myopia so it no longer gets worse. Everything we discuss is based on solid science and research, double-masked clinical trials, and recommendations based on mountains of peer-reviewed data. Certainly, we’ve heard and researched other more holistic approaches, if they turn out to be effective, know that this is surely a growing field however and as things change you’ll certainly hear it from us first!\\nWhat is Myopia?\\nBefore you can defeat your enemy, you need to know exactly what it is. Myopia is a disease of the eye that is usually the result of an eyeball that has grown too long. We call how long the eyeball is the ‘axial length’. When the axial length grows excessively long, your vision will suffer in direct correlation. So any treatment we discuss has to show efficacy in its ability to reduce axial length elongation compared to a control group. Other times, the cornea may be too steep which can also cause myopia. However, for the sake of this article, we will address the major cause of myopia which is the excessive axial length of the eye. As when we talk about managing myopia, we will be talking about ways that have shown clinical evidence in slowing down axial length growth.\\nCustom Orthokeratology or Overnight Contact Lenses\\nOrthokeratology involves using a specially designed contact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while sleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names for orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping system, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the curvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina.\\nWhile initially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see more clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in reducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused in front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the optical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact lenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning, and disinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper hygiene this is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating children of almost any age.\\nAtropine\\nAtropine is a pharmaceutical agent that can be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to treat children with amblyopia, or sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic progression.\\nCustom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses\\nMore contact lenses are being designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight contact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia by almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers throughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral retina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact lens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia as well as prevent the eye from growing too long.\\nSpecial Myopia Treating Eyeglasses\\nMore glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a similar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is a particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact lenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s bodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of power in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial length elongation.\\nTreehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression\\nThe good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids—just like yours—so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above are four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been diagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with a contact lens while sleeping. Atropine involves an eye drop that can signal the eye to grow a little slower. Custom soft multifocal lenses are worn during the day. And even specially designed glasses are on the horizon to improve the progression of myopia.\\nThe Treehouse Eyes eye doctors use state-of-the-art equipment to develop a personalized treatment plan for your child. Our non-invasive treatments include customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops. Moreover, data shows that our patent-pending Treehouse Vision System® treatment plan can decrease myopia progression by 78%.\\nGive your child the tools they need to succeed!

But with so many of these conditions identified by the medical community, it can be hard to list down all of their possible effects on the eyes. Understanding the risk your specific autoimmune disorder poses to your vision is key to ensuring optimal eye health. Consult your eye doctor immediately if you start experiencing eyesight problems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this blog, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye care center for\\xa0neurolens® treatment, shares some of the autoimmune disorders that affect the eyes.\\n\\nLupus\\n\\nIt is a type of autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body, including the eyes. It can lead to eye-related conditions like retinal vascular lesions and optic neuropathy. Symptoms may include blurred vision, sore or dry eyes, and light sensitivity.\\n\\nRheumatoid Arthritis\\n\\nIt is a chronic multisystem disease with musculoskeletal manifestations. While it primarily targets the hands, arms, legs and feet, this inflammatory disorder can also affect the eyes. Dry eye syndrome, however, is the most common eye condition to accompany rheumatoid arthritis. A visit to an eye doctor can help determine necessary\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0to alleviate discomfort. Other eye-related conditions associated with rheumatoid arthritis include scleritis (inflammation of the white part of the eye) and uveitis (inflammation of the tissues in the eyewall).\\n\\nMultiple Sclerosis\\n\\nThis autoimmune disorder affects the central nervous system. Given that the optic nerve is directly connected to it, an individual may be diagnosed with MS after the development of initial symptoms of vision problems. Optic neuritis, for instance, can bring a combination of color vision loss, blurred vision and double vision that usually affects only one eye.\\n\\nTurn to Lumen Optometric for your immediate and ongoing optic needs.

Seeking a comprehensive eye examination after a concussion is crucial for several reasons, including the detection and management of vision problems that may arise as a result of the head injury. Continue reading as a trusted\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0further discusses the importance of having your eyes checked post-concussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisual Disturbances and Concussions\\nConcussions can lead to a range of visual disturbances, such as blurred vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia) and difficulty focusing. These symptoms may not be immediately apparent but can manifest in the days or weeks following the injury. A post-concussion eye exam helps identify and address these issues, promoting a more effective recovery.\\nDetecting Ocular Motor Dysfunction\\nConcussions often affect the coordination of eye movements, known as ocular motor function. This can result in difficulties with tracking objects, maintaining focus or experiencing eye strain. A specialized eye examination can pinpoint ocular motor dysfunction, guiding the implementation of targeted therapies to improve eye coordination and alleviate associated symptoms.\\nAssessing Binocular Vision Problems\\nBinocular vision problems, where the eyes struggle to work together seamlessly, are common after concussions. This can lead to double vision, depth perception challenges and discomfort. Through a comprehensive check, an eye doctor can assess binocular vision problems and recommend appropriate interventions, such as vision therapy or corrective lenses.\\nAddressing Light Sensitivity\\nPhotophobia is a frequent symptom post-concussion. Exposure to light can exacerbate headaches and discomfort, whether you’re wearing eyeglasses or\\xa0contact lenses. Optometrists can evaluate the extent of light sensitivity during an eye exam and recommend strategies to manage it effectively. This may include specialized lenses or advice on controlling lighting environments.\\nPreventing Prolonged Visual Symptoms\\nEarly detection and intervention are key to preventing prolonged visual symptoms after a concussion. Without proper assessment and treatment, visual issues may persist and impact daily life. Timely eye exams can identify underlying problems and enable the implementation of targeted therapies, promoting a smoother recovery process.\\nLumen Optometric is a trusted eye specialist in the area.

(While staring at a computer screen, you tend to blink less often. This increases the risk of dry eye because blinking is how a tear film—which helps keep your eyes moist—is spread across the surface of your eye.)\\xa0\\nHowever, recent studies have shown that having diabetes mellitus increases your risk for dry eyes.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLumen Optometric, your trusted\\xa0eye exam doctor, explains how diabetes and dry eyes are connected and elaborate on the possible treatment options below:\\xa0\\nHow Diabetes and Dry Eyes Are Connected\\xa0\\nSome medical researchers believe diabetic neuropathy can explain the connection between diabetes and dry eyes. Neuropathy happens when some of the nerves are damaged. It’s also a risk factor for lacrimal gland dysfunction. If the lacrimal gland (which secretes the watery component of the tear film) is damaged, tear production decreases. This, in turn, increases a patient’s risk for dry eyes.\\xa0\\nImportant: Diabetes is just one of several factors that can increase your risk for dry eyes. Other factors include age (it’s not uncommon for people aged over 65 to experience dry eyes) and environmental conditions (tears evaporate more quickly in dry climates).\\xa0\\nIf you have any of the aforementioned risk factors, you should undergo an eye exam at least once a year. Through routine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect and treat eye conditions before they progress or give higher prescriptions for\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0before blurry vision interferes with your daily routines.\\xa0\\nHow Are Dry Eyes Treated\\xa0\\nYour eye doctor may recommend the following treatment options:\\xa0\\nArtificial tears\\xa0– To alleviate the symptoms of mild or moderate dry eyes, you may need to apply artificial tears several times during the day.\\xa0Eye inserts\\xa0– An eye insert resembles a grain of rice and releases lubrication as it dissolves. It is placed between your lower eyelid and your eyeball. \\xa0\\nTo learn more about your treatment options, consult your local eye doctor.\\xa0\\nLumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0services.

These lenses offer a smooth transition between distances, eliminating the need for multiple glasses. They can also help treat other eye conditions. However, progressive lenses have pros and cons like any vision correction option.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this article, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of progressive lenses to help you decide whether they are the right choice for you.\\nPros of Progressive Lenses\\nHere are some of the benefits of progressive lenses.\\nImproved Vision\\nProgressive lenses provide a more seamless transition between different prescriptions, allowing for clearer vision at all distances. Wearers can see objects at varying lengths without switching glasses or straining their eyes.\\nGreater Comfort\\nProgressive lenses eliminate the visible lines that come with traditional bifocals or trifocals. This makes them a more comfortable option for extended wear, particularly for activities like driving or using a computer.\\nMore Natural Vision\\xa0\\nProgressive lenses provide a more natural visual experience than traditional bifocals or reading glasses. This is because they offer a gradual change in prescription, mimicking how the eyes naturally adjust to different distances.\\nImproved Aesthetics\\nWith no visible line, progressive lenses provide a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. This appeals to those who want to avoid the stigma of traditional bifocals or reading glasses.\\nCons of Progressive Lenses\\nDespite their many advantages, there are drawbacks to progressive lenses. These include the following:\\nCost\\nProgressive lenses can be more expensive than traditional bifocals or reading glasses because they require more advanced technology. This can be a barrier for those on a budget or without insurance coverage for vision correction.\\nAdaptation Period\\xa0\\nAdjusting to progressive lenses can take some time. This can cause some initial discomfort or disorientation.\\nReduced Peripheral Vision\\nSince progressive lenses have a narrow corridor of clear vision, wearers may experience reduced peripheral vision. This can be a safety concern, especially when driving or navigating unfamiliar environments.\\nIncreased Risk of Glare\\nProgressive lenses can create more reflections and glare, particularly in bright light conditions. This can be an issue for those outdoors or in environments with bright lighting.\\nHow to Adapt to Progressive Lenses\\nWhen adapting to progressive lenses, allow a few days for your eyes to get used to your new lens prescription. Practice focusing on familiar objects that are located at different distances from you so you can easily switch between far and near vision when needed. Patience also goes a long way in getting used to progressive lenses.\\nTo be sure that progressive lenses are right for you, schedule a consultation at Lumen Optometric.\\xa0Our experts can assist you with everything from\\xa0Neurolens treatment\\xa0to\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0in Sierra Madre, CA.

As a parent, you also want to make sure that your child can see well enough to do the things they enjoy doing. Pediatric optometrists are specialized healthcare professionals who care for the visual and ocular needs of infants, children, and teens.\\nIn this article, we will discuss some factors you must consider when choosing an\\xa0optometrist for your children.\\n\\nLocation\\nLocation is essential when choosing the\\xa0best optometrist for kids near you. If your child has a busy schedule, it may be more difficult for them to travel long distances to get to their appointments. Maybe you’re unsure about how far away from home an office is. Ask the doctor or staff if they have any recommendations on other practices they could recommend that might better suit your needs.\\nCall ahead if multiple offices are within driving distance of your home. Make sure each office offers the same services before making an appointment with them.\\nExperience\\nThe experience of an optometrist for children is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing the best eye doctor for kids. An excellent way to gauge this is by asking how long they’ve been practicing optometry and whether they have additional training relevant to your child’s specific needs (such as myopia management).\\nTreehouse Eyes provides expert pediatric myopia care and ensures this with accessibility to Treehouse AMP, a video-based parent education platform. Treehouse Eyes doctors are always willing to answer any questions regarding myopia and while also cultivating a kid-friendly office experience.\\nRecommendations\\nThe best way to find a pediatric optometrist you can rely on and who will get along well with your child is through referrals and recommendations. If you know someone who had a positive experience with an eye doctor, find out who they used and why they thought so highly of them.\\nConsider that some of your friends have young children of their own. Before choosing which practice is best for you and your family, it might be useful to know what kind of experiences other people have had there.\\nIf no one in your family or circle of friends can personally recommend an optometrist, look online for reviews of nearby practices. You can also use the Google Maps business filter by typing “optometrist for children near me” into the search bar. You can add whatever city or town you live in and see the reviews. This should bring up several options nearby where children receive treatment from professionals specializing in vision care issues explicitly related to young people (such as myopia).\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor.

The right glasses are comfortable and give you sharp vision throughout the day. Despite the dependability of this eyewear, it can still cause spots or pimples to form on your face. Fortunately, there are several ways to avoid this issue.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHere’s what you can do to prevent breakouts from wearing eyeglasses.\\xa0\\nClean Your Glasses Frequently\\nThe pressure that eyeglasses put on your skin is what usually causes acne. It prevents dead skin cells from shedding, causing them to clog your pores and form pimples. If you have oily skin or wear thick layers of makeup, you are more likely to get breakouts from eyeglass wear. Regularly cleaning your eyeglasses will help prevent breakouts. You can use an alcohol wipe to clean them, focusing on areas that touch your skin. \\xa0\\nHave Your Glasses Adjusted\\nDoes it feel like your glasses are so heavy or pushing too hard on your nose? Excessive pressure from your glasses can contribute to breakouts. If this is the case, see your eye doctor and have your eyeglass frame adjusted. In some cases, replacing the nose bridges allow more even pressure distribution.\\xa0\\nGive Your Face a Break from Eyeglasses\\nWhen you wear eyeglasses every day, it’s easy to forget that you even have them on. While they give you sharper vision, it helps to take breaks from wearing them from time to time. It relieves the pressure on your face that often contributes to breakouts.\\xa0\\nRemove Your Makeup at the End of the Day\\nThoroughly remove your makeup at the end of the day. Cosmetic products can accumulate under your glasses, increasing the likelihood of acne. Using makeup remover before cleansing ensures that you’re really getting rid of the products on your face.\\xa0\\nDon’t wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor. At Lumen Optometric, we offer a wide range of eye care services, including myopia treatment and orthokeratology.

Without proper treatment, vision problems can affect a child’s learning, increase the risk of permanent vision loss and even lead to behavioral issues. The American Optometric Association strongly recommends your little one see an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0yearly.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThis Healthy Vision Month, we are sharing tips on taking a proactive approach to your child’s eye health.\\nAvoid Excess Screen Time\\nAt least two screen time increases the risk of obesity, mood swings, aggressive behavior and obesity in children. The blue light from digital devices can contribute to digital eye strain. This eye condition is usually characterized by blurred vision, dry eye, headaches, and neck and shoulder pain. According to the Department of Health, children below two should have no screen time because it can affect physical and language development.\\xa0\\nSchedule Regular Eye Exams\\nIt’s a common misconception that you only need to see an eye care specialist if you need to update your\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0or eyeglasses. Regular eye exams can detect and treat eye conditions early in adults and children. If you see your child constantly squinting, tilting their head, or rubbing their eyes, schedule an appointment with your eye doctor immediately. These are common signs of vision problems in young individuals.\\xa0\\nPrepare Well-Balanced Meals\\nIncorporating leafy greens and foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids in your daily meals is beneficial to the entire family’s eye health. Vitamin A in leafy greens can lower the risk of dry eye syndrome, while omega-3 fatty acids can lower the risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. It’s also a good idea to consume fruits rich in vitamins C and E, such as pineapples, oranges, strawberries and mangoes. These vitamins can help restore tissues in your eyes and prevent infections.

Protecting your eyes from the sun’s damage is crucial to maintaining good eye health and preventing problems down the road. This blog post discusses the risks of UV exposure and provides you with practical tips for keeping your eyes safe from the sun’s harmful effects.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstand the Risks of UV Exposure\\nUV exposure can have both short-term and long-term effects on your eyes. In the short term, you may experience photokeratitis, also known as “sunburn of the eye,” or pterygium, a growth on the white of the eye. Long-term damage includes cataracts and macular degeneration. Some individuals are at higher risk for UV-related eye problems, such as outdoor workers and those with light-colored eyes.\\nChoose the Right Sunglasses\\nThe right pair of sunglasses can play a significant role in protecting your eyes from UV damage. Look for sunglasses labeled with 100% UVA and UVB protection. Lens color and tint can also make a difference. Gray, green and brown lenses can help maintain color recognition. Consider polarized lenses to reduce glare, especially if you spend a lot of time near water or snow. Wraparound frames offer added protection by shielding your eyes from sunlight entering from the sides.\\nWear a Wide-Brimmed Hat\\nA wide-brimmed hat can provide additional protection from indirect sunlight. By reducing your exposure to harmful UV rays, you can lower the risk of eye damage.\\nSchedule Regular Eye Exams\\nEarly detection and prevention are essential to maintaining good eye health. Regular visits to an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0can help you monitor changes in your vision and eye health. Comprehensive exams can catch problems early, giving you the best chance for successful treatment.\\nConsider Protective Contact Lenses\\nFor contact lens wearers, UV-blocking\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0can offer an added layer of protection against the sun’s harmful rays. Consult an optometrist to determine which type of contact lenses are best suited for you.\\nExplore Orthokeratology\\nOrthokeratology\\xa0or ortho-k, is a treatment that involves wearing specially designed contact lenses overnight to reshape the cornea. This non-surgical procedure can help reduce the risk of UV damage to the eye and improve vision.\\nTake Precautions During Peak Sun Hours\\nAvoiding direct sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. can help protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. If you must be outdoors during these hours, seek shade whenever possible.\\nEducate Children on Eye Protection\\nTeaching children about the importance of eye protection from a young age is crucial for maintaining their long-term eye health. Encourage kids to wear sunglasses and hats when outdoors to shield their eyes from the sun.\\nProtecting your eyes from UV damage is essential for maintaining good eye health. By understanding the risks and taking the necessary precautions, you can reduce your chances of developing UV-related eye problems.

Around 30% of teenagers, 9% of kids in\\nschool, and 5% of preschoolers have it. If both of a child’s parents are nearsighted, the\\nchild is more likely to have myopia. Myopia is generally on the rise, particularly in\\nchildren. Experts believe that it might have something to do with spending more time\\nindoors playing video games and using electronic gadgets. Read on to learn about\\nsome of the best myopia treatment options for children.\\n\\n\\nThe Development of Myopia\\nWhen a child’s eyeball grows too rapidly relative to the usual pace of eye growth,\\nmyopia occurs. It may also develop if the cornea, the transparent window in front of the\\neye, curves too sharply. Light rays are unable to reach the retina when they enter the\\neye, which makes nearby objects look clear and distant objects look blurry.\\nTreating Myopia in Childhood\\nAlthough it cannot be cured or reversed, myopia can be managed and treated. The\\ntreatment’s objectives are to strengthen your child’s vision and stop it from deteriorating.\\nManaging myopia is crucial for maintaining their eye health.\\nTreatment Options to Combat Myopia Progression:\\nSpecialized Contact Lenses:\\n\\nCustomized multifocal contact lenses are tailored to address myopia progression\\nby slowing down eye growth in some children. Additionally, orthokeratology, also\\nknown as Ortho-K, offers a unique solution by reshaping the cornea overnight,\\nthus ensuring clearer vision throughout the day.\\n\\nLow-Dose Atropine Eye Drops:\\n\\nChildren may benefit from the use of low-dose atropine eye drops, similar to\\nthose administered during routine eye examinations. This treatment approach\\nhas shown promise in managing myopia progression effectively.\\n\\nIncreasing Outdoor Time:\\n\\nEncouraging children to spend more time outdoors can help counteract the onset\\nand progression of myopia. Balancing screen time with outdoor activities is vital\\nfor safeguarding their eye health as they continue to grow.\\n\\nConsultation with a Treehouse Eyes Provider:\\nFor parents unsure about the most suitable treatment option for their child, consulting\\nwith a qualified optometrist is essential. Optometrists with myopia management\\nexpertise can provide personalized recommendations and guidance tailored to each\\nchild’s specific needs and circumstances.\\nIn conclusion, addressing myopia in children requires a comprehensive approach\\nfocused on effective treatment strategies and proactive management techniques. By\\nleveraging innovative solutions and collaborating with eye care professionals, parents\\ncan ensure optimal vision health for their children both now and in the future.\\nIf you’re not sure which treatment would be the best choice, consult your optometrist to\\ndetermine how you can manage your child’s myopia.\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Primary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

This eye condition can cause cloudy or blurred vision and increased light sensitivity. Patients may also experience poor night vision or notice that colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile cataracts usually occur in older adults, this eye condition can happen to anyone. A local\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0shares the different types of cataracts.\\xa0\\nTypes of Cataracts\\nAge-Related Cataracts\\xa0\\nCataracts can occur due to the changes in your eyes as you age. You’re more prone to age-related cataracts if you drink alcohol excessively, smoke cigarettes, take steroids and have diabetes. A family history of this eye condition and past eye surgeries also increases your risk for this eye condition.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCongenital Cataracts\\nSome people are born with cataracts or develop them in the first year of life. It’s not common for children to have cataracts. If your child’s cataracts are large enough to impact vision, immediate treatment is necessary to avoid further eye problems, like amblyopia or lazy eye. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTraumatic Cataracts\\nBlunt and penetrating eye injuries usually cause traumatic cataracts. This form of cataract may develop immediately or years after the eye injury.\\xa0\\nSecondary Cataracts\\nThere is a chance for scar tissue to develop in the eye after cataract surgery. If this happens, your vision will become cloudy again. Secondary cataracts are more common than you think and occur in two out of five people who get cataract surgery. A quick and non-invasive procedure called YAG laser capsulotomy is the typical treatment for this type of cataract. Patients usually gain normal vision a few days following treatment.\\xa0\\nHow Are Cataracts Diagnosed?\\nRegular comprehensive eye exams are crucial for the early detection of vision-threatening conditions like macular degeneration and cataracts. Individuals older than 60 should schedule a dilated eye exam every one to two years.\\xa0\\nDuring your appointment, your eye care provider will use dilating eye drops to widen your pupil and check for signs of cataracts and other eye issues. Your doctor might also perform a refraction test, ophthalmoscopy and slit lamp test. These tests will help them determine if you need new prescription glasses or\\xa0dry eye treatment.\\xa0\\nHow Are Cataracts Treated?\\nIf you have cataracts, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. In the initial stages of this eye condition, prescription glasses or contact lenses can help improve vision. You can also use brighter lights in your home and wear anti-glare sunglasses outdoors. Moreover, your eye doctor will recommend surgery if cataracts are starting to disrupt your daily tasks.\\xa0\\nYou don’t need to wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor. Leave your eye care needs to Lumen Optometric. Besides comprehensive eye exams, we also offer\\xa0neurolens treatment, scleral lenses and orthokeratology.

In this article, eye care specialists take a look at profiles of patients who may need extra UV eye protection.\\n\\n\\nConstruction Workers:\\xa0Construction workers and other people who work outdoors are exposed to 10-20% more UV light than the average indoor worker. Even if a worker wears a hat outside, the brim can only block their eyes from overhead UV light and not the indirect UV radiation that is reflected on low-level surfaces.\\nOutdoor Enthusiasts:\\xa0Outdoor enthusiasts such as cyclists and hikers spend a lot of time in the sun, thus requiring some protection from UV. Boaters and beachgoers should also equip themselves with eye protection because dry sand can reflect more than 15% of UV light while sea foam can reflect up to 30%.\\nChildren:\\xa0Some kids tend to spend more time outdoors than adults. Long-term effects of sun damage are cumulative. The longer children are not protected from the harmful rays of the sun, the more likely they will suffer damage to their eyes in their older years.\\nContact Lens Wearers:\\xa0Some patients who wear contact lenses do not bother to wear sunglasses because their contacts block UVA/UVB. While there are lenses that protect from UV radiation, they do not cover everything. The skin of the lids and brow bone are left vulnerable and should be covered with a pair of sunglasses.\\nHealth-Conscious Individuals:\\xa0If you are conscious about your health, you want to minimize your day-to-day interaction with environmental hazards. Aside from eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, safeguarding your eyes from UV radiation should be on your priority list, especially if you have a family history of age-related macular degeneration.\\nLumen Optometric is a premier eye care center specializing in comprehensive eye exams, myopia management, scleral lenses, neurolenses and more.

As such, the process of making prescription lenses involves several steps. Continue reading to learn about prescription lenses, how they are made and the different types available.\\n\\n\\nWhat Are Prescription Lenses?\\nPrescription lenses are tailored spectacles that correct or improve the wearer’s vision. A dedicated optometrist assesses the unique needs of your eyes and prescribes lenses that adjust how light gets into your eyes, helping you see better.\\nThe Process of Making Prescription Lenses\\nMaking prescription lenses involves several steps, from the initial eye examination to the final fitting of the lenses into the frames. Here is a general overview of the process.\\nEye Exam\\nThe process begins with an eye examination by an eye doctor. During the exam, they will determine your specific vision prescription, which includes measurements for each eye, such as sphere power (for nearsightedness or farsightedness), cylinder power (for astigmatism) and axis (the orientation of astigmatism correction). If you have presbyopia, your doctor may also determine your reading prescription.\\nEye exams can also check for eye diseases so your doctor can prescribe the appropriate solution. For those with special eye conditions, you may need to see a specialist, such as a\\xa0scleral optometrist, to get the treatment and visual clarity your eyes need.\\nLens Crafting\\nAfter the examination, your optometrist sends the prescription to a lab where your lenses will be crafted. Here, a machine cuts the lens into the shape advised by your optometrist based on your prescription’s specifications.\\nLens Finishing\\nLastly, your lenses undergo additional treatments. These can include anti-reflective or scratch-resistant coatings, color tints, or UV protection. These coatings improve the clarity and durability of your lenses.\\nTypes of Prescription Lenses\\nThere are various types of prescription lenses available to correct vision problems and suit individual needs. These lenses are typically used in eyeglasses and may include single-vision lenses, with a single prescription power throughout the entire lens. They correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism.\\nBifocals have two different prescription powers in a single lens. The upper part corrects distance vision, while the lower is for near vision. They are commonly prescribed for individuals who have difficulty seeing both up close and at a distance. This condition is often seen in people over 40 with presbyopia.\\nThere are other specialty lenses available for specific needs, such as sports goggles and lenses for low-vision individuals. The type of prescription lens you need depends on your vision correction requirements and lifestyle. An eye care professional will assess your vision and recommend the most suitable lens type for your needs.\\nLumen Optometric is one of the area’s leading eye specialists.

But when these headaches begin to affect your eyesight or if your vision problems start coinciding with headaches, it can be a lot harder for anyone to bear. In this post, Lumen Optometric — a trusted provider of eyeglasses and\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0— discusses how headaches and vision can be interconnected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTypes of Headaches That Can Affect Your Vision\\nMigraines and cluster headaches are the usual types of headache that can affect your vision. Migraines are often described as intense pain in and around the eyes. A “migraine aura” usually precedes them, and it often resembles flashing lights, a prismatic rainbow of lights, or a zigzag pattern of shimmering lights.\\nMeanwhile, cluster headaches usually occur in clusters and cause pain around the eyes. The pain typically radiates down the neck including the shoulders and comes with other symptoms like red eyes, changes in pupil size, eyelid droop, and nasal drainage.\\nVision Problems That Can Trigger Headaches\\nHeadaches caused by vision problems usually start when the eyes are overworked and you can’t maintain focus. Make sure to visit an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0if you are experiencing any of the following:\\n\\nEye Strain – This is common among people who work in front of digital screens for several hours and so they tend to overuse the focusing muscles of their eyes. When eye muscles become fatigued, a headache can be felt specifically around or behind the eyes.\\nFarsightedness – A frontal headache or brow ache may occur if a person is farsighted. Farsightedness can make it difficult for a person to focus on nearby objects, making it possible for eye strain and headaches to develop.\\nAcute Angle-Closure Glaucoma (AACG) – A rare type of glaucoma, it causes the eye pressure to rise quickly and often results in eye pain, eye redness, cloudy vision, and an onset of headaches.\\n\\nLumen Optometric offers exceptional eye care services.

In fact, any changes to your vision should always be taken seriously lest they become serious. Vision changes refer to any alterations in your ability to see properly–and they are caused by a great number of things. The premier expert in\\xa0neurolens treatment, Lumen Optometric, discusses vision changes and what you should know about them.\\n\\n\\nWhat Causes Vision Changes\\nVision changes may stem from the eyes themselves or may be caused by many different conditions that affect the entire body. The most common reasons for these alterations are refractive errors, including myopia or nearsightedness and presbyopia or age-related farsightedness, which affects your ability to focus on objects at a specific distance. And while anyone can suffer from vision changes, the elderly are more prone to them because of possible chronic conditions that affect eyesight.\\xa0\\nAside from refractive errors, the following conditions may cause changes in your vision:\\nAge-related macular degeneration.Cataracts, or the clouding or loss of transparency in the lens of the eye.Dry eyes, which may be caused by blocked tear ducts, and will require\\xa0dry eye treatment.Retinal detachment.Eye infections, such as pink eye or sty.Injuries to the eye because of work-related accidents or otherwise.\\nSymptoms of Vision Changes\\nAny changes in your vision should be dealt with promptly to prevent eye conditions. When overlooked, these can lead to possible vision loss. You might want to visit your trusted local eye doctor immediately should you experience the following:\\nEye painRedness of the eyesBlurred visionIncreased sensitivity to lightDouble visionDischarge from the eyesItchiness and other irritationDroopy eyelidDecreased vision in dimly lit settingsInflammation\\nDetecting Root Cause of Vision Changes\\nThere’s only one thing to do–visit a premier\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0like Lumen Optometric immediately for a comprehensive eye exam. Our eye care specialists will accurately determine what causes these vision changes and start working on your treatment.

As such, you may experience migraines from time to time. Migraines can cause slight discomfort and may even affect your vision and ability to see clearly.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThere are two types of migraine you might have heard of: visual and ocular. While both migraines involve changes in your vision, there are ways to tell them apart. Lumen Optometric, known for quality\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0services, explains the difference between visual and ocular migraines.\\xa0\\nVisual Migraine\\xa0\\nVisual migraine is a temporary visual impairment that may occur simultaneously in both eyes. Most visual migraines last for 30 minutes, but depending on your stress levels and overall health, they may last longer. You may also experience a migraine headache shortly after a visual migraine.\\xa0\\nThe symptoms of visual migraine may vary. These include:\\nFlickering blind spot in the center or near the center of your peripheral fieldA wavy or zigzag ring of colored light surrounding a blind spotA blind spot that slowly migrates across your line of vision\\nIf you frequently experience any of these symptoms, you should consider contacting your optometrist for a\\xa0neurolens treatment.\\nOcular Migraine\\xa0\\nOcular migraine, on the other hand, is a rarer type of migraine. Unlike visual migraine, ocular migraine only affects one eye. It causes temporary loss of vision, which occurs when there is reduced blood flow in the eye. Ocular migraines can also be triggered because of blood vessel spasms in the retina. It typically lasts for about an hour, and vision eventually returns.\\xa0\\nIn addition, the most common symptom of ocular migraine is the appearance of a blind spot. This blind spot affects your field of vision and normally appears first in the center. As the migraine worsens, the blind spot grows and gradually blocks your entire field of vision. A migraine headache may also occur before, during, or after you experience ocular migraine.\\xa0\\nVisual and ocular migraines are usually nothing to be worried about, and they will resolve themselves within an hour or less. Nevertheless, if these types of migraine headaches persist, be sure to book an appointment with your eye doctor.\\nAre you looking for a professional\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0in your area?

Since VR headsets deliver audiovisual content, Lumen Optometric takes a look at whether or not VR headsets are bad for the eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow Do VR Headsets Work?\\nVR headsets are head-mounted devices that consist of a display screen and stereo earpieces, as well as sensors and controllers that create an interactive and immersive experience. Putting on a VR headset shuts out the immediate surroundings, which means the user can only see the content projected on the display screen. Its sensors adjust the content orientation, which allows the user to interact with a virtual space from any direction. While mostly known for their gaming applications, VR headsets can also be used for work and education.\\nThe Effects of VR on the Eyes\\nSimilar to devices that deliver audiovisual content like TVs and smartphones, VR headsets present the same risks, including eye strain and fatigue, discomfort, and blurred vision. Studies have shown that the human eye tends to blink less when using digital screens. Blinking helps remove contaminants from the eyes and keeps them moist and a reduced blink rate can result in dry eyes. The eyes also tend to work more as the brain tries to reconcile the differences between virtual and perceived depths.\\nVR headsets also induce visually-induced motion sickness in some people. This “cybersickness” can persist long after the user has stopped wearing the headset, the symptoms of which include headaches, lightheadedness, difficulty focusing, sweating, and nausea. People who are prone to motion sickness or already have problems that affect their depth perception are especially susceptible to cybersickness.\\nHow to Take Care of Your Eyes if You Use VR Headsets\\nFortunately, there are things that you can do to help reduce the effects of wearing VR headsets. The following can also be helpful if your daily routine involves prolonged use of digital screens:\\n\\n\\nFollow the “20/20/20 Rule”.\\xa0Take breaks from using your VR headset and follow the 20/20/20 rule: for every 20 minutes you spend looking at a screen, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\\n\\n\\nMoisturize your eyes.\\xa0In addition to taking regular breaks, apply eye drops to keep your eyes moist.\\n\\n\\nLimit your usage.\\xa0Don’t use the VR headset longer than you have to, particularly during late hours. In addition to eye strain, the constant exposure to blue light emitted by the screen can affect your body’s melatonin production and affect your sleep cycles.\\n\\n\\nLastly, visit your eye doctor regularly to prevent further eye problems. Lumen Optometric provides the best eye care services to clients in Sierra Madre, CA, and the surrounding communities in Los Angeles County.

In fact, they’re a component of your immune system that prevents infection, with tears containing water and salt to moisten your eyes as you blink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes, the glands under your eyelids may produce too many tears. When it discharges through your tear ducts, they become overwhelmed, resulting in watery eyes. This usually gets resolved without treatment, but if this is a recurring problem, refrain from wearing any\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0and have your eyes checked at a trusted eye center.\\nCommon Causes\\nNormally, you produce excess tears when you feel certain emotions, as well as when you laugh, vomit, cough, yawn, or experience strong taste sensations. However, in some cases, the cause for watery eyes can also be dry eye syndrome. With extremely dry eyes, you’re not able to receive proper lubrication and you’ll keep producing excess tears. This happens if your tears don’t contain the right balance of water, salt, and oils. Your eyes become irritated which causes the overproduction of tears to spill through your tear ducts.\\nKnowing When to See a Doctor\\nNormally, your watery eyes will clear up without any treatment. But if it keeps happening, you’ll have to see your trusted\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0for a check-up. They’ll be able to determine the cause of your dry eyes so they can administer the best treatment.\\nSometimes, the causes can be as simple as an injured or scratched eye. It can also be as obvious as swollen or red eyes. But other symptoms can also be tenderness around your nose or sinuses, as well as a severe headache associated with your watery eyes.\\nWhen you need a reliable specialist for\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0or other vision concerns, Lumen Optometric is the name you can trust.

Myopia is one of the most common vision issues among children, with 1 in 3 being myopic. It’s an epidemic that is projected to affect half of the world’s population by the year 2050. At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to give children better vision for life so they can accomplish their goals and avoid other serious vision problems in the future.\\nShort-Term Benefits of Myopia Treatment\\nSome of the short-term benefits of myopia treatment include increased confidence in your child, better vision to engage more actively in school and other activities, and an overall better quality of life.\\n1. Improved vision: Treehouse Eyes offers a holistic approach to myopia management.\\nSpecializing in treatment options for myopia, Treehouse Eyes doctors take into account a child’s background, genetics, and lifestyle. After evaluation, your child will receive proper treatment for myopia such as contact lenses or prescription eye drops.\\n2. Better academic performance: Children with myopia may often experience difficulty reading the board or seeing the screen in a classroom setting. It can also cause a lack of confidence to speak up in class because of their vision impairment. Treating myopia can help your child see clearly and give them the confidence to engage academically.\\n3. Reduce Eye Strain: Children with myopia may experience headaches and other symptoms from trying to focus on distant objects. Myopia treatment can help alleviate these symptoms for your child.\\n4. Increased quality of life: Treating myopia early on can help improve your child’s confidence by allowing them to participate in a wider range of activities. This can also help them excel at hobbies they currently struggle with due to their vision. Some studies show the relationship between myopia and mental health issues. Myopia management can lead to improved mental health and overall happiness for your child.\\nLong-term Benefits of Myopia Treatment\\nThere are numerous long-term benefits to treating myopia early on, which is where the Treehouse Eyes mission, “giving children better vision for life,” comes into play.\\n1. Reduce the risk of serious eye diseases: High myopia can lead to other serious eye diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachments, macular degeneration, and cataracts. Early intervention to treat myopia is key so your Treehouse Eyes doctor can greatly reduce those risks for your child.\\n2. More Career Prospects: Some careers may require good vision such as the military, aviation industry, surgeons and paramedics, or any rescue team such as a firefighter or a lifeguard. By slowing down the progression of myopia, your child will have a larger range of opportunities and won’t be held back by their myopia.\\n3. Lower healthcare costs: Treating myopia early might save your child higher vision care costs. Treatment of other eye diseases can be expensive, so the earlier myopia is treated, the less likely it could lead to an eye disease that is more serious.\\n4. Overall Improved Quality of Life: People with myopia may experience day-to-day difficulties with things such as difficulties driving, playing sports, or reading. Early intervention for myopia is key and can improve overall vision making daily activities easier and more enjoyable.\\nLet TreeHouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor.

The cornea (the clear outer surface of the eyes) of patients with astigmatism is shaped more like a football instead of a perfectly round ball (which is the ideal shape for your eyes). This irregular curve bends light more in one direction and causes blurry vision. Fortunately, moderate astigmatism can be easily corrected using toric contact lenses.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow are toric lenses different from normal contact lenses? Lumen Optometric, your trusted\\xa0scleral optometrist, elaborates on the key features of toric lenses below:\\xa0\\n\\nHow the Shape of Toric Lenses Is Different\\n\\nNormal contacts have are spherical-shaped whereas toric lenses are shaped like the side of a donut. Thanks to this unique shape, toric lenses have different refractive powers that can correct astigmatism. They also have a small weight in their edges make sure your contacts return to their proper alignment after you blink. (Whenever you blink, the contacts on your eye rotate.)\\xa0\\n\\nWhy It’s Important That Your Toric Contacts Fit Well\\n\\nIt’s important that your contacts fit properly, but it’s especially so for toric lenses. That’s because ill-fitting toric lenses that slip easily won’t be able to improve the clarity of your vision.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat Are the Different Types of Toric Lenses?\\xa0\\n\\nToric lenses are either made of soft or hard (also known as rigid gas permeable) lenses. Soft lenses are comfortable to wear, but hard lenses—which are more likely to stay in place—tend to perform better than soft lenses. However, it usually takes a longer time to adjust to hard lenses. If you want to learn more about toric lenses as well as other treatment options, like\\xa0neurolens treatment, for other vision conditions, consult your eye doctor.\\xa0\\n\\nLooking for eye specialists near you?\\xa0\\n\\nLumen Optometric, a family-owned practice, offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including toric lens fitting and\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0services.

If you have plans with your soon-to-be spouse, know that you don’t have to ditch your spectacles, especially if they are what makes you distinct in terms of personality. Here are some pieces of advice from Lumen Optometric to help you get the most out of the look on your wedding day.\\n\\n\\nMake Your Glasses a Statement Piece\\nYou won’t be hard-pressed to find a stylish set of frames nowadays. In addition to vision correction, they can help enhance your appearance, especially when you wear your wedding outfit. If you are getting a new pair before your big day, be sure that you treat it like jewelry. In other words, it should complement your dress or suit.\\nSchedule a Custom Fitting\\nDon’t go for the first frames you see right from the shelf. Schedule a custom fitting with your future spouse so you can find the perfect pair of eyeglasses that will match the style you’re looking for. Your\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0can help you choose which frames suit you best, taking note of the shape and other details of your face as a guide. You’ll want them to be of the perfect size and fit, so you can wear them from the wedding ceremony at church to the reception venue.\\nMinimize the Glare\\nIt’s one thing to get the perfect frame size and style, but it’s also another thing to get the best prescription possible for vision correction. Your current prescription may no longer work for you, and your next visit to your eye doctor is essential for determining whether you need a new one. While you’re at it, why not ask about anti-reflective options? Expect many photo ops at the wedding march and the reception, so lenses with this feature are a must-have for your new specs.\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we want to make sure that you will get the best pair of eyewear possible that fits this important occasion. Apart from this, you can count on us to provide other exceptional eye care services, including neurolens therapy and\\xa0corneal reshaping. Call us now at (626) 921-0199, or fill out our\\xa0contact form\\xa0to book an appointment with us.\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Tagged With: eye doctor, eye glasses, eye healthPrimary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

That’s why it’s important that your contacts fit your eyes properly.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe problem is that some diseases and conditions can make contact lens fitting harder. Lumen Optometric, your trusted\\xa0scleral optometrist, gives an overview below: \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nDry eye\\xa0– The surface of your eye needs to stay moist. Without sufficient lubrication and moisture, the surface of your eye becomes more vulnerable to inflammation. Wearing contacts can also exacerbate issues related to dry eyes. That’s because the lack of lubrication increases the friction between the eyes and contacts, increasing discomfort for lens wearers. Using artificial tears can help alleviate symptoms of dry eye. However, certain formulations work better than others. That’s why if you need\\xa0dry eye treatment, it’s best to consult your local eye doctor.\\xa0Keratoconus\\xa0– This is a progressive disease that causes corneas (the outer layer at the front of your eye that’s responsible for focusing light) to become thinner and bulge outward into a cone shape. The cornea’s irregular shape distorts a patient’s vision and makes fitting contacts harder.\\xa0\\nDoes This Mean Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes Still Wear Contacts?\\xa0\\nPatients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes need to wear custom-molded scleral lenses, which are larger than gas permeable contact lenses. Thanks to their large size, they can cover the entire corneal surface. Since scleral lenses rest on the less sensitive part of the sclera or the white outer layer of the eye, patients with \\xa0Keratoconus don’t usually experience discomfort when using them.\\xa0\\nLumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including scleral lens fitting and\\xa0neurolens treatment\\xa0services.

Not really. When you analyze the causes of myopia, it becomes clear why more and more children are becoming affected by this progressive eye disease.\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Myopia?\\nMyopia, often referred to as nearsightedness, is an eye disease in which the eye elongates more than it should, causing light to be focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina’s surface. Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long.\\nBecause the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia.\\nThe hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night.\\nWhat Causes Myopia?\\nSeveral factors lead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status.\\nGenetics\\nA child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or your spouse are myopic.\\nExcessive ‘Near Work’\\nMore than ever before, kids all over the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day, whether reading a book, using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or another device.\\nNumerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially in excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and progression of myopia.\\nSome findings suggest that the intensity and duration of near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating novel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a magazine a few minutes at a time.\\nNot Enough Outdoor Time\\nSpending at least 2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia!\\nOther Risk Factors Associated with Myopia\\nHeight — taller children and adolescents have a higher incidence of myopia than their shorter counterpartsEducation level — There is a higher incidence of myopia in people with advanced degrees, as well as higher parental education levels.Ethnicity — Individuals from Asian/Pacific Islander communities are more at risk of developing myopia.\\nIf Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help!\\nWhat many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood.\\nThe good news is that myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease. At Treehouse Eyes, we offer the latest and most effective myopia management treatments to limit the progression of myopia so that your child can live his or her best life.\\nCheck out real stories from satisfied parents and children sharing their experiences with our professional doctors, staff, and myopia treatment protocols at Treehouse Eyes.\\nPrevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling your child’s myopia consultation today.

Since you’ll only be seeing your eye doctor once a year, you need to make the most of it. That includes asking the important questions pertaining to the current state of your eyesight. Lumen Optometric lists some of them below.\\n\\n\\n“Are My Eyes Healthy?”\\nIf your doctor detects a disease during the eye exam such as age-related macular degeneration or glaucoma, they will educate you thoroughly and advise you how to safeguard your eyes. However, even if you haven’t been diagnosed with such, it’s best to prioritize your wellness, especially when it comes to your vision. Be sure to ask your doctor if there are ways to improve your vision and ocular health. They will be able to present you with options to retain your healthy eyesight.\\n“Are There Any Changes I Should Do to Protect My Eyes?”\\nSeveral eye diseases have been linked to UV exposure, from cataracts to eye cancers. Sunglasses can prevent these issues, but your eye doctor may recommend UV-blocking contact lenses to block the peripheral light that sunglasses cannot block. If you are already wearing a contact lens, you can replace your lenses as prescribed by your doctor.\\n“Are Digital Devices Affecting My Eyesight?”\\nMore than 83% of Americans use digital devices for more than two hours each day, which can lead to digital eye strain. Common symptoms include eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes. During the eye exam, your eye doctor can suggest several tips to alleviate digital eye strain. These may include offering\\xa0dry eye treatment, changing the lighting and display settings, or wearing specialized prescriptions, including contact lenses.\\n“When Should I Return for My Next Visit?”\\nDepending on your age, vision, and medical history, your eye doctor will determine how often you need an exam. Staying on schedule is crucial, especially if you have underlying eye conditions that need to be treated. Most eye care centers may schedule your next appointment right away. Otherwise, be sure to set a reminder on your phone.\\xa0\\nHere at Lumen Optometric, our eye care professionals are happy to assist you with your eye health concerns. We also provide top-quality eye care services, including\\xa0neurolens treatment\\xa0and more.

Myopia control treatments are\\nnow able to improve children’s vision and promote long-term eye health. Read\\non to find out more!\\n\\n\\nWhat is Myopia?\\nPeople with myopia have blurred vision when looking at objects from a\\ndistance. When myopia worsens, the blur can become noticeable even when\\nthe object is close to or at arm’s length. Near-sightedness or\\nshort-sightedness are other names for it.\\nMyopia usually begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 14 and generally\\nbecomes progressively worse every several months in children. It results from\\nthe eyes’ rapid and excessive expansion relative to the usual pace of eye\\ngrowth. The eyes should continue to expand consistently in size until\\nadolescence, then stabilize. However, with myopia, the eyes develop too\\nquickly, causing rapid and continuous vision loss as well as ongoing eye\\ngrowth into adolescence and even early adulthood. Myopia progression is the\\nterm used to describe this continuing deterioration.\\nWhat is Myopia Control?\\nThe use of treatments intended to stop the advancement of myopia is known\\nas “myopia control.” These treatments include atropine eye drops, soft contact\\nlenses, ortho-k, and special types of glasses. Myopia control is especially\\ncrucial for children, as it is in this age group that myopia is most likely to\\nprogress or worsen quickly.\\nBoth myopia management and myopia control are phrases used to refer to the\\nadditional clinical care needed for myopic children and adults. Myopia control\\ntypically entails using eye drops, contacts, or glasses to stop the progression\\nof myopia. Myopia control is a broad term that encompasses maintaining eye\\nhealth as well as various lifestyle and environmental factors that may\\ncontribute to the advancement of myopia.\\nWhat are The Advantages of Myopia Control?\\nThe primary advantage of treating myopia is to reduce the risks associated\\nwith high myopia. Those with high degrees of myopia will have increased risk\\nfor diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachments, and myopic\\nmaculopathy.\\nMyopia requires the use of spectacles or contact lenses to treat blurry\\ndistance vision. If your myopia is lower, you will be more functional in the\\nmornings before putting on your contacts or glasses. You’ll be able to work a\\nlittle better without them as opposed to becoming totally incapacitated without\\nthem.\\nAdditionally, a lower prescription increases the likelihood that your child will be\\na good candidate for laser eye surgery as an adult to correct their myopia, as\\nwell as the likelihood that they will have better visual results after surgery.\\nWhat Else Should I know?\\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that a child’s or teen’s visual\\nenvironment can raise their chances of developing and progressing myopia.\\nWhen creating the visual environment, do increase the duration of outdoor\\ntime your child has. Talk to your eye doctor or optometrist about the ideal\\nduration they should spend outdoors and on screens and/or reading to control\\nyour child’s myopia. These can play a significant role in ensuring the optimum\\nresults from myopia control treatments.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment\\nplans for your child. Our treatment plans include special prescription eye drops and\\ncustomized daytime and overnight contact lenses. Treehouse Eyes doctors determine\\nwhich treatment plan works the best for your child at your initial consultation.

Always be careful when participating in activities that involve sharp items and flying objects. One way to ensure your eyes are safe while you’re playing sports is wearing the proper safety eyewear. Keep in mind that conventional glasses won’t give your eyes the protection they need.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nA local\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0shares facts about sports eye safety.\\xa0\\nBlinding Injuries Can Occur From Combat Sports\\nPeople participating in boxing and full-contact martial arts are at significant risk of severe eye injuries that can lead to blindness. While there’s no standard eye protection for boxing, using thumbless gloves can help reduce eye injuries related to the sport.\\xa0\\nBasketball Is the Leading Cause of Sports-Related Injuries\\nMost sports-related eye injuries in the U.S. occur while playing basketball. It is followed by softball, baseball, airsoft rifles, pellet guns, racquetball and hockey. When playing these sports, you must wear protective glasses with shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses.

At Lumen Optometric, we’re here to help choose which glasses or\\xa0contact lenses\\xa0are most suitable for your activity.\\xa0\\nConsider Your Risks\\nIf one of your eyes already has reduced vision, think hard before participating in a sport with a high risk of eye injury.

This is especially bad when the person has ocular misalignment, allowing for a condition termed trigeminal dysphoria. The premier\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0specialist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares more details about trigeminal dysphoria and how you can alleviate its symptoms.\\n\\n\\nWho is At-Risk of Trigeminal Dysphoria?\\nPeople who experience trigeminal dysphoria–about 90% of them, in fact, according to studies–have ocular misalignment when viewing nearby objects instead of at a distance. This means their regular and continued use of digital devices becomes even more problematic since the task involves full-on near vision. To compensate for this problem, their vision must work overtime. This, in turn, puts a strain on the trigeminal nerve–the largest and most complex nerve connected to the brain. When the trigeminal nerve is triggered, these allow for symptoms that include headaches, eye strain, light sensitivity, and neck and shoulder pain.\\nHow Do You Confirm You Have Trigeminal Dysphoria?\\nThe symptoms mentioned above are also associated with a number of eye conditions. To determine whether you actually have trigeminal dysphoria, you should visit a trusted local\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0like Lumen Optometric. Our trained and skilled eye care specialists will perform a comprehensive checkup of your eyes and accurately determine the root of its problem. If the results are indeed trigeminal dysphoria, we can offer a safe and effective way to alleviate its symptoms.\\nWhat is Neurolens Treatment Technology?\\nLumen Optometric is the only neurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley. With the use of advanced and customized lenses, we can correct your specific ocular misalignment so you won’t have to struggle to see up close or far away. This means a reduced potential for symptoms involved with trigeminal dysphoria, allowing only for the most comfortable vision possible.\\xa0\\nNeurolens utilizes different technology to conventional\\xa0contact lenses. To ensure you get the specialized lenses that can perfectly fit your eyes and help with your specific symptoms, Lumen Optometric will measure your eye misalignment using sophisticated equipment, SightSync. You’ll start noticing vision improvements with neuronlens within the week–those with extremely chronic conditions, however, may require at least six weeks before they can see the difference.\\nLumen Optometric is your go-to specialist for safe and effective alleviation of trigeminal dysphoria symptoms. We proudly serve Sierra Madre, CA and the rest of San Gabriel Valley.

There could be multiple reasons, from environmental factors to something more serious. Read on to learn more about dry eyes, including the main causes and treatment options.\\n\\n\\nMain Causes of Dry Eyes\\nSeveral factors can contribute to dry eyes:\\n\\n\\nAging.\\xa0With age, our tear production naturally decreases. This is why people over 50 are more likely to experience dry eye symptoms.\\n\\n\\nGender.\\xa0Hormonal changes, particularly during pregnancy, using oral contraceptives or menopause, can cause dry eyes in women.\\n\\n\\nEnvironmental Conditions.\\xa0Dry, windy, smoky or dusty conditions can increase tear evaporation. Also, spending long hours looking at the computer screen can reduce the blink rate, drying your eyes out.\\n\\n\\nMedications.\\xa0Certain drugs, including antihistamines, decongestants, blood pressure medications and antidepressants, can reduce tear production.\\n\\n\\nHealth Conditions.\\xa0Certain health issues can cause dry eyes, such as Sjogren’s syndrome, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid problems.\\n\\n\\nHow to Treat Dry Eyes\\nTreatment for dry eyes typically aims at restoring or maintaining the normal amount of tears in the eye to minimize dryness and related discomfort. Here are some of the most common:\\n\\n\\nArtificial Tears.\\xa0Over-the-counter eye drops that mimic your natural tears may relieve mild cases of dry eyes.\\n\\n\\nLifestyle Changes.\\xa0Taking breaks during long tasks, avoiding air blowing in your eyes and adding moisture to the air at home or work can help.\\n\\n\\nPrescription Medications.\\xa0Certain prescription drugs can help increase tear production.\\n\\n\\nSpecial Procedures.\\xa0In severe cases, various procedures can be used, like closing your tear ducts to reduce tear loss or using special contact lenses.\\n\\n\\nIf you’ve tried home care methods and over-the-counter solutions without success, it’s time to see a doctor. Seek immediate medical attention if you have:\\n\\n\\nUnbearable eye discomfort\\n\\n\\nA significant decrease in vision\\n\\n\\nOther symptoms like redness, swelling or discharge\\n\\n\\nDry Eye Treatment at Lumen Optometric\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we understand that every individual is unique.

Some get nose pain and marks, while others feel eye strain or ear pain. To avoid these issues when getting new glasses or\\xa0contact lenses, it is important to work with a reliable eye care professional.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHere are possible reasons your new eyeglasses might be uncomfortable to wear. \\xa0\\xa0\\nYour Eyeglasses Are Loose\\nIf your eyeglasses feel like they are falling every time you move, it could be that they are too loose around your ears. You can try to run your glasses under warm water and slightly bend the temple arms down. Another solution is to get eyeglasses in smaller frames that best fit your face shape.\\xa0\\nYou Have a Low Nose Bridge\\nYou may have a low nose bridge if your eyeglasses slip down when you tilt your head. If this is the case, you may need the help of your\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0to find glasses that are suitable for lower nose bridges. They may suggest getting rectangular or horn-rimmed glasses. Moreover, you can also try adjusting the nose pads of your glasses inward, so they sit more securely to your nose.\\xa0\\nYour Glasses Are Not Set Correctly\\nWhen glasses leave marks on your nose bridge, it could be that they are not set correctly. It is easy to adjust the nose pads of your glasses, so they sit on your nose properly. Your optician may also adjust them or change them with another material, such as silicone, acetate, or nylon. If you have a plastic frame, it’s possible that they are too heavy or the bridge may not be big enough. You may want to consider investing in eyeglass frames with a wider bridge or lighter-weight lenses.\\xa0\\nIncorrect Pupillary Distance Measurement\\nYou may still get headaches from properly sized eyeglasses if it has an incorrect pupillary distance (PD) measurement. PD refers to the distance between your pupils and is necessary for eyeglass wear comfort. Mistakes on PD are common for people who get their prescription glasses. \\xa0\\nLumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care needs. Besides glasses and contacts, we also offer neuro lens and\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0therapy.

Usually, you won’t notice significant changes in your vision until your 40s. It isn’t uncommon for older adults to experience difficulty in reading small print or need more light to see clearly. Learn why it happens from a local\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0specialist.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAging Eyes: Why Do They Need More Light?\\nIn your 40s, the lenses of your eyes can start to turn yellow and get more rigid. It can reduce the amount of light that enters your eyes and affect color accuracy and focus. As you age, your corneas can thicken and become more opaque. Your pupils can also begin to shrink. These changes can further decrease and diffuse the light that reaches your eyes.\\xa0\\nIndividuals who are 65 and older might need more light to see clearly. Their eyes might take longer to adjust from light to dark environments and vice versa. It can be more challenging for older adults to focus on nearby objects. They can also experience sensitivity to glare.\\nTips to Help You Adjust to Vision Changes\\xa0\\nSee Your Eye Doctor Regularly\\nRegardless of age, you must see an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0regularly. Doing so helps in detecting and treating vision-threatening conditions in their early stages. Macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the most common eye problems in older adults. They don’t usually show early signs, and you might not know you have them until they have progressed.\\xa0\\nMake Necessary Changes to Your Home\\nPeople who are 65 and older often need twice as much light as young adults to see well. You can make your living space safer by increasing ambient light. Consider adding dimmer switches so each family member can easily adjust the room’s illumination depending on their needs. Place task lighting wherever they are necessary. It’s also essential that light switches are easy to access.\\xa0\\nDon’t wait for your vision to change before seeing an eye doctor. For personalized eye care services, turn to Lumen Optometric. Besides providing eyeglasses and\\xa0contact lenses, we specialize in orthokeratology and neurolens therapy.\\xa0Call us at\\xa0(626) 921-0199\\xa0or complete our\\xa0online form\\xa0to schedule an appointment.\\n\\n\\n\\nFiled Under: eye care Tagged With: eye care, eye doctor, eye examsPrimary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

As another year unfolds, people usually start listing habits they want to begin and ones they wish to quit. In your New Year’s resolutions, it would be great if you could include things that can help with your vision and eye health. For instance, seeing an\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0regularly.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s what you can include in your vision and eye health resolutions for 2022. \\xa0\\n\\nReducing Screen Time\\nToday, people spend more time on screens than ever before. However, excessive screen time can be detrimental to your eyes. It can increase your risk of developing dry eye syndrome, a condition that can cause your eyes to become red, dry, and itchy. If you have a job that requires you to use the computer for hours, make sure to give your eyes a break every once in a while.\\xa0\\n\\nPractice Healthy Contact Lens Wear\\nContact lenses are a great option for people who don’t prefer to wear glasses. Using contacts is safe as long you practice good hygiene, wear them properly, and follow your eye doctor’s recommendations. You should avoid wearing contacts for extended periods, reusing old solution, and handling lenses without washing your hands.\\xa0\\n\\nAvoid Constant Eye Rubbing\\nWhile it may be tempting to rub your eyes when they are itchy, you shouldn’t. Doing so will only worsen the problem and put too much pressure on your eyes or even scratch them. You can use a cold compress if your eyes keep itching. If it feels like there’s something inside your eye, gently flush it with water. However, if the sensation persists, it’s best to see your eye doctor.\\xa0\\n\\nWear Proper Eye Protection\\nThe sun’s ultraviolet rays can be extremely harmful to your eyes. When going outside, make sure to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Moreover, use protective eyewear when swimming, cooking with oil, doing home improvements, and other activities that risk eye injuries or involve chemicals.\\xa0\\n\\nFor your eye care needs, Lumen Optometric is more than happy to help. We specialize in myopia treatment,\\xa0corneal reshaping\\xa0therapy, and more!

Prolonged screen time can overwork your eyes and lead to eye strain, but the good news is that there are simple exercises that can help relax and refresh your eyes. Lumen Optometric, your go-to provider of\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0and other eye care solutions, shares five exercises that are specifically designed to minimize eye discomfort.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEye Strain Explained\\nAlso known as asthenopia, eye strain is a common condition characterized by discomfort in and around the eyes. These are often caused by activities requiring intense use of the eyes, such as reading, driving, or screen time, and the usual symptoms include dryness, redness, blurred vision, light sensitivity, and headaches. When you constantly fix your gaze on digital screens, your eyes have to incessantly focus and refocus, causing eye strain.\\nExercises To Prevent Eye Strain\\nThe following simple exercises can significantly reduce eye strain when incorporated into your daily routine:\\n\\n\\nThe 20-20-20 Rule.\\xa0Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away. This technique allows your eyes to rest from the intensity of the computer or smartphone screen.\\n\\n\\nBlinking.\\xa0This refreshes and moistens your eyes, which can prevent dryness and irritation.\\n\\n\\nPalming.\\xa0Rub your palms together to warm them, then place them gently over your closed eyes. Feel your eyes relax while you breathe deeply.\\n\\n\\nEye-Rolling.\\xa0Close your eyes and roll them gently in a circular motion. This helps to relieve tension around the eyes.\\n\\n\\nFocusing Exercises.\\xa0Hold your thumb six inches away from your face and focus on it for five seconds. Then, focus on an object 20 feet away for another five seconds. Switch back and forth. This exercise helps train your eyes.\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Professional Eye Care\\nWhile these eye exercises can help prevent eye strain, it’s equally important to have regular, comprehensive eye checks done by an\\xa0eye exam doctor. These exams will help in the early identification of any potential eye-related issues.\\nLet Lumen Optometric Take Care of Your Vision\\nEye strain is a widespread issue, but the good news is that it can be managed effectively through regular exercises and professional eye care. For top-notch eye care solutions, turn to the best in Sierra Madre, California.\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we’ve got you covered, from orthokeratology to top-quality\\xa0contact lenses.

Unfortunately, it also brings factors that can affect your eye health and vision. Understanding these factors can help you protect your eyesight and enjoy all winter offers without worry or discomfort.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComplications of Cold Weather on Eye Health\\nDuring colder temperatures, your eyes may suffer several complications that warrant an\\xa0eye exam.\\n\\n\\nDry Eyes:\\xa0The cold weather often reduces the amount of moisture in the air, resulting in dry eyes for many people. Due to reduced humidity levels inside homes or offices and increased wind speeds, it can be difficult for tears to form normally. This can lead to irritation, redness, itching and burning sensations around the eyes that may cause further complications if left untreated.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWind and Dust:\\xa0During colder temperatures, wind gusts are much stronger than usual, which increases dust particles being blown into our eyes. This can cause irritation and potential damage to sensitive structures within our ocular areas, such as the conjunctiva (the white part) or cornea (the clear front layer).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSun Glare:\\xa0With sun glare reflecting off ice crystals in the sky combined with strong winds blowing snowflakes across areas where there should be little obstruction from sunlight, there is an increased risk for UV exposure. This can cause temporary issues such as headaches and long-term damage, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), over prolonged periods if protection isn’t taken seriously.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPrevention Tips for Eye Health in Winter\\nHere’s what you can do to protect your eyes from the cold:\\n\\n\\nWear Protective Eyewear: Wearing protective eyewear will help reduce exposure levels significantly while allowing us to see better under harsh conditions. Protective eyewear contains polarized lenses providing clearer images even when light reflects off surfaces like bodies of water or icy grounds. \\xa0We recommend investing in quality frames/lenses designed against UV radiation to keep your vision intact.\\n\\n\\nHydrate: We suggest drinking plenty of fluids throughout days spent outdoors this season, not only because staying hydrated helps fight dryness caused by winds but also because a lack thereof could lead to negative impacts.\\n\\n\\nTake Breaks from Screens: Staring at screens for prolonged periods can cause eyestrain and fatigue, leading to redness, itchiness, dry eyes and other complications. Taking regular breaks from any digital device, especially when wearing\\xa0contact lenses, \\xa0helps give your eyes a break so they can rest and recuperate more effectively.\\n\\n\\nEat Nutritious Foods: Eating nutritious foods rich in vitamins and minerals, such as dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes and oily fish, is important because these substances can help strengthen eye structures against external factors like dryness and wind. They provide nutrients that benefit long-term vision health, reducing risks associated with certain conditions, including AMD (age-related macular degeneration) and cataracts.\\n\\n\\nVisit an eye exam doctor: If you are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned above or if you have any questions about how to protect your eyes during winter, consult an eye doctor.\\n\\n\\nNeed more information on eye health?

This popular festival is a time for silly costumes, eerie décor, and, of course, delicious goodies. Nevertheless, many people are unaware that October is also Halloween Eye Health and Safety Month, a wonderful time to highlight the need to protect your vision during this festive season.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAt Treehouse Eyes, we believe in preserving your child’s eyesight all year round, ensuring better vision for life. In this blog post, we’ll explore some simple yet effective ways to protect your eyes and ensure a safe and enjoyable Halloween celebration.\\nChoose the Right Costume Accessories:\\nOne of the most fun elements of Halloween is dressing up in unique costumes. Yet, certain costume accessories might be hazardous to your eyes. While choosing masks, headgear, and other accessories, use caution. Check that they fit comfortably and do not block your view. Be sure to try and use outfits with transparent, non-toxic face paint or cosmetics.\\nBeware of Decorative Contact Lenses:\\nColored or decorative contact lenses are a popular choice for enhancing Halloween costumes, but they can be dangerous if not worn properly. Only a qualified eye care provider with a valid prescription should be able to get these lenses. To avoid eye infections, never exchange contact lenses with others and adhere to the prescribed cleaning and wearing schedule.\\nMind the Makeup:\\nMakeup is an important aspect of many Halloween outfits, but be cautious when applying it around your eyes. Use hypoallergenic makeup and avoid applying makeup inside the lash line or straight onto the eyeball for cosmetics safety. To avoid eye discomfort and infection, always remove your makeup before going to bed.\\nTalk to your Eye Doctor:\\nDo you have any questions about what not to wear on Halloween? Are you looking for fun contacts to tske your costume over the top? Trust your eye doctor to answer any questions you have.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\n\\xa0\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child. Our treatment plans include special prescription eye drops and customized daytime and overnight contact lenses. Treehouse Eyes doctors determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at your initial consultation.

It involves damage to the macula, or the part of your eye responsible for sharp, central vision. Symptoms may range from blurred or reduced central vision to distorted vision.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAMD may sound scary, but did you know your diet can help significantly manage and prevent it from occurring? In this article, Lumen Optometric discusses how your meal choices can help prevent this eye condition.\\xa0\\nThe Role of Diet in AMD\\nWhen it comes to AMD, it’s fascinating how far-reaching the impact of your diet can be. Certain nutrients, like Omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and vitamins C and E, benefit eye health. These nutrients contribute to maintaining the health of your retina and can be found in foods like leafy greens, fish, and fruits.\\n\\nHere are some recommended foods to eat to ensure a healthy eyesight and lower your chances of getting diagnosed with AMD:\\n\\n\\n\\nLeafy green vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and collard greens;\\n\\n\\nFish and seafood, especially oily varieties like salmon, tuna, and sardines;\\n\\n\\nBeets, sweet potatoes, and carrots;\\n\\n\\nNuts, especially almonds and walnuts;\\n\\n\\nEggs;\\n\\n\\nCitrus fruits and other fruits, like apples, bananas, strawberries, kiwis, and grapefruit;\\n\\n\\nFruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin C, such as oranges, peppers, and broccoli;\\n\\n\\nWhole grains, like oats, quinoa, and brown rice;\\n\\n\\nLegumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas;\\n\\n\\nDairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese;\\n\\n\\nFoods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, such as chia seeds, flaxseed, and soybeans; and\\n\\n\\nFoods high in zinc include oysters, red meat, and fortified cereals.\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Regular Eye Exams\\nAn optometrist can be instrumental in helping prevent or manage AMD. Their specialization allows them to detect early signs of AMD, provide appropriate treatments, and guide you on necessary lifestyle changes.

Pediatric eye exams can detect vision problems early and help children develop the skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. A\\xa0scleral optometrist\\xa0discusses the ideal schedule for pediatric eye exams here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Is a Pediatric Eye Exam?\\nA pediatric eye exam is a comprehensive assessment of your child’s eyesight. During the appointment, an optometrist will evaluate how well your child can see from near and far distances, their peripheral vision and depth perception, and any underlying conditions or diseases that could affect their vision.\\xa0\\nHow Often Should Pediatric Eye Exams Be Scheduled?\\nThe American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that all children receive comprehensive pediatric eye examinations at least once between the ages of 3 to 5 years old, followed by yearly checkups until age 18 (or 21 if still in school).\\xa0\\nHowever, certain risk factors may increase the frequency with which these appointments should occur. Issues such as premature birth or family history of ocular diseases, like glaucoma, cataracts, retinopathy, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, strabismus (crossed-eyes) and uncorrected refractive error, may make your child prone to certain eye health problems. Even dry eye, a natural part of aging, affect children and require them to undergo\\xa0dry eye treatment.\\nIn these cases, it’s best to consult your optometrist, who will create an individualized plan based on your needs and risk factors in your family history and medical records.\\nWhat To Expect During An Eye Exam\\nWhen you bring your little one for an eye exam, the doctor will conduct various tests to assess their eyes’ health and function. These tests may include:\\n\\n\\nVisual acuity test\\xa0– This measures how your child can see at different distances.\\n\\n\\nRefraction test\\xa0– An examination to determine whether corrective lenses are needed for optimal vision.\\n\\n\\nColor blindness test\\xa0– A simple screening tool that checks for color deficiencies.\\n\\n\\nSlit lamp exam\\xa0– Used to check for any signs of infection or damage on the eye’s surface.\\n\\n\\nRetinoscopy/autorefractor\\xa0– A method doctors use to measure refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism.\\n\\n\\nIf you’re looking for a comprehensive pediatric eye exam in Sierra Madre, CA, look no further than Lumen Optometric. Our team of experienced optometrists will work with you to ensure that your child’s vision is healthy and they’re seeing their best. We offer several services, including\\xa0neurolens treatment, to ensure you and your child’s eyes are in optimal health.\\xa0Schedule an appointment\\xa0today!

Perhaps they have been struggling to see things clearly from a distance. If so, they might be experiencing a common vision problem known as myopia or nearsightedness.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlarmingly, studies show that childhood myopia rates are on the rise globally. Read on as Lumen Optometric shares crucial insights into this escalating issue, its impact on children’s vision, and how early detection and treatment can make all the difference.\\xa0\\nUnderstanding Myopia\\nMyopia, often known as nearsightedness, is a condition where objects up close are seen clearly, while objects farther away appear blurred. Usually developing in childhood, myopia occurs when the eye grows too long, preventing light from focusing directly on the retina. This irregularity causes distant objects to appear blurry, which could mean your child is struggling to see the school board or having difficulty playing sports.\\xa0\\nHow an Eye Exam Doctor Can Help Detect Myopia\\nAn\\xa0eye exam doctor\\xa0plays a critical role in the early detection of myopia. During your child’s regular eye exams, they can accurately measure your child’s vision and eye health, diagnosing myopia and other potential vision problems. Remember, early intervention can prevent your child’s eyesight issues from worsening.\\nTreatment Options for Childhood Myopia\\nOnce diagnosed, effective treatment options are available. One common approach is to prescribe\\xa0contact lenses. These are usually worn during the day and removed at night, aiding in clear distant vision.\\n\\xa0\\nAnother advanced treatment option is\\xa0orthokeratology, a non-surgical procedure that gradually reshapes the eye’s curvature using specially designed contact lenses. One advantage of this process is that it slows down the progression of myopia in children, providing a more long-term solution.\\xa0\\nHow Lumen Optometric Can Help\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we’re dedicated to providing comprehensive eye care for your child. Based in Sierra Madre, CA, our team of eye doctors has the expertise to diagnose and treat myopia in children. Rest assured that we use the latest techniques, such as orthokeratology, to ensure optimal results and safeguard your child’s vision for the future.\\n\\nTo schedule an appointment, call us today at\\xa0(626) 921-0199, or fill out our\\xa0contact form.\\n\\n\\n\\nFiled Under: eye health Tagged With: eye exam doctor, myopia, myopia controlPrimary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

Eye safety hazards during sports can range from minor scratches to severe trauma that can cause permanent vision loss. Choosing the right sports eye safety gear is crucial to protect your eyes from potential harm. In this article, we explore the different types of sports eye safety gear available and how to choose the right one for your needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentifying Your Needs\\nWhen choosing the right sports eyewear, it is important to consider the type of sport you are playing and the level of intensity. For instance, you may need different protection for a non-contact or low-intensity sport like golf than for a full-contact team sport like football. Choosing the appropriate eye protection will help protect your eyes while allowing you to play comfortably and safely.\\xa0\\nFeatures to Consider\\nWhen selecting the right sports eye safety gear, these are the features you should consider.\\xa0\\nFit\\nRegardless of the type of activity you’re participating in, your eye doctor will recommend choosing eyewear that fits. Your eye gear should fit snugly and comfortably without slipping or moving during activity. Look for eyewear with adjustable straps or nose pads to ensure a proper fit.\\nComfort\\nYour eyewear should also be comfortable to wear for extended periods. Look for soft padding or cushioning around the eyes. Lightweight materials that won’t bother you during activity are also excellent choices.\\nDurability\\nSports eye safety gear should withstand impact and other potential hazards. Look for durable materials that can withstand rough handling. Polycarbonate lenses or frames made from strong plastics or metals work great for this purpose.\\nVisibility\\nChoose sports eye safety gear that doesn’t impede your vision. It should also provide you with a wide field of vision and have anti-fog coatings, so you can see clearly during activity. Additionally, it may be worth investing in impact-resistant lenses if you play contact sports. They absorb shock better than regular ones but still provide clear visibility even under extreme conditions. \\xa0\\nLens Tint\\nThe tint of the lens is also an important consideration as it can affect your vision in different lighting conditions. Clear lenses suit low-light conditions, while tinted or polarized lenses can reduce glare and improve visibility in bright sunlight.\\nShopping Tips\\nOnce you have identified your needs, research different brands and read customer reviews to compare features and quality. It is also worth asking for recommendations from friends or family who play the same sport.\\xa0If you’re looking for\\xa0eye exam doctors\\xa0or\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0or optometry specialists in Sierra Madre, CA, to help you pick the right eyewear for your preferred sport, Lumen Optometric\\xa0can help.\\xa0Contact us\\xa0at\\xa0(626) 921-0199\\xa0today to get a consultation!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiled Under: eye safety Tagged With: contact lenses, eye exam doctor, orthokeratologyPrimary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

It develops when the eyeball grows longer from front to back than normal, with the symptom of blurry distance vision. Myopia tends to begin in childhood and worsen over time. This leads many to wonder – is nearsightedness genetic? Let’s explore the evidence surrounding myopia’s hereditary patterns.\\n\\nResearch Shows a Strong Genetic Link\\nExtensive research, including twin studies, family patterns, and genetic mapping, provides compelling evidence that genetics play a significant role in myopia. While environmental factors can also influence myopia risk, the hereditary component cannot be ignored.\\nSpecific genetic variations affecting eye growth, development, and refraction have been identified that predispose people to nearsightedness. These genes often relate to connective tissues, neurotransmitters, and intracellular signaling. However, experts note there are likely numerous genes involved in determining myopia susceptibility and that environmental factors do play a role.\\nOverall, studies show parents who are nearsighted have a greater chance of passing myopia on to their children. The odds also increase if both parents are nearsighted. The precise risk depends on the severity of parental myopia as well as environmental exposures.\\nEthnic patterns also demonstrate a genetic link. Asian countries, for example, have a much higher rate of myopia than European countries or the United States.\\nWhile genetics play a key role, lifestyle and environmental factors fine-tune how these predispositions manifest. But the bottom line is clear – nearsightedness has a powerful hereditary component overall.\\nMyopia Progression in Children\\nSince myopia most often develops and worsens during childhood, this is the period when genetic risk is most influential. Children with one or more myopic parents need close monitoring as their eyes continue to grow and develop refractive errors.\\nRapid myopia progression is especially common between ages 8-15. This is a critical time when interventions can help safeguard a child’s eyesight and offset inherited risks. Implementing myopia control techniques at younger ages appears to have the greatest impact on slowing progression long-term.\\nThe complex interplay between hereditary susceptibility and environmental exposures determines if and when myopia manifests and progresses in children. However, identifying and addressing genetic predispositions early helps preserve vision potential.\\nWarning Signs of Myopia Onset in Children\\nFor children with a family history of nearsightedness, be vigilant about the following signs that may indicate myopia onset:\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSquinting or eye-rubbing\\nDifficulty seeing the board at school\\nAvoiding reading/close work\\nHeadaches after visual tasks\\nSitting very close to the TV\\nTilting head or closing one eye\\nHolding objects close to face\\n\\nAny appearance of nearsighted symptoms warrants a comprehensive eye exam to assess the child’s status.\\nLong-Term Impacts of High Myopia\\nIn addition to blurred distance vision, high degrees of nearsightedness increase vulnerability for several blinding eye diseases later in adulthood. These include:\\n\\nRetinal detachment and tears\\nOpen-angle glaucoma\\nMyopic maculopathy\\n\\nAdvancing myopia also further elevates the risk of vision loss from these ocular conditions. Catching and controlling early myopia development can therefore help preserve long-term eye health and function.\\nBy understanding the hereditary factors at play and monitoring children’s eyes proactively, the impacts of myopia on visual and ocular health can be reduced over a lifetime.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nCompelling research confirms that nearsightedness (myopia) is influenced by genetic factors. And while they’re not the only factor, children with one or more myopic parents, especially at high degrees, need thorough eye exams starting at an early age to determine if they are developing refractive errors indicating myopia onset.\\nThrough early detection and consistent treatment, the progression of inherited myopia risks can be significantly slowed. While genetic predispositions cannot be changed, being proactive allows for preserving a child’s vision and safeguarding their eye health over time.\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child.

In fact, it is estimated that 20-25 million children have Myopia in the United States alone.\\xa0 With nearsightedness, objects up close are seen clearly while distant objects appear blurry or out of focus. This results when the eye grows too long from front to back measured by the axial length of the eye. The elongation of the eyeball causes light rays to focus incorrectly on the retina resulting in blurry distance vision. While nearsightedness cannot be cured, there are various options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia (nearsightedness).\\n\\nWhat Causes Nearsightedness? \\nNearsightedness occurs when the eyeball grows longer than normal from front to back. This causes the light entering the eye to focus in front of the retina rather than directly on it. This results in blurred distance vision, while near vision remains unaffected. Several factors contribute to the risk of developing nearsightedness, such as:\\n\\nGenetics – Research shows nearsightedness has a hereditary component. Children are more likely to be nearsighted if one or both parents have the condition vs. none.\\nFrequent near work – Activities requiring prolonged close vision like reading and screen use may encourage eyesight to adapt towards nearsightedness over time.\\nExcessive screen time – Increased use of computers, smartphones, tablets, and other screens is linked to rising myopia rates, especially in childhood.\\nReduced Outdoor time – Some studies indicate lack of outdoor exposure, natural sunlight, and vitamin D are associated with a greater incidence of nearsightedness.\\nUrbanization – Populations living in urban versus rural areas tend to have higher rates of myopia on average.\\nEthnicity – Individuals of Asian descent have a higher prevalence of nearsightedness. Many Asian countries see nearsightedness (myopia) rates of over 80%.\\n\\nSigns and Symptoms\\nThe primary symptom of nearsightedness is blurred distance vision. When looking at distant objects like road signs, movies, whiteboards, or presentations, it can be difficult to see when nearsighted. This forces the eyes to strain and overwork to bring images into focus. As a result, individuals with uncorrected nearsightedness may experience:\\n\\nDifficulty seeing school classroom boards\\nSquinting or leaning forward to see distant details such as the score of a game\\nHeadaches from excessive eye effort\\nEye fatigue after close work\\nPoor night vision or problems driving at night\\n\\nTypically, both eyes are affected, though not always to the same degree. The blurry distance vision worsens gradually over time in most cases.\\nImpacts of Uncorrected Nearsightedness\\nAllowing nearsightedness (myopia) to remain untreated can lead to several problems for your child. Myopia usually progresses over time, resulting in greater blur and dependence on treatment or correction as you age. Constant squinting and eye effort add to fatigue and discomfort, and unclear vision makes reading and seeing whiteboards at school difficult.\\nThere is also evidence that myopia can have social implications, such as extracurricular activities that require distance vision become challenging. Not to mention many career options that have vision requirements. However, all these issues don’t compare to the increased risk of severe eye conditions like Glaucoma, cataracts, and the potential for retinal detachments. The severity of nearsightedness (myopia) typically stabilizes by adulthood. However, getting your child’s vision treated early provides significant benefits for eye health, visual development, and quality of life.\\nTreatment Options for Nearsightedness\\nWhile nearsightedness itself cannot be reversed or cured, there are effective treatment options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. The best option will depend on the severity of nearsightedness, lifestyle needs, age, and overall eye health of your child – all of which are taken into account when getting treatment with a Treehouse Eyes provider.\\n\\nOvernight Contact Lenses – Specially designed contact lenses are designed to be worn at night only, put in right before bed, and taken out in the morning. Called KIDS lenses, these custom contact lenses gently and comfortably reshape the front surface of the eye during the night, with an effect that lasts all day. These lenses are customized for each child to fit their eye and are designed to help reduce the progression of myopia.\\nDaytime Soft Contact Lenses – These customized contact lenses are designed to be placed on the eye in the morning and removed each night. They have a special optical design to reduce the progression of myopia while providing clear vision during the day. This treatment allows children to be free from glasses all day while providing excellent comfort and vision for all their activities.\\nPrescription Eye Drops – Another treatment alternative is a prescription eye drop, formulated to a specific concentration known to reduce the progression of myopia. These drops are applied at night before bed, according to the schedule your Treehouse Eyes doctor recommends. The child wears glasses or contact lenses during the day.\\xa0 This treatment is excellent for families concerned if their child is ready for a contact lens treatment, and often used for younger children or those showing rapid progression.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nKeeping Nearsightedness (Myopia) Under Control\\nBelow are some helpful tips you can start using right now to help slow the progression of your child’s nearsightedness.\\n\\nReduce near work and screen time for children and take frequent visual breaks\\nIncrease time outdoors and exposure to natural sunlight\\nEnsure proper use and wear of prescribed vision correction\\nEat a diet rich in eye-healthy nutrients like vitamins C and E\\nGet yearly comprehensive eye exams to establish a baseline and monitor for changes\\n\\nThe Importance of Eye Exams\\nNearsightedness develops gradually over time but can accelerate quickly if not monitored. Routine eye exams allow early detection and treatment. Annual comprehensive exams are recommended for:\\n\\nChildren and teens showing signs of vision issues\\nIndividuals with a family history of high myopia\\nThose with existing myopia require close monitoring\\n\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\n\\xa0\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child.

Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long.\\n\\nBecause the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia.\\nThe hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night.\\nWhat Causes Myopia?\\nSeveral factors lead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status.\\nExcessive ‘Near Work’\\nMore than ever before, kids all over the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day, whether reading a book, or using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or another device.\\nNumerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially in excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and progression of myopia.\\nSome findings suggest that the intensity and duration of near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating novel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a magazine a few minutes at a time.\\nGenetics\\nA child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or your spouse are myopic.\\nNot Enough Outdoor Time\\nSpending at least 2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia!\\nWhat Can You Do?\\nThe good news is there are many things you can do you help slow or stop the progression of myopia.\\nGet Regular (annual or semi-annual) Eye Exams\\nEven if both parents aren’t myopic, it’s still recommended to get an annual eye exam for your child. You can schedule a myopia consultation with a Treehouse Eyes provider near you. Many pediatricians are able to complete basic eye exams – be sure to ask them to check for myopia!\\nEncourage Breaks from Excessive ‘Near Work’\\nMore than ever before, kids are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day. Encouraging breaks from near work such as reading and electronic devices will help your child’s eyes and give them a chance to get back outside as it warms up.\\nSpend More Time in Natural Sunlight\\nAs you encourage your child to take a break from near work, one of the best ways to enjoy that newfound time is to get outside! Natural sunlight, even in the classroom, can be protective of myopia. Be sure to wear some sunblock as well!\\nIf Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help!\\nWhat many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood.\\nThe good news is that myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease. You can prevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling your child’s myopia consultation with us today. Book your appointment by calling us at (626) 921-0199 or filling\\xa0this\\xa0out.

Both organizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life.\\nWhat is Myopia?\\nMyopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, resulting in blurry distance vision and increased risks of serious, sight-threatening eye diseases, such as glaucoma1, cataract2, or retinal eye diseases3. An estimated 1 in 3 children in the U.S. have myopia and the prevalence has grown dramatically over the last 30 years4. Research has shown lack of outdoor time for kids and more near work, like reading and time on screens, drive the massive increase we are seeing in myopia5-7.\\nMyopia Progresses As Your Child Grows\\nMyopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school-age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens.\\nBecause the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age.\\nNatural Sunlight Can Help\\nMyopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050.\\nIn fact, a recent study found that increased exposure to outdoor light reduces myopia development.\\nThere Are Now Treatments for Myopia\\nThere is hope for parents is there are several treatments now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good candidate for treatment.\\nYou can prevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling your child’s myopia consultation with us today.

This causes distant objects to appear blurry and increases the risk of serious, sight-threatening eye diseases in adulthood.\\nAs a parent, you want what’s best for your child. By learning these 5 important facts, you may feel encouraged to do more for your child’s eye health and long-term vision—such as ensuring that they get their eyes checked on a regular basis and turning to myopia management to prevent the rapid progression of this disease.\\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Has Increased Myopia Prevalence In Children\\nThe significant reduction in outdoor time during the pandemic combined with the surge in screen time has increased the incidence of myopia cases. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in Ophthalmic Research (2020), outdoor time helps slow down the change of axial length and reduce the risk of myopia.\\nSimilar results were found in a previous study in Ophthalmology (2013) that investigated the association between myopia in children and adolescents, and the amount of time spent outdoors. The study analyzed over 10,000 children and adolescents aged 20 and under and concluded a substantial correlation between increased time spent outside and the prevalence of myopia. Each additional hour spent outside per week was linked to a 2% reduction in the risk of myopia.\\nMyopia Increases the Risk of Eye Disease\\nThose with high myopia and rapidly progressing myopia in childhood are more prone to developing ocular comorbidities or serious sight-threatening eye diseases later in life, such as:\\nGlaucomaMacular degenerationMyopic MaculopathyRetinal detachment\\nMyopia is a Progressive Eye Disease\\nMyopia usually starts in childhood and progresses throughout a child’s school years, eventually stabilizing around ages 18-22.\\nSince the eye grows in sync with the rest of the body, it’s only natural that it ceases elongating in early adulthood when the rest of the body stops growing. This also means that a child’s growth spurts often coincide with a higher prescription.\\nFortunately, myopia can be efficiently treated in order to prevent it from worsening as the child grows. Slowing myopia early in life can make a significant difference in your child’s eye health in their present and future.\\nMyopia Is An Epidemic\\nMyopia is a global epidemic that continues to worsen, affecting close to 2 billion individuals worldwide.\\nIf current trends hold, roughly half of the world’s population will be myopic by the year 2050, partly due to genetics and increasingly as a result of our society’s preference for staying indoors and spending more time on digital screens.\\nMyopia Can Be Treated\\nMyopia cannot be cured; however, its progression can be slowed or even halted.\\nThe goal of myopia treatment, also known as myopia management or myopia control, is to reduce or halt the eye’s rapid growth. Effective myopia treatment entails more than simply correcting a child’s blurry vision with glasses; it’s meant to prevent a child’s vision from deteriorating and, thus lowering their risk of developing severe myopia-related eye diseases later in life.\\nGive your child the tools they need to succeed!

It alters the shape and structure of the eye limiting its capability to focus on objects in the distance (blurry distance vision). If you have struggled with the condition before, your kids might also develop the disorder at some point in life.\\n\\nMyopia starts with signs small signs such as squinting, sitting too close to the TV, tablet, or book, and sometimes even manifests as headaches. Besides pain and discomfort, the onset of myopia can have a ruinous impact on the quality of your kid’s life. It can be hard to read the board at school or perform well in extracurricular activities. Therefore, it is imperative to diagnose and prevent myopia from worsening to more sight-threatening conditions. We have hand-picked practical ways you can utilize in curbing the progression of myopia in children.\\nLet Them Spend Time Outdoors\\nThe bright and ambient light outdoors is linked to the modulation of correct eye development. Spending time outdoors can help reprogram the eye structure to focus on distant objects. You should encourage your kid to spend more time outdoors especially if he or she has already been diagnosed with myopia.\\nQuality outdoor time helps to preserve good eyesight in addition to delaying the onset or progression of nearsightedness. Ideally, children need a minimum of 90+ minutes of quality time outdoors every day.\\nRegular Eye Checks are Crucial\\nMyopia is a very treatable condition, particularly when detected early. That is why it is crucial to take your kid for an eye test at least once a year. The disorder might show very few signs in its early stages, which is why establishing baseline measurements early is paramount. Additionally, some of its signs like headache and blurry vision can easily be confused for other conditions.\\nWhen left untreated, myopia will gradually progress increasing the likelihood of contracting other vision disorders like cataracts or detached retinas. The only reliable manner to know if your kid is at risk of nearsightedness is through a clinical eye test measuring the axial length of the eye. If your eye doctor is not conducting this test, they are not providing you with the best measure of your child’s eye health.\\nLimit Screen Time\\nExcessive screen time and continuous near work are the greatest non-genetic risk factors for nearsightedness. Activities such as computer use, drawing, and reading can cause a substantial amount of strain on the eye. If your children cannot avoid these activities entirely, it is advisable to limit the time they spend on them.\\nTaking regular breaks helps the eye to relax and is ideal for managing the nearsightedness condition.\\nTry Soft-multifocal Lenses for Myopia Control\\nWe are still a few months or even years away from an FDA-approved eyeglass for treating myopia. By wearing our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses, your child no longer has to depend on glasses to have clear vision during the daytime. We understand that at times, glasses can be an inconvenience for activities like sports and other vigorous activities. As such, our contact lenses not only allow your child to see clearly but also be free from the hassle of wearing glasses. In addition, our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses, like all our other products, are FDA-approved, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Our doctors would also follow up in subsequent consultations to ensure that your child is doing well and that our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses are comfortable for their eyes.\\nGo for Atropine Eye Drops\\nAtropine eye drops can help keep the progression of nearsightedness in check by curbing eyeball elongation. The chemical agent also strengthens eyeball structures to prevent unwarranted eye growth that might occur in adolescent years to trigger myopia.\\nAtropine eye drops are safe when used in proper amounts. You should always follow the eye doctor’s prescription when administering the chemical for effective myopia modulation.\\nOvernight Lenses Might Help\\nTreehouse Eyes’ Overnight Contact Lenses are specially designed to be worn only in the evening as your child goes to bed. As such, our Overnight Contact Lenses should be worn during sleep and taken out in the morning before your child prepares for the day. Specifically called KIDS Lenses, these lenses are custom-made for each child to gently and comfortably reshape the cornea, which is the clear front surface of the eye. It’s incredibly important to ensure that our Overnight Contact Lenses are tailored to each child as everyone’s eye shape is different. If the lenses do not fit a particular eye shape, the eyes may get infected by a corneal abrasion. As such, at Treehouse Eyes, each child will undergo a consultation to receive his or her very own lenses that are fitted to their unique eye shape. Studies have shown that myopia progression can be slowed dramatically and, in some cases, stopped through this treatment in children.\\nConclusion\\nAlthough it is impossible to cure myopia, the condition can be treated with several clinical methods including the use of daytime soft lenses. A nearsightedness (or short-sightedness) diagnosis does not mean it is over for your child. Instead, you should focus on managing the conditions with the right practices to contain its progression and slow or potentially stop the disease in its tracks.\\n\\nFiled Under: eye health, Information Primary SidebarLatest Post Do Children And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses vs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your Performance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024Can Myopia Worsen Despite Corrected Visual HabitsApril 1, 2024Contact Lenses and Eye Exams: What You Need to KnowMarch 27, 2024\\n\\n\\nCategory AMD Awareness Monthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision changes\\n\\n\\nArchives  \\n\\n May 2024\\xa0(1)\\nApril 2024\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2024\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2024\\xa0(5)\\nJanuary 2024\\xa0(2)\\nDecember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nNovember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2023\\xa0(5)\\nSeptember 2023\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2023\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2023\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2023\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2023\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2022\\xa0(1)\\nNovember 2022\\xa0(2)\\nOctober 2022\\xa0(4)\\nSeptember 2022\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2022\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2022\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2022\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2022\\xa0(3)\\nFebruary 2022\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2022\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2021\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0(3)\\nAugust 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJuly 2021\\xa0(3)\\nJune 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2021\\xa0(3)\\nApril 2021\\xa0(3)\\nMarch 2021\\xa0(2)\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0(2)\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0(3)\\nDecember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nNovember 2020\\xa0(3)\\nOctober 2020\\xa0(3)\\nSeptember 2020\\xa0(2)\\nAugust 2020\\xa0(4)\\nJuly 2020\\xa0(2)\\nJune 2020\\xa0(3)\\nMay 2020\\xa0(2)\\nApril 2020\\xa0(4)\\nMarch 2020\\xa0(2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

Unfortunately, many people are unknowingly adopting habits that could be hurting their eyes. That’s why it’s a good idea to examine your everyday routine and daily habits to ensure you aren’t inadvertently doing something that could hurt your eyes.\\n\\nIn this article, your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen Optometric highlights some common habits that are bad for your eyes.\\nBad Habit #1: Not giving your eyes a break.\\nSmart phones, laptops, tablets,and other digital devices with LCD screens are a staple of almost everyone’s daily lives. While looking at digital screens cannot always be avoided, spare yourself from digital eye strain by resting your eyes after every 20 minutes of screen time.\\nBad Habit #2: Using contact lenses improperly.\\nIf you’ve undergone any type of lenses treatment such as neurolens therapy and need to wear special lenses, it’s critical that you follow your eye doctor’s instructions when it comes to handling and caring for your lenses. The same goes for standard contact lenses.\\nBad Habit #3: Rubbing your eyes.\\nThis habit might be a little harder to kick. It might feel gratifying to rub your eyes, but rubbing your eyes too vigorously can cause the blood vessels under your eyelids to break. Try a cold compress the next time your eyes feel irritated.\\nBad Habit #4: Not eating well.\\nA well-balanced diet is crucial to keeping your eyes healthy. Choose foods rich in vitamins C and E, as well as foods containing zinc and omega-3 fatty acids. You don’t have to cook elaborate meals — just make sure you load up on citrus fruits, fish and leafy greens.\\nLumen Optometric cares about your eye health.

The degree of myopia varies and it happens to around 30% of children and teens. To remedy this, there are specific treatments called myopia control. But what exactly is myopia control? As your locally trusted scleral optometrist,\\xa0we’re here to help you understand what you need to know about myopia control.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Myopia Control?\\n“Myopia control” is the term to describe the methods used to prevent the progression of myopia. These measures are usually prescribed by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. They come in four primary treatments, namely: multifocal contact lenses, atropine eye drops, multifocal eyeglasses, and orthokeratology. These treatments are important because they can help reduce the risk of complications that lead to high myopia, such as cataracts, retinal detachment, glaucoma and even blindness.\\nMultifocal Contact Lenses\\nThese lenses are designed to provide clear vision for people who have nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and other refractive errors. These are also designed for people who are experiencing the normal age-related loss of near focusing ability called presbyopia.\\nAtropine Eye Drops\\nThis is a kind of\\xa0dry eye treatment\\xa0that’s commonly used to reduce the pain associated with eye inflammation. It also gives relief from focusing fatigue by dilating the pupil to limit the eye’s ability to automatically change focus. Also called accommodation, the effect it has by atropine eye drops can be counted for its effectiveness in reducing myopia progression in children.\\nMultifocal Eyeglasses\\nThe eyeglasses work similarly to multifocal contact lenses, which help wearers with presbyopia see clearly. This control treatment can also mildly slow the progression of myopia in children. But some studies show that the progression slowed up to 51 percent in children compared to wearing normal glasses for correction.\\nOrthokeratology\\nOrthokeratology, or Ortho-K, are specially designed gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight while sleeping to help reshape the eye’s cornea. This slows down the progression of myopia as well as provides clearer vision during the daytime without the need for lenses or glasses. Some studies found that children wearing ortho-k contact lenses reduced the lengthening of the eyeball by almost 43 percent compared to wearing regular eyeglasses for myopia correction.\\nWhether you need myopia control or\\xa0neurolens treatment,\\xa0trust our team at Lumen Optometric to help you deal with your eye issues.

If your child doesn’t yet have myopia, following the same protocol will help prevent myopia onset for as long as possible.\\nIs it Possible To Prevent Myopia or Myopia Progression?\\nWhile many children inherit myopia from their parents, there are also several environmental factors that can lead to the onset and progression of nearsightedness. By making some lifestyle changes, it may be possible to delay the onset of myopia and prevent its progression.\\nBoost Daily Outdoor Time\\nResearch shows that children of myopic parents who spend a lot of time outdoors have lower rates of myopia than children who stay mostly indoors.\\nA recent study published in Review of Optometry (2021) concluded that children should spend at least 2-3 hours per day engaged in outdoor activities to delay the onset of myopia, especially if a child has one myopic parent.\\nAnother study published in Ophthalmic Research (2020) confirms the protective effect of “sun time” against myopia onset. When observing the myopia rates of 6-12-year-olds, there were fewer new myopia cases in the group of children who spent between 11-15 hours outdoors per week, compared with children who didn’t. The researchers also found that the myopia progression rate was slower in the group of children who spent more time in the daylight.\\nIf you do add some extra outdoor time to your child’s daily routine, be sure to provide them with UV blocking sunglasses, sunscreen, a water bottle and other sun-safe gear.\\nLimit Screen Time\\nScreen time is thought to have a greater impact on a child’s vision than other near work like reading a book, for a few reasons.\\nChildren are exposed to digital screens at a younger age than other forms of near work, and they tend to use screens for longer intervals of time. Additionally, the working distance between a child’s eyes and a digital screen tends to be shorter than the distance between their eyes and a book or other object, to compensate for the small print size and images.\\nAn article published in Review of Myopia Management (2021) examines the results of several scientific studies that analyze the relationship between screen time and myopia. Two of these studies found that the risk of developing myopia was 8 times greater for children aged 5-15 who used a smartphone or video game for more than 2 hours a day, compared to children who have 0-2 hours of daily screen time.\\nAnd while we don’t expect parents to ban all digital devices from their homes, it is advisable to set daily limits on digital device usage.\\nTry to cap your child’s daily screen time at 2 hours. Children under the age of 2 should have as little screen time as possible.\\nEncourage Frequent Breaks From Near Work\\nAny sort of near work, like reading and writing, puts a strain on your child’s eyes and can contribute to myopia onset and progression.\\nOne way to prevent myopia development in your child is to teach them to take breaks from visually demanding activities.\\nA 2008 study published in the journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science found that the intensity of near work plays an important role in myopia development in schoolchildren. According to the study, the duration of uninterrupted near work seems to be more significant than the overall time spent engaged in close-distance activities.\\nRegular Myopia Eye Exams\\nWhether or not your young child or teen has myopia, yearly eye exams with your optometrist are crucial to keeping their vision healthy and clear.\\nIt’s important to note that vision screenings in school are not enough to detect most visual problems, and certainly not for preventing myopia.\\nTracking your child’s eyesight yearly will help determine the best treatment for preventing myopia onset and slowing or halting its progression.\\nTreehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression\\nThe good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids—just like yours—so they can have their best shot at academic and social success!\\nThe Treehouse Eyes eye doctors use state-of-the-art equipment to develop a personalized treatment plan for your child.

While instances and awareness of myopia are on the rise, to help spread myopia awareness we’ve written out the basics on childhood myopia, why it matters, and what you as a parent can do to help preserve your child’s eye health in the long run.\\n\\n\\nWhat is Myopia?\\nMyopia (often referred to as nearsightedness) is the most common cause of impaired vision in people under age 40, and its prevalence in children is growing at an alarming rate.\\nMyopia typically starts in childhood and progresses (the eye keeps getting bigger), or gets worse, until early adulthood. During this time the symptom of myopia, blurry distance vision, gets worse, meaning the patient needs stronger glasses to continue to see clearly. If blurry distance vision is the symptom of myopia, what exactly is myopia? Stated again, myopia is an eye that is growing too long. How do we know this?\\nWe measure it using special non-invasive technology to calculate the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length and is measured down to fractions of a millimeter with advanced equipment. So, myopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye.\\nRisk Factors for Myopia\\nMyopia risk factors include genetics (having one or both parents myopic), an insufficient amount of time spent outdoors, and excessive near work (time spent reading, school work, & digital screens).\\nChildhood myopia is progressive, which is why your child may need a new prescription every year or two. Unless treated, a child’s myopia will continue to worsen until early adulthood. What some people don’t realize is that myopia is far more than simply blurred vision — it’s associated with drastically higher risk of developing eye disease in the future.\\nHow Can Myopia Impact a Child’s Health?\\nChildhood myopia places a child at a greater risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life, as compared to non-myopic children, and the odds only increase as myopia continues to progress.\\nIn fact, a child with myopia is 2 to 40 times more likely to develop myopic maculopathy (also known as myopic macular degeneration, a serious vision-threatening complication) depending on their degree of nearsightedness.\\nRetinal detachment is another serious eye condition that can cause permanent blindness. A myopic child is 3 to 21 times more likely to develop this emergency eye condition in adulthood.\\nMoreover, children with myopia have a threefold risk of developing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, in the long run.\\nAnd although cataracts are considered a normal part of aging, having myopia advances the age at which they develop. According to a study published in JAMA Ophthalmology, individuals with high myopia are more likely to need cataract surgery at an earlier age than those with no myopia.\\nFurthermore, aside from an increased risk of adult eye disease, untreated myopia can prevent a child from succeeding academically and socially.\\nA 2019 study published in the Community Eye Health Journal underscores the importance of excellent visual acuity in school-aged children. It found that offering vision correction to students with myopia has more of an educational impact than providing them with vitamins or medications to maintain or improve their physical health.\\nMyopia has equally serious ramifications outside the classroom. A study published in BMC Ophthalmology (2016) found that adolescents with myopia are more likely to have anxiety than their peers with normal vision.\\nFurthermore, adverse visual symptoms impact a child’s self-esteem, according to a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science.\\nThe good news is that certain lifestyle choices, especially when coupled with myopia management treatment, can have a lasting positive effect on your child’s eye health.\\nWhat Can Parents Do To Help Slow Myopia Progression?\\nWe know that parents want what’s best for their children. So here are a few recommendations that will help keep your child’s eyes healthy — whether or not myopia has set in.\\nTake your kids outside to play. Several studies have indicated that children who spend over 2 hours outdoors during the day have lower levels of myopia and slower myopia progression.\\nA recent study published in BMC Ophthalmology and cited in Review of Optometry (2021) found that for non-myopic children with myopic parents, “a high level of outdoor exposure had a remarkable influence on the risk of new myopia for children even with one myopic parent.”\\nAlthough it’s not always easy, try to limit the amount of continuous near work your child does. Whether it’s reading or scrolling through a phone, remind your child to take breaks.\\nHowever, the most important thing you can do to protect your child’s long-term eye health is manage their myopia with treatment.\\nWe Can Help Preserve Your Child’s Eye Health\\nAt Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to provide expert care to each and every child with kindness and a smile.\\nOur state-of-the-art equipment and diagnostic technology enable us to thoroughly assess your child’s visual condition and needs. We offer the latest treatments to manage your child’s myopia and effectively slow down how quickly myopia progresses.\\nHelp your child succeed in school and in activities, and offer them a better overall quality of life with myopia management.\\nGive your child the tools they need to succeed!

Clear sight is vital for kids to thrive in school, sports, play, and daily life. However, many children have undiagnosed vision issues that require early detection and intervention for the best outcomes.\\n\\nWhy Early Detection Matters\\nCatching vision problems early in childhood is crucial. Early detection ensures children get the vision correction they need during critical developmental windows. Those children suffering from vision deficits can lead to academic issues, behavioral problems, and even low self-esteem issues.\\nSigns Your Child May Need an Eye Exam\\nThere are several signs parents should look for that may indicate a child is struggling with their vision:\\n\\nFrequent squinting or rubbing of the eyes\\nSitting very close to the TV or holding devices close to the face\\nTilting the head to one side\\nCovering one eye\\nDifficulty seeing the board at school\\nAvoiding reading/close work\\nLosing place while reading\\nTrouble differentiating colors\\nClumsiness or poor hand-eye coordination\\nHeadaches or eye pain after visual tasks\\n\\nIf you observe any of these symptoms, schedule an eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist who specializes in pediatric patients. An exam can identify issues like nearsightedness, farsightedness, lazy eye, convergence problems, and other disorders.\\nProtecting Your Child’s Vision Health\\nAlong with regular eye exams, there are several ways parents can help maintain healthy eyesight:\\n\\nEnsure your child wears 100% UV-blocking sunglasses outside\\nLimit screen time and take frequent breaks from ‘near-work’\\nProvide a nutritious diet with eye-healthy vitamins\\nAvoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure\\n\\nFollowing your eye doctor’s specialized treatment plan is also essential to managing any vision conditions your child is diagnosed with.\\nThe Benefits of Annual Eye Exams\\nGetting your child’s eyes checked every year is a critical piece of preventive healthcare. At annual exams, optometrists and ophthalmologists thoroughly evaluate vision acuity, eye alignment, and eye health. Treehouse Eyes optometrists go a step further by measuring axial length to determine if myopia is present or not. This allows early detection of refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness) as well as other eye disorders like amblyopia or strabismus, which require prompt treatment.\\nCatching and addressing issues early improves outcomes and treats the issues rather than just correcting them with glasses. Annual exams also screen for eye diseases and conditions that rarely show apparent symptoms in kids, like glaucoma. Preventing and controlling these disorders protects long-term vision.\\nTreehouse Eyes is proud to join in Children’s Eye Health and Safety Month by helping educate families about protecting one of their child’s most precious gifts—the ability to see the world clearly. By scheduling comprehensive eye exams each year and remaining vigilant for signs of vision issues, parents can ensure their child’s visual development stays on track. If you have any concerns about your child’s vision, consult a Treehouse Eyes doctor near you. Healthy eyes and clear sight in childhood provide a lifetime of benefits.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child. Our treatment plans include special prescription eye drops and customized daytime and overnight contact lenses. Treehouse Eyes doctors determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at your initial consultation.

One key factor that significantly impacts eye development is myopia, also known as nearsightedness.\\nMyopia occurs when the eyeball elongates (grows too long) from front to back, causing light rays to focus incorrectly and distant objects to appear blurry. This eye growth is driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\\nResearch shows myopia is becoming more prevalent globally, affecting around 30% of the world’s population, with an estimated 50% by the year 2050. Theories for this increase include frequent near-work on digital devices/homework and less time outdoors early in life. Both can strain the visual system and put the eyes at risk for abnormal elongation.\\nWhen myopia develops, the implications go beyond the need for vision correction. Excessive eye growth is linked to a higher risk of blinding conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment later in life. Myopia also reduces the quality of life, at school, when playing sports, participating in extracurriculars, and activities requiring distance vision like driving.\\nSo what proactive steps can be taken to support healthy eye development and reduce the odds of myopia onset?\\nThe most important step you can take is to get your child a yearly eye exam. This ensures that their vision is being monitored and tracked in case of issues like myopia. Below are a few other tips to help support your child’s eye health.\\n\\nIncrease time outdoors, especially in early childhood.\\nAvoid chronic use of screens/mobile devices at young ages\\nMaintain clear focus on distant objects through activities like sports\\nGet regular eye exams to monitor for signs of abnormal growth\\nEat a nutritious diet and nutrients that may support ocular health\\nUnderstand your genetic predispositions and family history\\n\\nThe key is taking preventive actions early. Though myopia itself cannot be reversed once manifested, slowing or even stopping the progression is possible. Implementing healthy lifestyle habits and frequent eye assessments allows for early intervention against excessive eye growth in children.\\nSo… do your eyes grow?\\nYes. Just like all other parts of the body, your eyes grow as well. Where issues occur is when the eyeball grows too long from front to back (a.k.a. Myopia), resulting in blurred distance vision.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child.

Myopia Symptoms and How To Treat / Blog /  Information / Does My Child Have Myopia? Myopia Symptoms and How To TreatDoes My Child Have Myopia? Myopia Symptoms and How To Treat\\nDecember 2, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Treehouse Eyes is a specialty pediatric eye care practice treating myopic children with a nationwide network of doctors. Recently, doctors in our Treehouse Eyes community had the chance to spread the word about myopia with local media coverage. Our doctors are passionate about spreading awareness about the myopia epidemic and how early intervention can mean a lot for your child’s eye health. Explore some of the topics our peers covered in recent interviews.\\n\\nHow To Tell If Your Child Is Nearsighted\\nIt’s not always simple to detect whether or not your child is nearsighted. Watching out for the common symptoms of myopia is key to determine whether or not your child needs treatment. Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Aimee Jacobs OD, discusses some signs to look out for.\\nDr. Jacobs explains, “If they’re having trouble focusing in school, if they can’t stay on task, if it seems like it might be a behavior issue, a lot of times it’s because they can’t see what they’re doing or they can’t see what they’re doing well enough to focus on it.”\\nScreen Time As a Risk Factor\\nAs screen time increases, so does the early onset of myopia. Treehouse Eyes has observed a 30 percent increase in the number of myopic children being treated since the pandemic began. Dr. Tiffany Martinez recalls the effects of the pandemic on children, “During the pandemic we saw a lot more kids they we saw become myopic than we did before.” This is due to the decreased time outdoors and increase in near work.\\nAnother Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Ryan Stybel describes the effects of too much ‘near work’, “Screen time or near work is causing myopia to start at an earlier age but also progress more rapidly.”\\nHe then goes on to explain the implications of COVID isolation, “We’re just getting through a pandemic, myopia is an epidemic especially with the increased screen time and virtual learning. Limiting screen time is a very important thing and taking frequent breaks and spending time outdoors. We recommend 90 minutes a day outdoors to use the natural sunlight and looking at distance objects can be beneficial and help their eyes from getting worse.”\\nWhat To Look For As a Parent:\\nMyopia is a treatable and preventable disease, annual eye exams are highly recommended because often times children are unable to articulate their symptoms to a parent.\\nDr. Denise Smith, a Treehouse Eyes doctor featured on KVUE-TV in Austin, Texas provides some tips on how to detect myopia, “Parents can be looking for if the child is squinting, if they can’t see the board at school they might be complaining of headaches, or holding books closer to their face holding their phone closer, maybe getting closer to the television.”\\nSo why is it essential to go through myopia management and treatment rather than just getting glasses? Dr. Smith explains why myopia treatment is critical, “If the child is diagnosed with myopia, just getting glasses can help them see clearly, but will not do anything to stop the progression or prevent the eyeball from getting longer. So you want to be able to have those specialized treatments to actually stop that process which in turn can prevent sight threatening disorders later on.”\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia\\nTreating myopia early is crucial to prevent children’s vision from getting worse. Our mission is to give children better vision for life so children can have a life advantage to being able to participate in more activities. Myopia management also provides a lower risk for future vision related disease such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataracts.

It occurs when the eye is unable to focus on distant objects without corrective lenses like glasses or contacts. Myopia is caused by a variety of factors, including genetic and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age.\\n\\nIs Myopia Genetic?\\nIf you’re thinking about myopia, knowing if it’s genetic is essential. If you happen to be myopic, then your kids might be at risk of developing the same condition.\\nMyopia has two types: genetic and non-genetic (or “acquired”). Genetic myopia is passed down through families and tends to run in certain clusters or patterns. Non-genetic means that individuals develop their vision issues without any family history or a genetic predisposition toward poor vision.\\nIn general, suppose both parents have healthy eyesight but have children with poor vision (without any other eye problems). It’s likely that those kids were born with a form of genetic myopia known as Axial Myopia (AM). About half of all cases fall into this category!\\nWhy Does Myopia Get Worse with Age?\\nWhen you find out your child is first diagnosed with myopia, it is essential to intervene as early as possible. Myopia progresses when a child’s eye grows too long from front to back, causing permanent and irreversible eye growth, known as axial elongation (the measure of the eye from front to back).\\nWhen a Treehouse Eyes doctor finds a low level of myopia (nearsightedness), it’s easier to treat with a wider range of treatment options. In short, myopia changes as we age due to axial length elongation that occurs during childhood. The longer the eyeball gets, it’s associated with serious eye conditions that can lead to permanent vision loss such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts.\\nThis is why it is imperative to treat myopia as early as possible and start getting your child’s eye examined annually to catch any changes in their vision.\\nHow to Stop Myopia from Getting Worse with Age\\nTo prevent myopia from getting worse with age, it’s important to get your child regular eye exams and see the treatment options for myopia such as custom contact lenses or prescription eye drops. If you’re concerned about your eyesight, it’s always a good idea to schedule an appointment with a Treehouse Eyes optometrist.\\nConclusion\\nMyopia is a common vision problem that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by a variety of factors, including genetics and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. The key to properly treating myopia and preventing it from worsening is by catching it early, typically in childhood.\\nBy following the tips mentioned above, you can help prevent myopia from getting worse and maintain good eye health.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor.

There is some debate about whether myopia is a disease or a refractive error. The answer is uncovered by how myopia is defined and measured.\\n\\nWhat Is The Definition Of A Disease?\\nThe Review of Myopia Management provides a few definitions of disease to consider:\\n\\nA disease is any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional state of an organism, generally associated with certain signs and symptoms and differing in nature from physical injury. (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020)\\nA disease is an abnormal condition affecting a living organism. Diseases are generally understood to be medical conditions that involve a pathological process associated with a specific set of symptoms. (Infectious Disease News, 2019)\\n\\nMyopia, also called nearsightedness or shortsightness, is the inability to see objects at a distance and is the most common vision issue amongst children and adults. Myopia’s main symptom is blurry distance vision; however, the physiological implications of myopia is that the eyeball itself grows too long from front to back, see figure 1 below.\\n\\nIs Myopia Curable?\\nThe question of whether or not myopia is curable helps illustrate why myopia is a disease. Treehouse Eyes doctor, Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. addresses the common question, “Can myopia be cured?” Myopia is not curable, but it can be treated. “Unfortunately, once myopia happens, which happens due to the eyeball growing too long, it is impossible to shrink it afterwards. When myopia occurs, it is permanent and irreversible.”\\nDr. Mai then goes on to explain the importance of early intervention, “We can prevent high levels of myopia which are associated with diseases such as macular maculopathy and retinal detachment. Starting treatment early is critical because there is no cure for myopia and once a child is diagnosed with this disease, it typically gets worse if left untreated.”\\nMyopia is a disease that can be treated at the source by providing children with treatment options, rather than just giving a child glasses for the symptom of myopia which is blurry vision.\\nMyopia Is a Disease\\nAlthough myopia has symptoms like blurry vision, that aren’t caused by physical injury, myopia itself is caused by the eye growing too long. In other words, the axial length increases outside of the normal rate for a child’s age. See Figure 2 below.\\n\\n\\xa0Image Source\\nThe elongation of the eye is the core issue. Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. details, “The greater the myopia, the longer the axial length of the eye and thus greater risk. Myopia is clearly a disease. One that requires treatment to reduce the negative impact it can have on a person’s eye health and vision.”\\nMyopia is a significant, prevalent disease in children with increasing rates of progression. There are also two types of classifications: non-pathologic and pathologic myopia.\\nHow is Myopia Treated?\\nTreehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor.

The goal of this procedure is to reduce myopia or nearsightedness of patients. To know more about Ortho-K and what to expect, here is a list of frequently asked questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. “Are there age restrictions for Ortho-K?”\\nNone. Children as young as six years old have been treated with Ortho-K lenses. In fact, the treatment is one of the most common methods of vision correction in pre-teens and teens.\\n2. “Who is considered a good candidate?”\\nOrtho-K proves to be an effective treatment for farsighted, nearsighted and astigmatic patients. If your child has been unable to wear contact lenses, due to discomfort or allergies, they make a good candidate. This is because Ortho-K lenses are easy to use and can be worn while sleeping.\\n3. “How do Ortho-K lenses differ from typical lenses?”\\nOrtho-K contact lenses are specifically designed with highly oxygen-permeable material. The back surface of the lens is particularly made to enable the reshaping of the corneal tissue.\\n4. “How long does it take to reach good vision?”\\nStable vision can be achieved after 10-14 days of treatment, depending on the prescription. In fact, 50-70% of the desired visual correction is attained after the first night of wear.\\n5. “How long can Ortho-K provide myopia control?”\\nThe effect of myopia control should last as long as your use of Ortho-K lenses. It is advisable for young children to wear the lenses until their late teens when myopia tends to destabilize. Fortunately, there are no anecdotal reports from patients that state ‘rebounding’ after their use of ortho-K contact lenses has come to an end.\\nTo get started with Ortho-K treatment, it is essential to contact a trusted eye exam doctor. Here at Lumen Optometric, we strive to provide excellent full-service eye care solutions with outstanding patient care services to match.

This is especially true with the pandemic upheaving our lives and forcing us to stay home for virtual learning or work from home. The consequences are not just limited to heightened obesity rates. Studies have shown that having less sunlight could actually change the ways that a child’s eyes develop, resulting in a myopia epidemic that rises in tandem with the obesity crisis. You need to encourage your child to spend more time outdoors to protect their eyesight and prevent myopia.\\n\\nDownsides of Spending Time Indoors\\nAccording to a recent Australian study, kids who spend only about 20 minutes per day outdoors experience quicker growth in the length of their eyes than those who log more hours in bright eyes. This can result in myopia and trouble seeing faraway objects. Thankfully, there are some ways available that you can still use to keep an eye on your child’s eyesight. They are listed as follows.\\nNot Enough Outdoor Time\\nSpending at least 2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia!\\nEncourage Outdoor Time\\nOur eyes need an optimal amount of bright light that can be gotten from outdoors. Therefore, by aiming for around 40 minutes of outdoor time daily, not only can your children get the physical activity that they need that day, but it can also be beneficial to their eyes and help to prevent the onset of myopia.\\nLook out for Warning Signs\\nIt is important to look out for warning signs that your child might have myopia so that they can get treated for it early. Children suffering from myopia may squint, constantly feel the need to rub their eyes or complain of consistent headaches, they may also start having trouble with their academic grades. If your child experiences any of these symptoms, it is important to schedule an appointment with an optometrist.\\nSchedule Regular Screenings\\nTo help prevent or manage myopia, it is important to have regular eye screenings for your child. Doctors recommend yearly vision screenings either by your child’s pediatrician or their school as well as a vision screen at well-child visits through age 4. Newborn babies should also have their vision tested before they leave the hospital, and before your child hits the age of 5, it is important to take them to a pediatric ophthalmologist for a thorough checkup if they are suffering from any vision concerns or have a family history of vision concerns.\\nIf Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help!\\nWhat many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood.\\nThe good news is that myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease. You can prevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling your child’s myopia consultation with us today.

But how much do you really know about this progressive eye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll explore 4 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about your child’s eye health and long-term vision.\\n\\n\\n\\nMyopia is an Eye Disease\\nMyopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. As this happens, the symptoms of the disease are blurry distance vision.\\nBecause the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. To help combat this, we recommend eye exams every six months to track myopia progress.\\n\\nIt’s More Common Than You Think\\nMyopia is an eye disease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people worldwide. We are currently on pace to have half of the world’s population with some degree of myopia by the year 2050! Indoor time, excessive ‘near work’, and genetic factors all play a role in the growth of myopia.\\n\\nEducation For Their Future\\nMyopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school-age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens.\\nBecause the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development when they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age.\\n\\nMyopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease\\n\\nMyopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight-threatening eye diseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment later in life.\\nChildren with high myopia have a 50% higher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop cataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults than children who don’t have myopia.\\nMyopia is more than just a matter of clear vision — a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided their children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic maculopathy fell by 40%.\\n\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes offers customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor.

Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long.\\nBecause the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia.\\nIt can affect both children and adults, with over 50% of American teenagers being myopic according to this journal.\\nHere are some ways to recognize the signs and symptoms of myopia in children.\\n\\n\\nConsistent Headaches\\nHeadaches can be a common system of vision problems, it is important to track how often your child is experiencing symptoms of headaches. Some headaches may be a result of allergy symptoms or pressure changes, but they could also be a direct result of nearsightedness. If your child is experiencing more than one headache per week, do schedule an appointment with an optometrist or pediatrician to try and get your vision checked for myopia.\\nExcessive Eye-Watering\\nExcessive eye-watering can also be a symptom of myopia, given that it can result in discomfort in the eyes. If your child experiences consistent and excessive eye-watering, do schedule an appointment with an optometrist to get your vision checked.\\nExcessive Squinting\\nIf your child is squinting excessively, it might also be a symptom of myopia. This is due to the fact that humans suffering from myopia squint as a result in changes in the tension of their eye muscles, providing them with brief clarity of vision. Thereby, it should be easy to spot individual suffering from nearsightedness if he or she engages in excessive squinting.\\nHolding Objects Close to Their Face\\nAnother glaring symptom to look for if wondering is if your child constantly holds objects closer to their face to see them properly. This is a clear symptom of nearsightedness which may be caused by excessive usage of screen time.\\nConsistent Rubbing Of Eyes\\nWhen dealing with a young child that might potentially have myopia, they might often rub their eyes as a sign of discomfort. If you notice that your child excessively and consistently rubs their eyes, it might be a sign to schedule a consultation with the optometrist to have their vision assessed.\\nSitting Very Close to the TV\\nYou might find your child sitting too close to the TV than they normally do. The most apparent sign that your child may have myopia, especially for older kids, is if they grumble about the images on the TV screen looking unclear or blurry, or if they tell you they have issues reading the words shown on screens.\\nLet TreeHouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor.

This is unfortunate as your eye health and visual acuity have a major impact on your overall well being and quality of life. . In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric shares some simple eye health tips for young adults.\\n\\nTake a Break When Using Digital Devices\\nYoung adults tend to spend a lot of time on their digital devices. Unfortunately, staring at a computer or phone screen for too long can make the eyes feel dry and tired, eventually causing blurred vision. This is because people tend to blink less when staring at a digital screen. To avoid digital eye strain, you need to give your eyes frequent breaks. You can do this by following the 20-20-20 rule: after 20 minutes of screen time, look at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds to give your eyes a break.\\nPractice Good Contact Lens Hygiene\\nIf you wear contact lenses, it’s critical to observe proper hygiene to avoid eye infections. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses and keep water away from your contacts. Use fresh contact lens disinfecting solution every time. Always wash your hands with soap and water and then dry them with a clean cloth before touching your contact lenses. Most importantly, follow your eye doctor’s recommendations about replacing your contact lenses. Don’t wear a pair of contact lenses beyond their scheduled replacement date.\\nLead a Healthy Lifestyle\\nThe three most important things you can do to safeguard your vision are maintaining a healthy diet, exercising often and avoiding smoking. Leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and diabetic retinopathy. You should also practice good sleeping habits. Lack of sleep can adversely affect your health in many ways.\\nLumen Optometric offers a wide range of eye care services including orthokeratology therapy, neurolens therapy and more.

In our technologically driven world, conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism are becoming increasingly prevalent among children. This article will unpack these conditions, helping you understand what they are, how they differ, and most importantly, what you can do to manage and treat them.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Differences Between Myopia and Astigmatism\\nMyopia results when your eye grows too long from front to back, causing light to focus before it reaches the retina. If a normal eye is shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye may more closely resemble a football. In contrast, astigmatism is usually due to an irregularly shaped cornea or lens.\\nMyopia primarily affects distance vision, while astigmatism affects vision at all distances. Both conditions can coexist in one eye, and they often do. This combination can further complicate vision, making it crucial to address both issues.\\nCombining Science and a Child-Centric Approach\\nAt Treehouse Eyes®, we combine robust, science-backed data with inspiring aesthetics for both children and parents alike. We’ve created an environment that children love, helping to alleviate the fear sometimes associated with medical appointments.\\nOur team of experts provides thorough eye examinations using the latest technology, identifying refractive errors and other eye health issues early. We then create a personalized treatment plan that suits the needs and lifestyle of your child.\\nMyopia and astigmatism are common eye conditions that can affect children of all ages. If your child has been diagnosed with either of these conditions, it’s important to seek early treatment to protect their vision and prevent further complications.\\xa0\\nManaging Myopia and Astigmatism with Treehouse Eyes®\\nSo, how can you protect your child’s vision if they’re diagnosed with myopia or astigmatism? Treehouse Eyes® is the first and only dedicated myopia management service provider in the United States. Our myopia management treatment options help slow down the progression of myopia in children, reducing the risk of developing severe vision problems later in life.

If this is the case, you may feel relieved about this, but does it really mean you have perfect vision? To answer this, we’ll first explain the related vision terminology to help you understand how we measure your vision’s quality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisual Acuity\\nVisual acuity is the term used to express the clarity or sharpness of your vision. This is measured by your ability to identify the letters or numbers on a standardized eye chart while standing at a certain distance. So, for instance, if you have 20/20 vision, you can see clearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance. Similarly, if you have 20/100 vision, it must mean that you can see as close as 20 feet to see what those with 20/20 vision normally see at 100 feet.\\n20/20 vision doesn’t always mean your eyesight is perfect. For instance, if you’re getting nearsighted, we may recommend that you use our\\xa0orthokeratology\\xa0lenses to slow its progression. But then this only indicates how sharp and clear your vision is at a distance. There are also other vision skills that are just as important, such as eye coordination, side vision, focusing ability, color vision, and depth perception.\\nThe Snellen visual acuity system is named after the Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, who developed the system in 1862. The system uses acuity measurements in fractions of 20/20, 20/40, 20/60, and so on. The numerator or the top number of the Snellen fraction is the distance between the eye chart and the patient. In the U.S., the viewing distance is usually 20 feet while in other countries, it’s 6 meters.\\nMeanwhile, the bottom number of the fraction corresponds to the visual acuity of the patient. Higher numbers mean less clarity and sharpness in eyesight. For instance, the Big “E” that you see in most Snellen eye charts corresponds to 20/200 visual acuity. If this is the only letter you can discern, then there’s a chance that you may be legally blind unless prescribed with corrective\\xa0contact lenses.\\nThe Factors and Limits\\nThe major factors that determine visual acuity are as follows:\\n1. The accuracy of how the lens and cornea of the eye focuses light onto the retina\\n2. The sensitivity of the nerves in the retina and vision centers in the brain\\n3.

In the article, we’ll dive deep into these distinct vision impairments, understand their distinctive characteristics, and explore current treatment modalities.\\nUnderstanding Myopia and Hyperopia\\nMyopia, also referred to as nearsightedness, is a vision condition whose symptoms are blurry distance vision. This is a result of the eye growing too long from front to back leading to blurry vision when looking at faraway objects.\\nOn the other hand, hyperopia, or farsightedness, is the opposite. Distant objects are clear, but those up close appear blurry. This condition occurs when the eye is too short from front to back, or the cornea is too flat, leading to light focusing behind the retina.\\nDiagnosis and Differences\\nThe diagnosis of both conditions involves scheduling a routine eye exam – especially one trained to spot myopia like the doctors at Treehouse Eyes. These exams include visual acuity tests, refraction assessments, and eye health evaluations. Be sure that your eyecare provider is measuring your child’s axial length to ensure an accurate diagnosis of myopia. Axial length will measure how long the eye is front to back.\\nNotably, the critical difference between myopia and hyperopia lies in their distinct symptoms and the way they affect vision. People with myopia often have difficulty viewing road signs, and whiteboards, or watching a movie at a cinema or at home. In contrast, those with hyperopia may struggle with tasks like reading, using a smartphone, doing homework, and other times where closer vision is necessary.\\nTreatment Modalities\\nFortunately, both myopia and hyperopia are manageable with several treatment options. The key for both, but especially myopia, is early detection and treatment. Myopia is a disease that typically develops in children (ages 6 – 12) and continues through puberty until the child stops growing. This can sometimes be well into adulthood (25 years old in some cases) which is why early treatment and prevention are key to slowing or stopping the progression of myopia.\\nFor children, orthokeratology, or Ortho-K, is a potential treatment. It involves the use of specially designed gas-permeable contact lenses that temporarily reshape the cornea to help treat your childs myopia. Recent studies suggest that certain types of multifocal contact lenses may slow the progression of myopia in children. Furthermore, low-dose atropine eye drops have shown promising results in minimizing the advancement of myopia.\\nConclusion\\nUnderstanding the differences between myopia and hyperopia is vital in recognizing the need for a timely eye exam and appropriate treatment. Through modern optometry, children are now able to receive the treatment and care they need to improve their vision and quality of life.\\nRemember, regular eye examinations are critical to detect any visual impairments at an early stage. If your child is experiencing any changes in their vision, contact your local Treehouse Eyes doctor.\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child. Our treatment plans include special prescription eye drops and customized daytime and overnight contact lenses. Treehouse Eyes doctors determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at your initial consultation.

Still, it can also bring a host of changes to your vision. As the hormones in your body change and fluctuate during this period, you may experience various eye-related issues that can affect how clearly you see or make your eyes uncomfortable\\n\\nIt’s good to be aware of these common changes and take steps to protect your vision throughout pregnancy.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommon Vision Changes During Pregnancy\\xa0\\nHere’s what you can expect:\\n\\n\\nDry Eyes\\xa0– Many women experience dry eyes during pregnancy due to hormonal fluctuations. It usually happens around mid-pregnancy when hormone levels are at their highest point and decreases after delivery as hormone levels return to normal.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBlurry Vision\\xa0– During pregnancy, it is not uncommon for women’s eyesight to become blurry or cloudy due to their changing hormones. It should resolve itself once their hormone levels return to normal after childbirth.\\n\\n\\nLight Sensitivity\\xa0– Some pregnant women find themselves more sensitive than usual when exposed to bright lights, such as sunlight or fluorescent lighting in stores or office buildings, which can cause discomfort.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFloaters\\xa0– Small spots may appear in front of one’s field of vision, known as floaters. These tend to increase with age but may temporarily worsen during pregnancy because many people become dehydrated while expecting a baby.\\n\\n\\nGlaucoma\\xa0– Women with a family history of glaucoma are at higher risk for developing it during the later stages of their pregnancies, so regular checkups with an optometrist will help ensure that any potential problems are caught early on before causing further damage. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nEye Health During Pregnancy\\nHere are some tips for protecting vision during pregnancy:\\n\\n\\nEat plenty of fruits and vegetables high in vitamins A and C.\\n\\n\\nDrink plenty of fluids, like water, every day.\\n\\n\\nWear sunglasses outdoors if needed.\\n\\n\\nGet regular checkups from an optometrist throughout all trimesters.\\n\\n\\nRest often and get adequate sleep each night.\\n\\n\\nManage stress by taking breaks from work, exercising regularly, etc.\\n\\n\\nWhy You Should Get Checked\\nIf pregnant women fail to protect their vision, they risk serious complications such as premature birth, miscarriage and gestational diabetes. Regular optometrist visits are essential to catch any potential problems before they become more severe.\\nLumen Optometric in Sierra Madre, CA, is dedicated to providing comprehensive eye care for all stages of life.

If you’d like to improve your vision with high-quality contact lenses, our skilled eye care specialists can help.\\n\\nComplete Contact Lens Exams\\nLumen Optometric completes in-depth contact exams. Contact exams are similar to comprehensive eye exams, but they provide additional tests to make sure your eye health won’t be impacted by contact lens use. Using the latest technology and training, we can measure your eye surface and eye moisture levels to determine the correct size, type and prescription to best fit your health and lifestyle needs.\\nBenefits of Contact Lenses\\n\\nClarity. Like glasses, contact lenses improve vision by using light and refraction. But while eyeglasses can obstruct your peripheral vision, contact lenses conform to your eyes to offer a wider field of view.\\nEase. Contact lenses don’t get in the way of an active lifestyle. Patients who exercise, play sports or like to be outside often feel less encumbered when wearing contact lenses.\\nVersatility. Some patients prefer the way they look with contact lenses. Glasses can change the appearance of your face and may clash with certain outfits or colors, but contacts offer complete versatility.\\nImproved eye health. Specialized contacts can even reshape your cornea while you sleep! Orthokeratology lenses slow the progression of nearsighted vision, and Lumen Optometric is the only eye doctor in Los Angeles County to fit custom, doctor-designed lenses.\\n\\nContact lenses aren’t the right solution for everybody but if you’re interested in giving them a try, reach out to Lumen Optometric to schedule your contact exam.\\n\\nSchedule a Contact Exam Today\\nWhether you’re motivated by comfort, aesthetics or some other factor, Lumen Optometric can help you with your contact lenses.

Below is a short summary of our COVID-19 protocols:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOur Flow:\\n● We are a specialty-lens practice with a focus on education, quality materials, and patient experience. Our exams slots have always allowed for 45-50 mins for each patient, with 15 mins of buffer time between patients. Our historic scheduling practices align well with COVID prevention measures.\\n● Our doors will be locked, but we’re open! Just knock or call us at (626) 921-0199\\nNegative Pressure Exam Rooms (Updated 7.27.2020)\\n● Our exam rooms are set up as negative pressure rooms, meaning that the air in those rooms is being pulled up and out into the environment. The goal is to ensure that patients aren’t being brought into rooms with stagnant, stale air. To create your own negative pressure system for your home or office, follow the guide Dr. To created here and be sure to download the template for this specific Honeywell HEPA filter.\\n\\nLumen Negative Pressure Template\\nSocial Distancing\\n● Patients can conveniently book an appointment online or through email/call/texts. We require all of our patients to fill out their forms ahead of time and submit them through our secure online portal. Any other required documents can be uploaded to our portal or emailed/texted to us. This helps minimize touchpoints and allows the patient’s examination to begin immediately upon arrival.\\n● Curbside pickup will be available for glasses.\\n● All contact lenses will be shipped directly to patients’ homes/workplaces.\\n● We will only take patients by appointment-only to ensure that we are prepared for each anticipated patient. When a patient arrives, before they are allowed entry, we will perform a wellness screening, touchless temperature check, and provide hand sanitizer. We will require that masks be worn throughout their entire visit.\\n● Our office layout has been restructured to maximize social distancing of our staff and patients. Your Lumen experience will span across four different rooms, with no more than 20 minutes spent in each room to allow for maximal air-cleaning and disinfection.\\n● Patients will only be allowed to bring a guest if they are (1) a minor or (2) need physical or translation assistance.\\nDisinfection/Cleaning – Updated 9.20.20\\n● When you arrive, you can be sure that our office has been thoroughly disinfected.\\n● We utilize a combination of chemical disinfection, UVC disinfection, ozone disinfection, and HEPA-filtration. This will not only take care of our surfaces, but will take care of anything lingering in the air.\\n● For every square foot of patient care areas, we have THREE times the amount of HEPA filtration.\\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) – Updated 8.2.20\\n● Our staff will be wearing masks throughout the day in addition to face shields, depending on the required task.\\n● Staff meetings performed at opening and mid-day will consist of wellness screenings, temperature checks, and a review of our patient list of needs/requirements to make sure we’re operating in a safe, efficient manner.\\n● Acrylic barriers will be in place in areas where face-to-face communication is unavoidable.\\n● Our staff will be taking daily inhaled doses of Iota-carrageenan, which is a polymer derived from red seaweed that has demonstrated inhibitory activity against coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses. To read more, click here and follow the links within for additional research.\\nIf you have any other suggestions, please feel free to contact us and let us know! We take these matters seriously and we are confident our social distancing, PPE, and disinfection protocols will be the best protection for keeping you healthy.\\nThank you in advance for your patience and compliance with our modified COVID protocol. Stay healthy!\\n-Dr. Eric To\\n*Last updated 7.27.2020\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

As the only neurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley, Lumen Optometric customizes state-of-the-art lenses that bring clarity and comfort to patients suffering from migraines, neck strain, tired eyes and more. Our goal is to help your eyes and head feel less tortured at the end of the day, so if you suffer from any of the following symptoms, Lumen Optometric can help:\\n\\n>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Neurolens Therapy Works\\nYour brain is constantly in communication with your two eyes, keeping them aligned and in sync to help you see the world without double vision. If your eyes are misaligned, however, your brain struggles to maintain balance. Without this balance, you could experience constant headaches, migraines, tension in and around your eyes, dizziness and even neck stiffness. Add misalignment to the strenuous demands that computer screens, phones and other digital devices place on your visual system, and you could face daily suffering. Fortunately, 10 years of research into headaches and their associated visual symptoms has yielded the revolutionary neurolens treatment.\\nNeurolens therapy helps correct misalignment at the distance where you need the most help. Whether you struggle to see far away or up close, Lumen Optometric can provide customized neurolenses that correct your specific misalignment and give you the most comfortable vision possible. Lumen Optometric is proud to offer this exciting new technology and we’d love to help you discover relief for your symptoms! Check out the following video for a neurolens overview, and then read on for answers to some of the FAQs we receive.\\nNeurolens FAQ\\nWhat makes this any different than the glasses I wore in the past?\\nThe difference is in the technology and the visual experience. Neurolenses utilize patented, clinically tested technology to correct your misalignment at your prescribed working distance. There is no lens on the market that offers the same technology. And Lumen Optometric keeps several sets of neurolens prescriptions on hand, so if you are a candidate for a neurolens treatment, you’ll have the opportunity to see and feel the neurolens difference at the end of your exam!\\nHow do you measure my misalignment?\\nLumen Optometric utilizes a sophisticated instrument called the SightSync to measure your eye misalignment at varying distances. Coupled with specialized in-office testing, your eye measurements allow us to create a lens that helps with your specific symptoms.\\nHow quickly can I expect my symptoms to improve?\\nMost Lumen Optometric patients notice an improvement within the week, although patients with extremely chronic conditions may require six to eight weeks to notice an improvement.\\nAre there any side effects to the neurolenses?\\nFirst-time neurolens wearers typically report feeling lighter, as if there’s less burden on their heads, necks, shoulders and eyes. But, as with any new type of lens, you may feel disoriented for about a week as your brain adapts.\\n\\nSchedule an Evaluation Today\\nIf you work on the computer for a good chunk of the day, suffer from migraines or experience dry eyes, let Lumen Optometric put relief in sight. We’re the only eye clinic in the San Gabriel Valley to offer neurolens treatment technology. In fact, we’re only the sixtieth clinic in the world to offer the neurolens! To learn more about our state-of-the-art neurolens treatment or to schedule an evaluation, please call our friendly team at (626) 921-0199 or contact us online.\\n\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

It is a revolutionary system that accomplishes three things-it corrects your vision while you sleep, removes the need for daytime distance glasses/contacts, and allows you to avoid dryness, irritation, or allergies with traditional contacts. \\xa0\\nHOW IT KEEPS YOUR EYES HEALTHY:\\nRelative to wearing soft contacts, which are worn for a period of 12-18 hours a day, Ortho-K lenses are only worn while you sleep, so the overall wear-time is much less. Additionally, these lenses are only worn under clean conditions (you’re at home!) so there’s much less of a chance of allergies and virus/bacterial deposits.\\nHOW IT GIVES YOU CLEAR VISION:\\nYou wear a special retainer-like lens to sleep and upon waking, you remove the lenses. When the lenses are off, you will be able to see clearly for the rest of the day. Glasses or traditional contacts will never have to be worn again for the distance so long as you wear your Ortho-K lenses to bed every night. Depending on your needs for reading, Ortho-K can be modified to enhance your reading vision, but reading glasses might still be needed depending on your age and intensity of your near-work.\\nWHAT ELSE MAKES ORTHO-K UNIQUE?\\nOrtho-K is only worn while in the comfort and cleanliness of your own home so you will never have to worry about losing/breaking/tearing glasses/contacts while at work or participating in sports. It is a great option for farsighted patients who are having trouble adapting to wearing glasses. Additionally, it is also a wonderful option for athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, or patients with dry eyes or severe allergies who can no longer tolerate soft contact lenses.\\nTo learn more about how Orthokeratology works, click here. \\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

We have a longer list that can be emailed as well.\\n\\nI just have to sleep in these lenses to see clearly?\\nYes, the lenses gently mold your eyes while you sleep. As long as you sleep in the lenses for a continuous 6-8 hours, your vision will reach full, waking-hour clarity within a 1-2 week time frame.\\nSo what do I wear in the meantime in those first 1-2 weeks?\\nDuring your transition period and depending on the size/type of your prescription, you will be given soft contacts or loaner glasses to ease the transition.\\nWhat can I expect during the first 1-2 weeks?\\nYour vision will become clearer day by day, and the clarity will last longer and longer with each passing day. But during the first couple of weeks, your vision will go from clear to your original level of blurriness by the day’s end. The period of blurriness decreases with each day until full clarity is reached.\\nHow does the lens feel?\\nThe lens is made with a more rigid material, so initially it’s more noticeable and requires a little more adaptation. The good news is that since the lenses are inserted right before bedtime, most of the adaptation takes place while you sleep!\\nHow long does the Ortho-K effect last after the initial transition period?\\nThe vision-correcting effect is programmed to last for ~24 hours, but some patients can experience clear vision for 36 hours without having to rewear the lens. How long your vision remains clear after 24 hours depends on the size of your prescription.\\nIs vision clear while I’m wearing the Ortho-k lenses?\\nYes, vision is very clear with the lenses on.\\xa0 They are designed not only to mold the cornea, but to also give you clear vision if you have to wake up in the middle of the night (for the restroom, emergency evacuations, etc).\\nWhat happens if I miss a night?\\nPatients with lower prescriptions don’t notice an obvious difference the next day, but patients with higher prescriptions will notice blurriness in the distance. Computer tasks for patients are definitely workable if you miss a night, but night driving is not recommended. Soft contacts can be given to you to make up for any residual blur.\\nWhat happens if I decide to stop Ortho-K?\\nYour vision returns to normal over 2-3 weeks, sometimes faster.\\nAre there any side-effects to Ortho-K?\\nGlare is the primary side effect, which occurs with any refractive procedure such as LASIK/PRK/SMILE/etc as well. Glare tends to be more noticeable in the initial adaptation period, which lasts 1-2 months. After that period, the brain learns to adapt and filter out residual glare.\\nI thought it was unhealthy to sleep in contacts?\\nPatients are told not to sleep in traditional contacts because they’re worn throughout the day, throughout sleep, and again in the daytime for a minimum of at least 30 hours of wear time. Additionally, debris/germs/mucus accumulate on traditional lenses, which your eye is then exposed to for the 30+ hours of wear. With Ortho-K, you only wear them for a period of 7-8 hours maximum while under clean, home conditions.\\nLastly, to read about the difference between how Orthokeratology designs differ between adults and children, click here.\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

Ortho-K works by gently reshaping the front surface of the eye (the cornea) while you sleep. The retainer lenses are inserted right before bedtime and removed after waking. Because the lenses are designed to correct your vision overnight, you will wake up with vision that will remain clear throughout your waking hours. The lenses are then re-worn nightly to maintain clear vision.\\nRecent advances in technology have allowed us to design Ortho-K lenses that are created 100% from the shape of your eye. The custom nature of the lens allows for a healthier fitment. Additionally, custom lenses work more quickly and will allow you to reach a clear endpoint in a shorter time period\\nTo learn about the safety profile of Ortho-K, continue reading here.\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

Medmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300” being the gold standard topographer for over a decade. Their newest topographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more accurately capturing your cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your eye, which yields faster, healthier, and clearer outcomes.\\nWAVE CUSTOM LENS DESIGN\\n\\nLumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles County that employs WAVE to create 100% fully-custom lenses for your eyes. WAVE combines all the topographical (corneal shape) data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and manipulate every aspect of your lens design. Custom design software is extremely critical for both clarity and eye health because each point of the lens is based on information from your cornea.\\nTip for inquiring patients – If you are told that you’re being fitted with custom lenses, ask to see your design. It should look similar to the screenshot above. If a doctor touts that they’re fitting a custom lens but is unable to show you a screenshot like the above where they can manipulate every aspect of every curve, they’re not designing a custom lens. All doctors will refer to their lenses as custom, but it is actually quite rare because of the difficult training, complicated CAD software, and cutting-edge equipment that is required.\\nYou must have some questions for us by now!

If your vision and comfort are lacking because of these complications, don’t settle. Sclerals\\xa0represent the gold standard keratoconus treatment that is non-surgical. Dr. Eric To is the only practice-owning optometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society. We’d love for you to experience effortless vision, so reach out and let Lumen Optometric restore clarity and comfort to your vision.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScleral FAQs\\nAs a leading scleral optometrist, Lumen Optometric has the information you need. To give our valued patients more detailed insight about scleral lenses, we’ve compiled a convenient list of FAQs.\\nWhat are scleral lenses?\\nScleral lenses are large-diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (the clear window of the eye) and gently rest on the sclera (the white, outer layer of the eye).\\xa0 The rigid nature of the lenses makes your vision extremely crisp. Scleral lenses should not be confused with traditional gas permeable (GP) lenses. Traditional GP lenses are small lenses made of durable plastic that sit on the extremely sensitive cornea. Conversely, scleral lenses tend to be much more comfortable because they settle on the less-sensitive sclera.\\nWho is a candidate for scleral lenses?\\nMany patients can benefit from scleral lenses, especially those suffering from:\\n\\nKeratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration\\nHigher prescriptions & visual needs that aren’t met by glasses or soft contacts\\nDry eyes, with or without soft contacts\\nGlare/distortion after LASIK, PRK or corneal transplants\\nExacting visual demands from things like sports, videography & photography\\n\\nWill I see a difference between scleral lenses and soft contact lenses?\\nScleral lens prescriptions offer greater vision and comfort than soft contact lenses because:\\n\\nScleral lenses are built from highly customizable materials that offer the clearest, most stable vision correction.\\nScleral lenses sit on the less-sensitive part of the eye and are inherently more stable.\\nScleral lenses offer options that make them more customizable for full distance clarity or for improved reading vision.\\n\\nDo all eye doctors fit scleral lenses?\\nNot all eye doctors fit scleral lenses, but Lumen Optometric specializes in advanced scleral fitting! Our talented scleral optometrist uses an sMap3D instrument to capture a full 3D representation of your frontal eye. That custom scan helps us build a Scleral 2.0 lens that accurately fits your eye. Lumen Optometric is the only provider in the San Gabriel Valley to offer this state-of-the-art technology, and we liken the process to creating a 100% custom-made suit. Like a tailor designing a suit based on every measurement of your body, Lumen Optometric creates a scleral lens that is more accurate and a healthier fit for your eyes.\\n\\nWhat is a Scleral 2.0 lens?\\nTraditional sclerals, or scleral 1.0 lenses, have been used for roughly a decade. The newer, more technologically advanced Scleral 2.0 lenses are customized specifically for your eye. So while creating a Scleral 2.0 lens is comparable to designing a custom-made suit, fitting scleral 1.0 lenses is similar to modifying an off-the-rack suit: you select a suit size that approximates your body shape and make a limited number of adjustments to help the suit drape over your body’s contours.\\nOur mission at Lumen Optometric is to aim for a flawless fit with your scleral lenses, not a best-guess approximation. Check out these videos to see what a difference customized scleral lenses can make!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s it like to be fit with Scleral 2.0 lenses?\\nAn advanced scleral lens fitting starts with both corneal and scleral topography. A corneal topographer maps the cornea, the clear window of the eye. Scleral topography is a separate, dedicated instrument that can scan the elevation changes of your eye’s white surface. This painless procedure does not require dilation drops, but it does require the use of a temporary dye that enhances our scans. We then place a calibrated “test” scleral lens on your eye. That test lens gives you an opportunity to try out a scleral lens and gives us time to fine-tune your prescription. Once your prescription data is obtained, it’s combined with the shape data to create your fully customized scleral lens.\\nPlease note that during a scleral lens consultation, we take all necessary measurements of your eye. Be prepared to set aside 60 minutes of eye doctor time to ensure that the measurements are correct.\\nWhat is the best keratoconus treatment for me? Or if I have pellucid marginal degeneration or any other condition where the cornea is no longer consistent in its shape (post-LASIK/RK/corneal transplant), how will sclerals help me?\\nSclerals are the best keratoconus treatment available, they’re the gold standard! They will give you clear, distortion-free vision. Think of an irregular cornea as the warped windshield of a car. That warping distorts what you see through the windshield, leading to extreme glare in addition to distorted vision. When you fill a custom scleral lens with conditioning solution and apply it to your eye, the solution “mates” the scleral with your cornea to give you a new, smooth, regular surface to see through. This perfectly contoured surface cancels out your distortion and blur, leaving you with clear and comfortable vision. The outcomes are the same for keratoconus, pellucid, or any other type of corneal irregularity.\\nIf I’m already wearing glasses or contacts and I see acceptably, will scleral lenses make a difference?\\nThat depends on how you define acceptable. Most people are fairly adaptable to the options they’re given, so until you’re shown a difference, you may not be aware that the potential for improvement exists. For example, if you’ve been wearing the same set of contacts for nearly a decade, there’s a good chance you’re missing out on clearer, healthier and more comfortable technology. Lumen Optometric can keep you up-to-date on the best and healthiest options for your only set of eyes.\\nThe impact of scleral lenses also depends on your prescription. If you have an extremely minimal prescription, scleral lenses will be more helpful in correcting dry eyes or performance-based vision. If you have a moderate or high prescription with astigmatism, the benefit of sclerals will be vision that’s clearer and more stable. Visual stability is something many of us take for granted until we are shown what true stability looks like. For example, consider the fluidity of the newer 120hz televisions relative to their older 60hz counterparts. 60hz televisions looked normal to us until the 120hz upgrades were released. When patients have high levels of astigmatism, scleral lenses provide results similar to that of seeing an image on a brand new, high-definition television for the first time!\\nCorneal health is another factor to consider. If you have any corneal issues, scleral lenses will significantly impact your vision and improve your quality of life.\\nIf my eyes are dry, how can sclerals help me?\\nWhen you apply a scleral lens to your eye, the “bowl” of the lens is filled with sterile conditioning solution. This conditioning solution is held against your eye for as long as you wear the lens, creating a moisture chamber that helps alleviate your dry eye. Of course, scleral lenses represent only one treatment modality within a greater dry eye treatment system. Severely chronic dry eye patients may need additional treatments to overcome their dryness symptoms, and Lumen Optometric has several dry eye treatment plans available.\\n\\nSchedule an Appointment Today\\nLumen Optometric combines the latest technology with advanced training to provide the clearest and healthiest vision for our patients.

Researchers believe that the environment kids grow up in today, with too many close distance activities (like reading and device use) and lack of outdoor play, is contributing to the rapid increase in childhood myopia. While glasses and contact lenses compensate for a child’s blurry vision, they don’t stop your child’s vision from continuing to deteriorate. As children grow, myopia often develops as they reach school age and progresses into their late teens or early twenties.\\nThe Dangers of Myopia\\nResearchers now know there is more to worry about with myopic eyes than the inconvenience of ever-thickening lenses. Scientific evidence has proven that myopic patients are more vulnerable to a range of sight-threatening diseases and complications. In fact, myopia is the sixth leading cause of blindness. Patients with mild myopia have a four-fold increase in the risk of retinal detachment. For those with moderate to severe myopia, the risk increases ten times. One study concluded that more than 50 percent of retinal detachments not related to trauma are associated with myopia. Other myopia risks include glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration.\\nMyopia Can Be Managed\\nThe dangers of myopia, in conjunction with the normal challenges of subpar vision, mean it is important for parents of myopic children to manage the condition as part of your child’s eye health. The goal of myopia management is to slow the progression of myopia and reduce its impact on your child’s life. The younger myopia management begins, the more effective the treatment.\\nWe are excited at Lumen Optometric to announce the launch of our children’s myopia management service in partnership with Treehouse Eyes®, the country’s leading myopia management service. The revolutionary system, designed to treat your child’s myopia and significantly reduce the threat of more serious eye diseases, is one of the most important innovations since glasses were first prescribed hundreds of years ago!\\nPatient Testimonials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearning More About Myopia and Your Child’s Eyes\\nWe have created an easy-to-follow guide on what myopia is, the treatments available, and how our program works to monitor your children’s eye health.

This front-to-back elongation moves the retina (the screen) beyond the point where the cornea (the projector) expects to concentrate its light to a focus.  \\nSO WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM?\\xa0\\nWhen the outer shell of the eye (the sclera) elongates, it forces all the internal components that line the inside of the eye (the retina) to also stretch. There are two problems with an enlarged eye and a stretched retina:\\xa0\\nProblem #1 – A nuisance\\xa0\\nYour child has to wear stronger glasses/contacts every time their prescription increases. They become dependent on glasses/contacts from the moment their eyes open in the morning to when their eyes close for bedtime.\\nProblem #2 – A health concern\\xa0\\nThe stretched retina is thinned and weakened, which leads to a higher risk of blinding eye diseases, such as myopic maculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts.\\xa0\\nWHAT DO THOSE EYE DISEASES LOOK LIKE & WHAT ARE THE INCREASED RISKS?\\n\\n Parents often ask, “Is my child’s myopia hereditary?

IS IT NATURE OR NURTURE? \\n\\nThe bad news: there is a clear connection between parents passing their nearsighted genes to their children.\\xa0\\nThe good news: your genetics are not entirely to blame! Even though myopic inheritance has been established, the steep rise in myopia over the past 50-60 years cannot be due to inheritance alone.\\xa0\\nIn the graph above, you will notice that in the 1940s, the prevalence of myopia in this select group of East Asian university students was 10% to 37%. If you fast forward to the present, the prevalence is staggering; it is over 80% to 90%! It is impossible for such a sudden shift to have occurred in the gene pool of those nations—so the cause cannot be genetics alone.\\nIn looking for the cause of this progression, researchers studied the visual demands of those university students. It was demonstrated that the average student in Shanghai was responsible for 15 hours of homework per week, compared to 6 hours per week in the United States. Even though the prevailing thought that excessive close work leads to more myopia, they found something else more interesting. They found that it was the lack of outdoor time that led to an earlier and more rapid nearsighted progression! One thing that is clear based on the epidemiological studies, and it is that genetics alone cannot account for this explosive myopic epidemic.\\n\\nARE ELECTRONIC DEVICES HARMING MY CHILD’S EYES?\\nThe answer is a complicated “yes.” The logic of excessive screen time worsening vision is sound, but there has been no conclusive evidence that screen time alone contributes to myopic progression. What is known is that with every moment our children are spending time indoors with their eyes glued to screens, they are not spending those moments outdoors. This is where science has stepped in to find a strong correlation between outdoor playtime and the slowed or delayed onset of myopia. Children who spend a couple of hours outdoors every day have been found to be four times less likely to become myopic.\\xa0\\nOur stance when it comes to screen time is both scientifically-driven and rooted in common sense. Being outdoors provides the healthy sunlight our eyes and skin need. It’s also fantastic for both physical and visual development. Being less sedentary and more active outdoors enforces better hand-eye coordination, depth perception, and eye coordination skills. All efforts should be made to reduce screen time when possible for these reasons.\\nClick here to learn about the treatments available to slow or stop the progression of your child’s myopia.\\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

We utilize optical biometry for a different reason: to measure the length of your child’s eye, which is referred to as axial length. As your child grows, their eyes grow as well. Our goal is early detection and differentiation between natural growth of the eye versus accelerated myopic progression. Since a longer eye leads to a stretched retina (which has its own complications as seen in the “Is Myopia Unhealthy” page), it’s critical that we know the rate at which your child’s eyes are growing.\\xa0\\nPreviously, the only known method to monitor the eye’s growth was through the prescription, but each prescription does not correlate with a specific eye length. Typically, prescription changes lag axial length changes, which means that if you only monitor through prescription, chances are that you will miss length changes that may have already occurred.\\xa0\\nTreehouse Eyes affiliates such as our office are one of the few offices in all of Los Angeles County that employ technology solely to measure axial length for children.\\n\\nMedmont Meridia Corneal Topographer\\nA leading-edge topographer is critical to monitor how the cornea (the clear window of the eye) changes over time with myopia treatments. Medmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300” being the gold standard topographer for a decade. Their newest topographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more accurately capturing your child’s cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your child’s eye, which yields faster and better outcomes.\\nMedmont partnered with Lumen Optometric to help launch the new gold standard and we’re proud to be able to offer this latest form of technology to our patients.\\n\\nWAVE Custom Lens Design\\nLumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles county that employs WAVE to create 100% fully-custom lenses for your child. WAVE combines all the topographical data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and manipulate every aspect of your child’s lens design.\\xa0\\nFrom a doctor’s perspective, the customizable nature of WAVE allows for (1) maximum myopia management, (2) more accurate vision correction, (3) increasing the level of myopia protection in a lens. For patients, it simply means their eyes are more protected from myopic progression, they see better and arrive at a clear endpoint in less time.\\xa0\\nAren’t All Myopia Management Lenses Custom?\\nDepending on the type of lens a practitioner may be limited to (either due to technology or training), their definition of custom will differ. This is an overview of the three different types of “custom” lenses you will encounter as a patient/parent.\\nBasic custom – These types of ortho-k lenses are similar to off-the-rack suits in that they come in a predefined size. Depending on your needs, the suit is then upsized or downsized to another predefined size. “Basic custom” ortho-k lenses exist in certain parameters and different lenses are selected based on visual estimation. Due to the lack of true personalization, your child can share the same lens design as another patient.\\n Semi-custom – This category of ortho-k lenses begins to incorporate technology such as topography in the design of the lens. Lens design software will use the topographical data to generate a lens off of an pre-established template. To return to the suit analogy, measurements are taken for a suit to be made, but the suits still have certain non-modifiable assumptions made about the proportions. And if a suit has to be modified, you still operate within those non-modifiable template assumptions. \\nFully-custom – WAVE lenses are all fully-custom designs. WAVE lenses incorporate topographical data of the eye which can then be fully-manipulated by a Certified WAVE Designer (CWD). Every aspect of the lens can be changed relative to one another, leading to the most form-fitting and visually effective lens. We utilize WAVE lenses because our patients see the best out of them!\\nTip – If a doctor can’t show you the visual layout of your child’s lens design with numerical readouts of those design elements, it’s likely not a fully-custom lens. If you point to any one aspect of the design and ask for it to be changed in real time for demonstration, yet it can’t, it’s likely not a fully-custom lens. Lastly, fully-custom lenses are all doctor-designed from start to finish, meaning that the lenses are all designed in-house by the same doctor taking care of your child. Basic or semi-custom lens designers outsource their change requests to lens consultants.\\xa0\\nFully-custom lenses require more training to design and troubleshoot, in addition to requiring very specific hardware. We only fit fully-custom lenses because they are the healthiest option for your child.\\nSchedule a Consultation to Discuss Myopia Management\\nLumen Optometric offers consultations to discuss myopia management.

To understand why this occurs, let’s first consider how a perfect eye works.  \\nConsider when conditions are perfect:\\n When light passes through the clear, front window of the eye (cornea), it is focused on the inner lining of the eye (retina). Here’s an analogy (Figure 1): think of the cornea as a movie projector, with the retina as a projector screen. The projector and the screen are 20 feet apart, and the projector casts its image 20 feet away onto the screen. The result is a clear image. \\n\\nConsider when the conditions are imperfect:\\nA nearsighted eye is longer, which causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it, leading to a blurry image (Figure 2). Imagine the projector casting an image 20 feet away, but with the projector screen now sitting 25 feet away, which leads to a blurry, out-of-focus picture.\\xa0\\nBelow is an animated video describing the above concepts:\\n\\n\\nFor the next in this series, titled “Is Myopia Unhealthy,” please click here to learn more. \\nAllow us to take part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.
