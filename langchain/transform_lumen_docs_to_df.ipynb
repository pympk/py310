Given its complexity, it’s essential\\nto understand the facts about the condition rather than believing the common\\nmyths often shared online or by friends and family. Knowing more about AMD can\\nhelp you take steps to prevent or delay its progression, so here are\\nstatements you can overlook to maintain your vision for years to come. Myth\\n#1: AMD Is a Disease That Only Affects Older Adults AMD is an eye condition\\ncaused by deterioration in part of the retina, called the macula. This area at\\nthe back of your eye helps you see things with sharp detail and color when\\nlooking straight ahead—for example, when reading or driving a car—but it does\\nnot affect peripheral vision like looking out into the distance around you.\\nWhile researchers are still working to understand what causes this macular\\ndegeneration, it’s likely due to age combined with other risk factors such as\\nsmoking, obesity and genetics. Who is at risk of AMD? People over age 50 have\\nan increased risk of developing early stages of this condition; however,\\nyounger people may also be diagnosed if they have certain genetic mutations\\nassociated with these conditions. Myth #2: There Is No Cure for AMD Though\\nthere currently isn’t a cure for late-stage AMD, treatments are available\\ndepending on which type has been diagnosed. Dry AMD has no treatment yet, but\\nrecent studies indicate that some dietary changes may slow its progression.\\nLifestyle changes that can help include eating leafy green vegetables rich in\\nlutein and zeaxanthin, as well as omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil might\\nreduce inflammation throughout your body, including within your eyes.\\nSimilarly, maintaining good overall health by exercising regularly, eating\\nhealthy foods, quitting smoking and protecting yourself from UV light will\\nhelp lower ocular inflammation. Myth #3 All Vision Loss From MDM Is\\nIrreversible Treatments such as intravitreal injections of anti-vascular\\nendothelial growth factor medications and photodynamic therapy can help\\nimprove vision in some cases. Other treatments such as laser therapy,\\nvitrectomy, cataract surgery and low vision aids can also help reduce AMD’s\\neffects. Early diagnosis and management are key to preserving your sight\\nlonger with AMD. Time to Get Checked If you are over 50 or have any other risk\\nfactors for developing AMD, you should get an eye exam with your doctor. If\\nyou live in the Sierra Madre area, Lumen Optometric can provide comprehensive\\neye exams to help detect AMD early and offer recommendations for treatment and\\nmanagement. We also provide other ophthalmologic services and products, such\\nas contact lenses and orthokeratology. Call us today at (626) 921-0199 to\\nschedule an appointment.

That’s\\nwhy millions of people wear these lenses for several hours on a daily basis.\\nHowever, despite being a common device used to correct vision, it’s not\\nunusual for some contact lens wearers to forget a thing or two about contact\\nlens safety. Generally, contact lenses are safe when they are worn responsibly\\nand cared for properly. Whether you are new to wearing contacts or you have\\nbeen a long-time contact lens wearer, make sure that you follow these 10\\nimportant rules listed by neurons treatment expert Lumen Optometric. Don’t\\nsleep in your contact lenses. Closing your eyes while wearing your lenses\\nreduces oxygen and makes the surface of your eye more vulnerable to\\ninfection.Don’t wear your contacts when you are in the shower, swimming pool,\\nocean, or hot tub. Tap water, seawater, and the water from lakes, rivers, and\\npools harbor organisms that can cause an eye infection.Have your contact\\nlenses fitted by a qualified eye care professional. And make sure to follow\\ntheir instruction on when to replace your contacts. Using lenses for longer\\nthan the manufacturer’s recommendation will increase your risk for eye\\ninfection as protein buildup could occur. If you are also using dry eye\\ntreatment, ask your doctor about precautions on wearing contacts, if\\nany.Always use fresh contact lens solutions every time you store your contact\\nlenses in their case. Never reuse solution or top off old solution since the\\ndisinfecting ability of the old solution is already gone.Never use saline\\nwater for disinfecting or cleaning your contact lenses. Saline solution is\\njust sterile saltwater, so it has no ability to clean or disinfect\\ncontacts.Wash your hands with soap and water before touching your contact\\nlenses. Make sure to completely rinse and dry your hands.Clean your contact\\nlens case using a multipurpose contact lens solution. Let it dry during the\\nday and make sure to replace it every month.Check your contact lenses for\\ntears or chips. Although these lenses are soft, a tear or a chip can still\\nscratch your eye. It’s best to discard your lenses if they have been\\ndamaged.Discard your lenses if they land on the floor or in the sink.If you\\nare using reusable lenses, make sure to rub the lenses with a multipurpose\\ncontact lens solution. This will help remove debris or protein buildup. Lumen\\nOptometric Need to consult a scleral optometrist? Visit Lumen Optometric to\\nget excellent and personalized eye care services.

The obvious\\nbenefits of fresh air and physical exercise aren’t the only perks for kids who\\nplay outdoors. Recent research shows that increased “sun time” can actually\\nslow down the progression of myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), or\\neven postpone its onset! But First, What Is Myopia and Why Is It Harmful?\\nMyopia is an eye disease that causes the eye to elongate more than it should,\\nresulting in blurry distance vision. It’s caused by a combination of genetic\\nand environmental factors, two of which are not spending enough time outdoors\\nand doing excessive near work like device use. Many parents aren’t aware that\\nchildhood myopia significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye\\ndiseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular\\ndegeneration later in life. It’s been shown that higher myopia is associated\\nwith a greater risk of eye disease. That’s why it’s important to stop myopia\\nin its tracks with myopia management. 3 Reasons Why Outdoor Play Benefits Your\\nChild’s Eyes Whether your child is currently nearsighted or not, spending time\\noutdoors in the sunshine can help delay the onset of myopia or slow its\\nprogression. 1\\\\. The Brightness of the Sun The sun’s visible light is\\nsignificantly brighter than the lighting in almost any indoor setting, which\\nmay play a major role in controlling myopia. Studies have shown that when\\nsunlight comes in contact with the retina, it causes the release of dopamine\\ninto the eye. This may prevent the eye from elongating. Preventing the eye\\nfrom growing too long is the main goal of myopia management. What is certain:\\nchildren who spend at least 2-3 hours playing outdoors in the sunshine\\nprogress less rapidly than children who spend almost all their time indoors.\\n2\\\\. Long-Distance Focusing It is well established that prolonged near\\nactivities like reading and screen time contribute to myopia onset and\\nprogression. It’s no surprise that studies now show COVID-19 confinement may\\nhave caused higher rates of myopia in children as well. Spending time\\noutdoors, on the other hand, encourages your child to focus on distant objects\\nlike trees, basketball hoops, a ball flying through the air— anything that’s\\nmore than an arm’s length away. 3\\\\. Vitamin D Vitamin D helps smooth muscle\\ntissue around the eye’s crystalline lens allowing it to function properly.\\nThis smooth muscle helps focus light on the retina, and may also help maintain\\nthe proper eye shape and length between the lens and the retina, which can\\nbecome distorted as a child’s eyes grow with every passing year. Moreover, the\\nsun’s invisible UVB light triggers Vitamin D production. Some studies have\\nfound that nearsighted individuals have lower levels of Vitamin D than those\\nwith normal vision. However, more research is needed to solidify this claim,\\nas only small-scale studies have been performed. The recommended time for\\ndaily outdoor play is at least 2 hours for children over the age of 6. Be sure\\nto send your child outside with a water bottle, sun hat, sunglasses, and\\nsunscreen. At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to battle childhood myopia and\\npreserve children’s eye health for the long term. We encourage parents to\\nlearn more about myopia and check out real stories from satisfied parents and\\nchildren sharing their experiences with our professional doctors, staff, and\\nmyopia treatment protocols at Treehouse Eyes.

The more you know about\\nworkplace eye safety, the better you can protect your eyes and the longer you\\ncan enjoy clearer and healthier vision. Lumen Optometric, the area’s leading\\nspecialist in corneal reshaping and other eye care services, shares some of\\nthe things you can do to protect your eyes in the workplace. 1\\\\. Wear the\\nnecessary eye protection. Those whose career is in construction work,\\nengineering and landscaping tend to be more at risk of eye-related injuries.\\nIf you belong to any of these fields, make sure that you always wear the\\napplicable eye protection. Doing so not only keeps you safe but also ensures\\nyou’ll be able to carry out your tasks in a more efficient manner. 2\\\\. Reduce\\nexposure to blue light. People working in construction, engineering, and other\\nphysically demanding jobs run the risk of developing eye problems, but this\\ndoesn’t mean those working in the office aren’t exempt. Staring in front of a\\ncomputer screen can make office employees more prone to digital eye strain.\\nIts symptoms may include headaches, fatigue, dry and watery eyes, and blurred\\nvision. If you’re experiencing these yourself, schedule a consultation with a\\npremier eye exam doctor like Lumen Optometric promptly. You can also take\\nsteps to lower your eyes’ exposure to blue light. Using an anti-glare screen\\non your computer can help. You may also adjust screen brightness or position\\nthe monitor in such a way that it’s not directly facing a bright light source.\\n3\\\\. Follow the 20-20-20 rule. For every 20 minutes of screentime, take a\\n20-second break and look at an object 20 feet away. You don’t even need to\\nstay seated as you do this. How about taking a quick stroll around the\\nworkplace to give your eyes a much-needed rest? Schedule Your Eye Exam Today\\nFrom workplace eye protection to contact lenses, Lumen Optometric has your eye\\nhealth needs covered. With our advanced and effective eye care solutions,\\nachieving a lifetime of crystal-clear eyesight is easier. Book your\\nappointment by calling us at (626) 921-0199 or filling this out.

By limiting your child’s screen time,\\nyou help your child to experience the many benefits. As a parent, you should\\nbe mindful of how much time your child spends on devices. You might be\\nwondering, how can a parent help in preventing eye diseases in their children?\\nWell, it all starts with limiting screen time. Here are several ways for you\\nto do just that. Set Expectations The first step to limiting your child’s\\nscreen time is to let them know what you expect. Set clear expectations early\\non, explaining why you are limiting their screen time and why it’s important\\nfor them to spend more time playing outside or reading books. If they have\\nconcerns or questions about limiting their screen time, listen and address\\nthem before setting the limit so that they understand why it is important to\\nfollow these rules. You can even make a deal with your child: if they spend 30\\nminutes doing something other than using screens, then they can watch TV or\\nplay video games for 30 minutes afterward (or whatever works best). However,\\ndon’t give in to demands—be consistent! Set a Timer Setting a timer is an\\neffective way to limit your child’s screen time. Not only will it remind them\\nwhen their allotted time is up, but it can also help them keep track of how\\nmuch time they’ve spent on various activities as well. You can choose from\\nseveral apps that are available for download onto your smartphone; or if you\\nprefer, there are physical timers out there as well (like ones with bells). If\\nusing an app, simply select the length of time that you want your child to\\nspend looking at screens and set the alarm accordingly. Once this is done, you\\ncan set up notifications to alert you every hour so that if anything goes\\nwrong—or if any inappropriate material is being viewed—you’ll know about it\\nright away. Create a “Tech-Free” Zone in Your Home You can create a “tech-\\nfree” zone in your home by choosing a room or space that is free of all\\nscreens and then putting them there. This could be your child’s bedroom, or it\\ncould be a quiet spot in the house where you can enjoy each other’s company\\nwithout distractions. This will allow everyone to relax and disconnect from\\ntechnology while they’re at home, which may help prevent screen time overload\\nand overstimulation when using technology later on. Lead by Example The most\\neffective way to control your child’s screen time is by monitoring your own\\nusage as well. While it is important to set limits for your child, you need to\\nbe aware of how much time you are spending in front of a screen as well.\\nChildren will often mimic their parents, so if you want them to cut back on\\ntheir own screen time, then it’s best for parents to do the same thing first.\\nChoose Treehouse Eyes For Better Vision It’s important for your child to\\ndevelop social skills and human interaction. You can’t do this if they’re\\nglued to their screens. It also helps them learn how to manage their\\ndistractions, which is an important life skill that will help them get through\\nthings like school and work.

To ensure\\nthat your child can do well in class, you will need to manage their refractive\\nerror. This usually means going to a trusted local eye doctor for prescription\\neyeglasses. But not every child wants to wear eyeglasses, especially those who\\nare active in sports and other physical activities. This makes contact lenses\\na more attractive option, but is your child actually ready for them? Lumen\\nOptometric, the leading eyecare provider in the area, shares how you can know.\\n1\\\\. Your child is asking if they can wear them. The decision to wear contact\\nlenses will depend on the child. If wearing eyeglasses makes them unhappy and\\nuncomfortable, then they will be far more motivated to take good care of their\\ncontact lenses. 2\\\\. They make an effort to be clean and hygienic. Proper use\\nand care of contact lenses is a big responsibility. Cleanliness should always\\nbe observed to ensure safety and comfort and to prevent infections and other\\neye problems. If your child knows the importance of cleanliness and makes an\\neffort to practice good hygiene, then they should be ready to wear contacts.\\n3\\\\. Your child does their chores without being asked repeatedly. A certain\\namount of discipline is required on the part of the child when it comes to\\ncontact lens use. The proper cleaning and storage of contact lenses are akin\\nto doing household chores. When they don’t need to be told twice about what\\nneeds to be done, then they’re already a good candidate for contact lenses.\\n4\\\\. They are active in sports. Eyeglasses get in the way of your child’s\\nathletic interests. By letting them wear contacts, they can maximize their\\npotential in sports, allowing them to perform well while enjoying clearer\\nvision.

One of these problems is diabetic\\neye disease, which can severely damage your vision. Diabetic retinopathy,\\ndiabetic macular edema, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the conditions that\\nresult from this disease. Fortunately, Lumen Optometric is here to share four\\nsteps you can take to prevent or slow down diabetic eye disease. 1\\\\. Undergo a\\nDilated Eye Exam Annually Diabetic patients are highly advised to visit a\\ndilated eye exam doctor at least once a year. In this assessment, your\\nophthalmologist will identify early signs that diabetes is affecting your\\neyesight. Typically, diabetic eye diseases only show a few symptoms until the\\ncondition has advanced. If your vision starts to blur due to diabetes, consult\\na professional immediately to determine the best treatment for you and save\\nyou from irreversible vision loss. 2\\\\. Manage Your Blood Sugar Keep your blood\\nsugar level in your target range by eating food that is low in sugar and\\ncarbohydrates, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood sugar. For\\npersonalized assistance, consult a primary care physician, an endocrinologist\\nor a nutritionist. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor. 3\\\\. Control\\nYour Blood Pressure Managing blood pressure can protect your eyes from\\ndiabetic retinopathy, which is a complication of diabetes that damages the\\nretina. If your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are high, your tiny\\nfragile blood vessels would react negatively, resulting in serious eye damage.\\nIn the event that your eye condition has worsened, call your eye doctor right\\naway for corneal reshaping or other treatments. 4\\\\. Maintain an Active and\\nHealthy Lifestyle A balanced diet and regular exercise can help control your\\ndiabetes, which can benefit your eye health. As much as possible, avoid\\nconsuming processed and fried food, an excessive amount of red meat, high-\\nsugar beverages, and food with refined carbohydrates. For a hassle-free\\nmealtime, you can ask your diabetic care team to create a meal plan that works\\nfor you and provides you with enough energy to maintain an active lifestyle.\\nFor outstanding diabetic eye care, you can rely on us at Lumen Optometric. We\\nprovide comprehensive eye examinations, contact lenses and other optical\\nsolutions. Schedule an eye consultation by calling us at (626) 921-0199 or\\ncompleting our online form.

Besides giving you the ability to see, they\\nlet you learn new skills and interact with others. Taking good care of your\\neyes goes a long way in maintaining good vision and avoiding sight-threatening\\nconditions. A local orthokeratology specialist gives five tips to keep your\\neyes healthy. 1\\\\. Schedule Regular Eye Exams Routine comprehensive eye exams\\nhelp diagnose various eye conditions in their early stages, including\\nglaucoma, cataracts and age-related eye conditions. Sometimes, they also allow\\nspecialists to catch signs of other health problems, such as diabetes and high\\nblood pressure. How often you need to get your eyes checked typically depends\\non your age and family history of eye disease. You may need to visit an eye\\nexam doctor more frequently if you have an existing medical condition. 2\\\\.\\nKeep Your Eye Prescription Up-to-Date Frequent headaches, constant squinting\\nand blurred vision are common signs you need to update your prescription\\neyewear. If you feel relief when you remove your glasses, it definitely means\\nyou need a new pair. Moreover, experts recommend getting new corrective\\neyeglasses every two years. 3\\\\. Protect Your Eyes From the Sun Your eyes are\\njust as susceptible to sun damage as your skin. When heading outdoors, be sure\\nto wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat is another thing\\nyou can do to protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays. 4\\\\. Maintain a\\nHealthy Diet Eating well-balanced meals will benefit your eyes and overall\\nwell-being. Incorporate foods high in zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins\\nA, C, and E into your diet. Leafy greens, nuts, fish, and colorful fruits and\\nvegetables are especially rich in these nutrients. 5\\\\. Stay Hydrated Your eyes\\ncould suffer if you don’t drink enough water. Blurred vision, eye fatigue and\\na stinging sensation in the eyes are typical signs of dehydration. Drink at\\nleast eight glasses of water daily to hydrate your eyes and body. Don’t wait\\nbefore you experience significant changes in your vision before seeing an eye\\ndoctor. Lumen Optometric is here to handle your eye care needs. Whether you\\nneed new eyeglasses or contact lenses, we’re here to help. Call us at (626)\\n921-0199 or complete our online form to schedule an appointment.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at\\nLumen Optometric share daily habits that can benefit your eyes and vision. 1\\\\.\\nWash Your Hands — Thanks to recent events, hand washing should already be part\\nof your daily routine coming from the outdoors. Even if you stay indoors most\\nof the time, you should wash your hands regularly. Common vision-related\\ndiseases like conjunctivitis (pink eye) are caused by touching in or around\\nthe eyes with unclean hands. 2\\\\. Wear Eye Protection — Whether you’re mowing\\nthe lawn, doing some woodwork in your workshop, or performing home repairs,\\ndon’t risk eye injury and always wear eye protection. Protective glasses are\\neasy to obtain, comes in many sizes, and can be worn over existing eyeglasses.\\nIf you’re working on anything that involves welding, make sure to wear a\\nwelding mask or goggles. 3\\\\. Handle Your Contact Lenses Carefully — Your\\ncontact lenses come into direct contact with your eyes; you’ll definitely want\\nto keep them clean. Always make sure that you’re handling them with clean\\nhands, keep your contact lens cases sterilized, and discard expired contact\\nlens solution. If you’re undergoing dry eye treatment, your eye doctor may\\nprescribe a different type of contact lenses, with different handling\\ninstructions. Make sure you follow them closely to avoid damage to your eyes.\\n4\\\\. Maintain a Healthy Diet — Eating fast food every day probably won’t make\\nyou go blind, but it’s not good for your health, either. Various studies have\\nshown that a diet that contains significant amounts of foods that are rich in\\nOmega-3 and lutein can help reduce the risk of cataracts, night blindness, and\\nother eye problems. 5\\\\. Rest Your Eyes — Most of us spend a significant\\nportion of the day staring at computer screens, especially those who work from\\nhome. Make sure to rest your eyes every once in a while. The “20-20-20 Rule,”\\nis a good daily practice to turn into a habit. The rule is simple: every 20\\nminutes, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Doing this\\nseveral times a day can help reduce eye strain. Lumen Optometric is your\\nleading provider of eye care services, including Neurolens® treatment. Give us\\na call at (626) 921-0199.

But how much do you really know about this\\neye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for\\ntheir child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth,\\nthere’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye.\\nBelow, we’ll explore 5 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more\\nproactive about your child’s eye health and long-term vision. 1\\\\. Myopia is an\\nEye Disease Myopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading\\nlight to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because\\nthe eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should,\\nleading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal\\neye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football.\\nBecause the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it\\nstops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood.\\nThis also means there may be times in a child’s development where they\\nexperience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an\\nincrease in their myopia. 2\\\\. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye\\ndisease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people\\nworldwide. If things don’t change, half of the world’s population will have\\nsome degree of myopia by the year 2050! 3\\\\. It’s a Progressive Condition\\nMyopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school-age\\nyears, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in\\ntandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest\\nof the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be\\ntimes in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and\\nsuddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat\\nmyopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing\\nmyopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they\\nage. 4\\\\. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease Myopic\\nchildren are significantly more likely to develop sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration,\\nand retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50%\\nhigher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop\\ncataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults\\nthan children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of\\nclear vision — a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in\\nthe Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided\\ntheir children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic\\nmaculopathy fell by 40%. 5\\\\. Myopia Can Be Managed At Treehouse Eyes, we know\\nhow important your child’s eye health is to you, and we’re here to help!

In fact, there are many reasons to have them spend time outdoors, not\\nleast of which is to protect your child’s vision. Studies show that children\\nwho spend time playing outdoors in the sunshine experience less myopia\\nprogression than those who stay indoors. Moreover, encouraging more outdoor\\nplaytime is important for promoting overall health and wellbeing in your kids.\\nBelow we’ll explore some fun outdoor activity ideas to try with your kids and\\ndiscuss why spending time outdoors may slow a child’s myopia progression or\\neven postpone its onset. 5 Outdoor Activities to Do With Your Kids This Winter\\n1\\\\. Snow Play If you live in a snowy region, bundle up your kids in warm\\nlayers and have them: ● Build a snowman ● Enjoy a snowball fight ● Paint the\\nsnow with some food coloring or watercolors ● Make a snow maze ● Build an\\nigloo ● Build snow castles (the same way you would sand castles) ● Make snow\\nangels ● Collect snowflakes during a snow flurry and study their beautiful\\nshapes 2\\\\. Blow Ice Bubbles Kids love playing with and popping bubbles. If\\ntemperatures are low enough, they might freeze in mid air! They’ll get a kick\\nout of watching them freeze and possibly catching or popping them. To make\\nyour own bubble solution, mix 1 part water with 4 parts dish soap and a few\\ndrops of light corn syrup. It’s best to try this activity when winds are calm,\\nas harsh breezes can cause the bubbles to pop before they freeze. Once the\\nbubbles have landed on a surface and are completely frozen, they are beautiful\\nto photograph — which can be part 2 of this activity. 3\\\\. Go Sledding Sledding\\nis a classic winter activity that your child will love. To go sledding, all\\nyou need is snow, a sled, and a hill! Easy enough. But before you hit the\\nslopes (or hills), be sure to follow these safety guidelines: ● Choose a sled\\nthat can be steered and can brake ● Wear a helmet ● Dress warmly, but be\\ncareful as the scarf can get caught under the sled ● Children 5 years old and\\nunder should sled with an adult 4\\\\. Go on a Winter Scavenger Hunt A winter\\nscavenger hunt is a wonderful way to explore nature with all of your senses.\\nBefore you head out, make a list of things to see, smell, listen for, and\\nfeel. Ask your child to check each item off the list. For example, your list\\ncan include listening for the sounds of birds chirping, footsteps crunching in\\nthe leaves, or water babbling in a nearby stream. On the list of things to\\nlook for, you can include different types of trees, animals, animal tracks,\\ncloud shapes, birds’ nests, and more. Take your camera along and let your\\nchild take pictures of what they find. You can also leave an empty space on\\nthe list for your child to fill as they explore new things on their own. 5\\\\.\\nDecorate a Tree with Edible Ornaments For Animals This activity is an\\nunconventional twist on building a bird-feeder and perfect for those who live\\nnear a forest. The idea is to make edible ornaments and hang them on a tree\\n(or potted plant in your garden) for wildlife to feed on during the winter.\\nYour ornaments can be made using various seeds, peanut butter, dried fruit,\\nand popcorn. It’s best to use biodegradable materials to hang your ornaments,\\nand don’t use fishing lines, as birds can get caught in it. What’s the\\nConnection Between Time Outdoors and Myopia? There is increasing evidence that\\nchildren who spend extra time daily playing outdoors have a reduced risk of\\ndeveloping myopia; and if they already have myopia, time spent outdoors could\\nslow down the worsening of this condition, also known as myopia progression.\\nThese findings are significant, as having myopia significantly increases a\\nchild’s risk of developing sight-threatening eye diseases later in life.\\nModerate to high levels of myopia make a child more susceptible to developing\\ncataracts, retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and glaucoma later in\\nlife. At Treehouse Eyes, our mission is to battle childhood myopia by\\nproviding myopia management to nearsighted children. Our myopia management\\ntreatments can effectively slow down your child’s myopia progression and\\nreduce their future risk of eye disease. If your child has myopia, or if you\\nneed your first consultation, contact us today to schedule a myopia eye exam.\\nWishing you and all of our patients a healthy and enjoyable winter season!\\nFiled Under: eye care Primary SidebarLatest Post The Manufacturing Process of\\nContact LensesMay 24, 2024Eye Vitamins: Can They Improve Vision?May 20, 2024Do\\nChildren And Teenagers Sleep Habits Affect Their VisionMay 1, 2024Eyeglasses\\nvs. Contact Lenses: Making the Right ChoiceApril 29, 2024Elevate Your\\nPerformance: The Impact of Sports EyewearApril 22, 2024 Category AMD Awareness\\nMonthcovid-19eye careeye healtheye safetyEyesInformationoffice videosvision\\nchanges Archives May 2024 (3) April 2024 (3) March 2024 (2) February 2024 (5)\\nJanuary 2024 (2) December 2023 (2) November 2023 (2) October 2023 (5)\\nSeptember 2023 (2) August 2023 (4) July 2023 (3) June 2023 (3) May 2023 (3)\\nApril 2023 (3) March 2023 (3) February 2023 (3) January 2023 (3) December 2022\\n(1) November 2022 (2) October 2022 (4) September 2022 (3) August 2022 (3) July\\n2022 (2) June 2022 (3) May 2022 (3) April 2022 (3) March 2022 (3) February\\n2022 (2) January 2022 (3) December 2021 (3) November 2021 (3) October 2021 (3)\\nSeptember 2021 (3) August 2021 (3) July 2021 (3) June 2021 (3) May 2021 (3)\\nApril 2021 (3) March 2021 (2) February 2021 (2) January 2021 (3) December 2020\\n(3) November 2020 (3) October 2020 (3) September 2020 (2) August 2020 (4) July\\n2020 (2) June 2020 (3) May 2020 (2) April 2020 (4) March 2020 (2) Allow us to\\ntake part in your vision care and you\\'ll love what you see.

This way, your trusted optometrist\\ncan detect any conditions or diseases that may trouble them later on. Which\\neye conditions are these exactly? Lumen Optometric, the trusted eye exam\\ndoctor in the area, offers a quick overview of some of them. Refractive Errors\\nThese refer to conditions that can cause blurry vision. Refractive errors\\ninclude farsightedness (hyperopia), when close objects appear distorted,\\nnearsightedness (myopia), when objects viewed at a distance are blurry and\\nastigmatism, when objects both near and far are unclear. They may occur when\\nthe cornea doesn’t bend, or refract, light properly. Symptoms include a\\ndisinterest in reading or viewing distant objects and squinting or turning the\\nhead in an odd fashion when watching television. Children diagnosed with\\nrefractive errors can be treated through prescriptive glasses, and even\\ncorneal reshaping, or orthokeratology (Ortho K). The latter refers to the use\\nof gas-permeable lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia,\\nhyperopia and refractive errors. Ortho K is a safe and effective alternative\\nto eyeglasses, refractive surgery, or contact lenses. Amblyopia Another common\\neye problem in babies and young children is amblyopia or ‘lazy eye’. This\\nhappens when the vision of one or both eyes did not develop properly during\\nchildhood, or when eye conditions, such as refractive errors, weren’t\\ncorrected promptly. Strabismus Also known as cross-eyes, strabismus is when\\nthe eyes aren’t aligned properly–instead pointing at different directions.\\nThis causes loss of depth perception because the child learns to ignore the\\nimage received by the misaligned eye, relying only on the one from the\\nstraight, or better-seeing eye. Treatment options for strabismus may include\\neyeglasses and vision therapy. Ptosis When the upper eyelid droops and\\nrestricts or blocks vision, this is called ptosis. A child with this condition\\nmay tip their head back, lift up their chin, or raise their eyebrows to try to\\nsee better, which may cause head or neck problems over time. Visit your local\\neye doctor for a thorough eye exam if your child exhibits these symptoms.\\nColor Deficiency Also called color blindness, this eye problem makes it\\ndifficult for the child to distinguish specific shades of color. This is\\nusually an inherited condition, but there are also certain diseases that can\\ncause color deficits. While there is no cure for color deficiency, there are\\nspecial glasses and contact lenses your child can wear that allow them to see\\ncolor differences. To prevent or avoid lasting vision problems for your child,\\nmake sure to visit a premier eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a regular\\neye exam. We proudly serve Sierra Madre, CA and the surrounding areas. Call us\\ntoday at (626) 921-0199 or fill out this contact form to schedule your\\nappointment.

In today’s\\npost, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at Lumen Optometric shares\\na quick guide on contact lens solutions. Multipurpose Vs. Hydrogen Peroxide\\nSolutions There are two types of contact lens solutions: multipurpose and\\nhydrogen peroxide-based. They serve the same purpose — disinfect your contacts\\nand remove debris — but they work in different ways. Multipurpose solution,\\nalso known as all-in-one solution, is simple to use. Wash your hands, put your\\ncontacts in your palm, then moisten the lenses with the multipurpose solution.\\nWhile some types of multipurpose solutions are marketed as “no rub” products,\\nexperts recommend rubbing the lenses with it for 10 seconds to remove\\nremaining debris. Apply a drop of saline solution in each lense to rinse\\nbefore wearing it. Hydrogen peroxide solution, on the other hand, requires\\nmore time or attention. Unlike multipurpose solutions, this type of contact\\nlens solution does not “spoil,” and is ideal for people who are sensitive to\\ncertain chemicals, or for those undergoing therapy like dry eye treatment.\\nHydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at disinfecting contact lenses,\\nbut it must not touch the eye directly. To use it, fill a small case with the\\nsolution (most contact lenses come with such a case) and soak them for six to\\neight hours. Before taking out the contacts, a neutralizer must be applied to\\nturn the hydrogen peroxide to a plain saline solution. Which One Should You\\nChoose? Between the two, the multipurpose solution is the more cost-effective\\nand easy-to-use, and can be used virtually anywhere as long as you have a\\ncontact lens case or a clean surface to clean them in. However, it is not as\\neffective at disinfecting contact lenses as the hydrogen peroxide solution.\\nMaking it an all-in-one solution requires certain chemicals that may not be\\nideal for some people who may be sensitive to certain substances. This also\\nmeans it has a shorter shelf life. The hydrogen peroxide solution is more\\neffective at cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses, but there is a risk of\\nharming the eye if one were to forget applying the neutralizer. It is also\\nimportant not to reuse or top off the solution after use. Contact lens cases\\nmust also be replaced every one to three months to cut the risk of infection.\\nLumen Optometric is your leading provider of eye care services, including\\nNeurolens treatment.

But apart from\\nthe style of your eyeglass frame, you should also look into the frame\\nmaterials. Lumen Optometric, a trusted scleral optometrist and eyeglass\\nprovider, discusses some of the most popular materials used for eyeglass\\nframes. Titanium Titanium is commonly used in designer glasses. It is an\\nexcellent material for eyeglass frames and hinges because it is very\\nlightweight, sturdy, hypoallergenic and corrosion-resistant. However, titanium\\nis significantly more expensive than other frame materials. Titanium alloy,\\nwhich is a combination of titanium and other metals, is typically used as a\\ncheaper alternative to titanium. Stainless Steel Stainless steel is a reliable\\nmaterial for eyeglass materials. It’s durable, strong, hypoallergenic and non-\\ncorrosive. It may not be as lightweight as other materials, but it can be\\neasily shaped into ultra-thin eyewear frames. Stainless steel is also\\nflexible, and this usually adds to the comfort of eyeglass wearers. So whether\\nyou are wearing glasses most of the time or you’re only using it temporarily\\nwhile undergoing dry eye treatment, this type of frame material can be really\\ncomfortable for you. Plastic Zyl or propionate is typically used in making the\\nplastic frame material. Zyl, which is also known as cellulose acetate, is the\\nmost common type of plastic frame material. Meanwhile, propionate is the\\nsecond most popular plastic frame material. It is hypoallergenic and nylon-\\nbased, and it has a different look and feel than other types of plastic. Lumen\\nOptometric has expertise in different kinds of eye care services. Whether\\nyou’re considering Neurolens treatment or you’re simply looking for a new pair\\nof glasses, our staff will ensure that your needs are met.

What’s less well-known is what these\\ndifferent eye conditions are. Presbyopia is one of these diseases. It’s a\\ncondition that usually affects people aged over 40 and makes it harder for\\ntheir eyes to focus on objects. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing\\nsmall print, such as text messages, clearly. No need to worry though—to help\\nrestore your vision, a scleral optometrist will prescribe you multifocal\\nlenses if you’re a good candidate for one. In general, there are three types\\nof multifocal lenses: Bifocal lenses – As the name suggests, bifocal lenses\\nhave two prescriptions: the upper lens helps you see objects from afar while\\nthe lower lens helps you read and focus on objects near you.Trifocal lenses –\\nLike bifocal lenses, trifocal lenses have upper and lower lenses that help you\\nwith distance vision and reading respectively. The difference between the two\\nis that trifocal lenses, as the name suggests, have a middle section that\\nhelps you with tasks that require intermediate vision, like using a laptop.\\nProgressive lenses – Progressive lens don’t have the lines found on bifocal or\\ntrifocal lenses. That’s because the power of the lenses gradually changes from\\nthe top to the bottom. Adjusting to Your New Bifocal Lenses Multifocal lenses\\nwill take some getting used to. Here are some tips on adjusting to your new\\nmultifocal lenses: Wear your multifocal lenses all the time – You’ll get used\\nto your new multifocal lenses faster if you wear them all the time. Don’t look\\ndown while walking or going down the stairs – The lower part of your bifocal\\nlenses makes everything look bigger, so your feet may appear out-of-focus. If\\nyou need to look down while walking, make sure to tilt your head up and look\\nthrough the upper portion of your multifocal lenses. Make sure your new\\nmultifocal eyeglasses fit your face properly – It’s harder to get used to\\nmultifocal eyeglasses and lenses if they don’t fit your face properly. For\\nmore info about your multifocal lenses, neurolens treatment, and your other\\ntreatment options, don’t hesitate to consult your eye doctor. Looking for eye\\nspecialists near you?

This assessment is crucial to\\ndiagnosing, preventing and treating eye conditions that could lead to vision\\nloss. To help you further understand what dilated eye exams are, Lumen\\nOptometric is here to answer the most commonly asked questions about this\\nprocess. “What Is a Dilated Eye Exam?” A dilated eye exam involves pupil\\ndilation, which is a simple and painless procedure performed to increase the\\nsize of the pupils. This process allows your ophthalmologist to assess the\\nhealth of your optic nerve and retina. If you are nearsighted or farsighted,\\nyour eye doctor will give you dilating eye drops to check vision problems that\\nhinder you from seeing clearly. “What Conditions Can It Detect?” Glaucoma,\\nmacular degeneration, retinal detachment and ocular tumor are some of the\\nconditions that can be diagnosed with a dilated eye exam. This procedure\\nprovides optimum viewing of the dilated pupil, which allows for the diagnosis\\nand monitoring of the retina. While there are some diseases that can be\\ndetected without pupil dilation, a dilated eye exam is still important to\\nensure an accurate and complete diagnosis. “What Can I Expect During the\\nExam?” When your eyes are dilated, your vision may be blurry and your eyes may\\nbe sensitive to light for a few hours. For your safety, ask a loved one to\\ndrive you home from your eye appointment. In case your eye doctor finds\\nrefractive errors in your vision, they may provide you with a prescription for\\neyeglasses or contact lenses to help improve your eyesight. At Lumen\\nOptometric, we are committed to providing only the best eye care services to\\nhelp you take care of your vision problems. To schedule an eye consultation,\\ncall our team at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our online form.

This treatment can help\\nwith tired eyes, eye fatigue and headaches. The neurolenses® that we provide\\nuse patented and clinically tested technology to correct your eyes’\\nmisalignment. Are you curious about the neurolens treatment and want to learn\\nmore? In today’s article, Lumen Optometric answers some frequently asked\\nquestions about neurolenses. How Does It Work? The neurolens Measurement test\\nwill determine if you are a good candidate for neurolenses. These lenses are\\nthe first and only prescription lenses that can help correct the misalignment\\nin a patient’s vision at all distances. Using neurolenses has been found to\\nrelieve symptoms like neck pain/tension, eyestrain, headaches and eye fatigue.\\nHow Often Should I Use It? Your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen\\nOptometric recommends that you wear your neurolenses during all your waking\\nhours for the best results. If this is not possible, then you should at least\\nwear these lenses while doing near work like reading or using a digital\\ndevice. In general, you should see results with your neurolenses within your\\nfirst three to seven days of wearing them. Some patients might take longer\\nhowever, sometimes taking up to three weeks. Does It Still Work If I Use\\nContacts or If I Have 20/20 Vision? Your new neurolenses incorporate both your\\nregular eyeglasses prescription and your contoured prism prescription. If you\\nprefer wearing contact lenses, then you can order your neurolenses to only use\\nyour contoured prism prescription. You’ll just need to wear your neurolenses\\nwhile wearing your contacts. This also means that people with 20/20 vision can\\nstill use neurolenses if they suffer from misalignment. We provide a\\ncomprehensive range of eye care services including dry eye treatment, eye\\nexams and more. Lumen Optometric works with some of the most experienced and\\ndedicated eye doctors and eye care professionals. Our focus is on balancing\\nyour visual health, comfort and clarity.

January 5, 2021 by Lumen\\nOptometric Are Myopia Management Contact Lenses Safe for Children? We meet\\ndozens of parents and children every day who come in for eye exams, myopia\\ntreatments and other services. During these visits, we welcome and address\\nquestions or concerns that parents have about their child’s eye health.\\nBecause certain myopia treatments include contact lens wear, many parents ask\\nwhether they’re safe to wear for young children. Here’s what the research\\nsays: A recent study, Adverse Event Rates in The Retrospective Cohort Study of\\nSafety of Paediatric Soft Contact Lens Wear: the ReCSS Study, shows that\\ncontact lenses for children are just as safe for children as they are for\\nadults. (This study appears in the January 2021 issue of the peer-reviewed\\nJournal of Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics.) The study followed 963 children\\naged 8 to 16 over the course of 1.5 to 3 years (for a combined 2713 years of\\ncontact lens wear time) to determine the risk level associated with wearing\\nsoft contact lenses. All of the subjects were 13 years of age or under at the\\ntime of their first fitting, with more than half of the children fitted with\\nsoft contacts at or before the age of 10, on average. The study results\\nindicate that age doesn’t play a role in contact lens safety. In fact, the\\nrisks of developing adverse reactions to contact lens wear among children\\nproved to be the same as in adults. According to the study, the rate of\\ninflammatory conditions associated with contact lens wear were less than 1%\\nper year of wear. Multifocal Lenses for Myopia Management One effective method\\nof myopia management includes the use of MiSight daily multifocal soft contact\\nlenses. MiSight contact lenses are FDA approved for the treatment of myopia\\nand have been shown to effectively slow down the rate of myopia progression.\\nMany parents like this method as it requires minimal maintenance; at bedtime,\\nthe child discards the pair they are wearing, and inserts a fresh pair in the\\nmorning. It also rids the child of the need to wear glasses during the day,\\nallowing them to freely partake in sports and other activities. The myopia\\nmanagement program at Treehouse Eyes can help preserve your child’s gift of\\nsight for a lifetime. Treating your child’s myopia will give them clear vision\\ntoday, while reducing their chances of developing sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases later in life. it’s never too early to start treating myopia.

November 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Today, you can have\\nyour eyes checked without actually seeing your eye doctor using online vision\\ntests. Many eye clinics offer these tests that you can accomplish via your\\nsmartphone. They claim to determine how sharp your vision is, if you have\\nastigmatism, or experiencing eye sensitivity. Discover if online eye tests are\\nany good and when they are useful from a local eye exam doctor. Are Online Eye\\nTests as Good as Visiting Your Eye Doctor? Typically, an online eye test only\\nchecks your visual acuity and gives an estimate of your refractive error.\\nSometimes, it includes contrast sensitivity and color blindness. However, this\\nkind of test can’t determine if you have conditions like glaucoma, cataracts,\\nor macular degeneration. Keep in mind that routine eye exams with your eye\\ndoctor are still irreplaceable. Get your eyes checked as frequently as advised\\nby your eye specialist. Regular comprehensive eye exams can help with the\\nearly detection and treatment of different eye conditions, especially those\\nthat don’t show symptoms until their later stages. When Are They Helpful? When\\nyou’re away, and you break or lose your glasses or contact lenses, that’s when\\nonline eye tests are most useful. Sometimes, an online vision test can help\\nkeep track of your eyesight and refractive error between routine eye exams.\\nStill, it helps to know that the results of some online eye tests have been\\nvalidated with limited studies because it’s still a new and developing\\ntechnology. More studies are required to ensure the accuracy of prescriptions\\ngenerated by online vision tests. For your family’s eye care needs, turn to\\nLumen Optometric.

At Lumen\\nOptometric, we make use of a sophisticated instrument called SightSync to\\nmeasure your eye misalignment at various distances. An eye exam doctor also\\nconducts a specialized testing to further help us create a lens that can help\\nwith your specific symptoms. How do they work? As mentioned earlier,\\nneurolenses® add a contoured prism, which basically corrects your eye\\nmisalignment. For these lenses to yield the best results, experts recommend\\nwearing them during all your waking hours. If you are not able to do so, it is\\nimportant to at least wear them while you are in front of digital devices.\\nTypically, patients are able to see results within the first three to seven\\ndays of wearing neurolenses®. For others, though, it takes a bit longer to\\nadjust — sometimes up to two or three weeks. At Lumen Optometric, you can rest\\nassured that you are in good hands. Whether you need to come in for an eye\\nexam or corneal reshaping, we can ensure top-notch services and care for you.\\nCall us at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our contact form to schedule an\\nappointment.

While they are\\na common, albeit harmless, condition among infants, blocked tear ducts\\ndeveloping in adults may indicate an underlying problem. Lumen Optometric, the\\ntrusted scleral optometrist in the area, shares more of the essentials you\\nneed to know. What Can Cause Blocked Tear Ducts? There are many different\\nreasons blocked tear ducts can occur. These may develop because of an age-\\nrelated change, when the tiny openings (puncta) that allow tears to drain\\nbecome narrower, which can cause a blockage. Other common reasons include\\ninfection of the eyes, tear duct system, or nasal passages. An injury or\\ntrauma can also result in blocked tear ducts. This can be as minor as foreign\\nparticles getting lodged in the eyes, or as serious as a blow to the head or a\\nbroken nose. What are the Symptoms of Blocked Tear Ducts? Watery eyes and\\nexcess tears streaming from the eyes may be signs of a blocked tear duct. But\\nthese may be accompanied by: Redness and irritation of the affected eyeCrust\\nforming along the eyelidsExcess mucus or discharge from the eyesEye\\ninfections, like pink eye or conjunctivitisPain and inflammation of the inside\\ncorner of the eyeBlurred vision You should note, however, that watery eyes due\\nto cold or sinus infection may be unrelated to a blocked tear duct. The same\\ngoes for swelling or redness in the eyes, which may be a result of an injury\\nthat doesn’t affect the tear ducts. When you’re experiencing some or most of\\nthe symptoms mentioned above, you should go see Lumen Optometric, your trusted\\nlocal eye doctor promptly. We don’t just specialize in dry eye treatment–we\\ncan also manage a number of other eye conditions. How Do You Deal with Blocked\\nTear Ducts? While a blocked tear duct can result in discomfort and swelling,\\nit is almost always correctable. Its treatment will depend on its underlying\\ncause. To accurately pinpoint the reason for your blocked tear ducts, we’ll\\nperform a comprehensive eye examination and, depending on the results,\\nrecommend the effective and appropriate solution. Whether you need to deal\\nwith blocked tear ducts or considering neurolens treatment, Lumen Optometric\\nhas got you covered. We’ll ensure a lifetime of clear and healthy vision with\\nour specialized eye care services. We proudly serve Sierra Madre, CA and the\\nrest of San Gabriel Valley.

January 8, 2021 by Lumen Optometric\\nToday, children are more exposed to digital devices, which makes a lot of\\nparents worry. Using devices like computers, cellphones, and tablets can\\nresult in digital eye strain. One of the things that are believed to help\\nprevent the condition is blue light glasses. Find out if blue light glasses\\ncan protect children against digital eye strain from a scleral optometrist.\\nWhere Does Blue Light Come From? Blue light is visible light with shorter\\nwavelengths but more energy than other light at the other end of the color\\nspectrum. The main source of blue light is the sun but it can also come from\\nyour digital devices, LED lights, television screens, and fluorescent lights.\\nFortunately, there is no known evidence that blue light from screens is\\ndamaging to a child’s eyes. Do Blue Light Glasses Work? Kids who spend hours\\nin front of screens are more prone to develop digital eye strain or computer\\nvision syndrome. Among the most common signs of this eye condition are eye\\nfatigue, headaches, shoulder or neck pain, changes in vision, and dry eye. To\\nkeep track of your child’s vision and ensure their eyes are healthy, visit\\nyour eye doctor regularly. At Lumen Optometric, you can count on us to take\\ncare of your child’s eyes. We specialize in myopia treatment, dry eye\\ntreatment, and more. Blue light glasses are available in prescription and non-\\nprescription lenses. These glasses have a slight yellow tint to the lenses and\\ncan help prevent digital eye strain in children. However, these glasses do not\\ncompletely filter all blue light but they can reduce your child’s exposure by\\nup to at least 80 percent. Still, the best way to prevent this eye condition\\nis limiting your child’s screen time, especially for younger ones. For your\\nfamily’s eye care needs, Lumen Optometric is here to help. We offer neurolens\\ntreatment, scleral lenses, orthokeratology, and more. Call us at (626)\\n921-0199 or fill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

Let’s explore the efficacy of correcting visual habits in\\nmitigating its advancement. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent ocular\\ncondition with multifaceted causes and implications. In this post, we delve\\ninto whether myopia can worsen despite corrected visual habits. The Mechanisms\\nof Myopia Occurrence: The journey of myopia onset is intricate and begins\\nbefore visual symptoms manifest. Research indicates that the eye undergoes\\naccelerated axial growth one to two years before myopia becomes clinically\\nevident. During this period, compensatory mechanisms within the eye attempt to\\ncounteract the elongation, including the flattening of the anterior surface of\\nthe lens. However, these mechanisms eventually exhaust themselves, leading to\\nthe establishment of myopic refractive status—an early-to-mid stage\\nirreversible pathological change. The Influence of Age on Myopia Progression:\\nUnderstanding the age at which myopia sets in is crucial in predicting its\\nprogression. Studies suggest that the earlier myopia occurs and the faster it\\nprogresses, the less responsive it is to interventions aimed at improving\\nvisual habits. This underscores the importance of early detection and\\nintervention in younger individuals to potentially mitigate the severity of\\nmyopia progression. Challenges in Eliminating Causative Visual Habits: While\\ncorrecting visual habits is a fundamental aspect of managing myopia, it’s\\nessential to acknowledge the challenges associated with eliminating causative\\nfactors. Factors such as excessive near work, limited outdoor time, and\\ngenetic predispositions contribute to myopia development. Despite concerted\\nefforts to modify these habits, complete eradication remains elusive, posing a\\ncontinued risk for myopia progression. Conclusion : In conclusion, the journey\\nof myopia progression is complex, and influenced by various factors including\\nage, genetic predispositions, and environmental habits. While correcting\\nvisual habits is beneficial, it’s crucial to recognize the limitations in\\neliminating causative factors. Early intervention remains key in potentially\\nslowing down myopia progression, emphasizing the importance of regular eye\\nexams and proactive management strategies. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed\\nto empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources to navigate their\\nmyopia journey effectively. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment\\nplans for your child.

June 10, 2021 by Lumen\\nOptometric Sleep is crucial to your health and to every part of your body,\\nincluding your eyes. It ensures that your eyes have enough moisture and rest\\nto perform well. If you are not getting enough sleep, this could affect your\\neyes and increase your risks of various side effects ranging from mild (dark\\ncircles and puffy eyes) to severe (eye infections and vision loss). Lumen\\nOptometric, a trusted provider of contact lenses and eye care services,\\nfurther discusses the negative impact of poor sleeping habits on your overall\\neye health. Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Eyes One common but less\\ndangerous effect of poor sleep is having dark circles underneath your eyes.\\nSome people, though, are more prone to having puffy eyes rather than dark\\ncircles after a night of inadequate sleep. In other cases, when people are not\\nable to get enough sleep, they experience eye spasms and twitching throughout\\nthe day. This often makes it difficult to do work or activities like reading.\\nIt can also pose hazards if you are driving. Another usual side effect of\\nsleep deprivation is having strained, dry and itchy eyes the next day. This is\\na slightly more serious effect of poor sleep. Dry eyes specifically can be\\npainful and it can cause irritation. This is mainly because your eyes are not\\ngetting proper lubrication. Lack of sleep may also cause your eyes to be\\nsensitive to light or your vision to be blurry. People who don’t get enough\\nsleep have an increased risk of glaucoma, a condition caused by excessive\\nbuildup inside the eye. If you have been experiencing these symptoms more\\nfrequently, make sure to visit an eye exam doctor. You should also address the\\nsource of your eye symptoms — in this case, poor sleeping habits. Tips on\\nImproving Your Sleep Remember that your eyes go through a lot whenever you’re\\nawake. They work several hours a day, so it is important to give them enough\\ntime to recover through sleep. If you are having problems getting a good\\nquality of sleep, here are some tips that might help you: Exercise regularly.\\nThis can help you sleep better, but make sure to avoid it three hours before\\nyour bedtime.Get as much sunlight as you can during the day.As much as\\npossible, avoid exposure to blue light and digital screens at least two hours\\nbefore bedtime.Consider wearing an eye mask if you get stimulated even by the\\nfaintest of lights at night. You can also try blackout blinds to prevent\\noutdoor lights from seeping into your bedroom.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says 90% of\\nthese incidents are preventable. Generally, the kind of eye protection you\\nneed depends on the potential hazards present in your workplace. A local\\northokeratology expert shares some of the most common causes of workplace eye\\ninjuries. What Are the Common Causes of Workplace Eye Injuries? Flying Objects\\nDoes your job involve sanding, riveting, chiseling, hammering, riveting or\\nmachining? If so, you must wear appropriate eye protection like safety\\nglasses, face shields or goggles. These tasks can expose you to small flying\\nobjects that can enter your eyes, including metal fragments, wood particles\\nand cement chips. Chemicals You must be careful when working with chemicals\\nbecause they can cause irreversible eye damage. Proper safety gear will\\nprotect your eyes from chemical splashes, fumes and vapors. Gasoline, grease,\\noil and paint thinner can also harm your eyes. Object or Tool Penetration\\nPermanent eye damage can occur due to the penetration of tools or sharp\\nobjects. When this incident happens, seek medical attention immediately.\\nAlways wear safety glasses and avoid tools you have no experience using.\\nRadiation Lasers and welding equipment can produce high levels of infrared,\\nultraviolet radiation and heat. Workers need to wear safety goggles when\\nperforming tasks involving these tools. Doing so will protect them from eye\\nproblems like cataracts, retinal burns and blindness. Which Eye Problems\\nUsually Occur at Work? Digital Eye Strain Many jobs today require you to stare\\nat digital screens for hours. If you spend a significant time in front of a\\ncomputer, you might experience digital eye strain. Headaches, dry eyes and\\nblurred vision characterize this condition. It can also cause neck and\\nshoulder pain. These symptoms can occur due to glare on screens, poor seating\\nposture and improper viewing distances. Uncorrected refractive errors like\\nnearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism can also trigger digital eye\\nstrain symptoms. The only way to know if you need prescription eyeglasses or\\ncontact lenses is to get an eye exam. Moreover, taking breaks from computer\\nscreens and ensuring good lighting will help alleviate eye strain. Eye\\nInfection Usually, eye diseases spread in the workplace through droplets from\\nsneezing or coughing. You might develop an eye infection if you accidentally\\ntouch your eyes with contaminated hands. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis\\noccurs from exposure to Staphylococcus species and other bacteria. Its\\nsymptoms include eye redness, burning and a sensation of having something\\ninside the eye. Artificial tears, antibiotics and other topical medications\\nare the common treatment options for this eye condition. Regular visits to\\nyour eye exam doctor will go a long way in keeping your eyes healthy and\\nmaintaining good vision. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care\\nneeds.

You may be dealing with what’s known as\\ncomputer vision syndrome (CVS). An orthokeratology and eyecare expert explores\\nthe causes and symptoms of CVS and how this condition can be corrected. Causes\\nand Symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome Extended screen time, a lack of\\nsufficient lighting, poor posture and bad visual habits can lead to computer\\nvision syndrome. Over time, our eyes have a hard time focusing and refocusing\\non digital screens, causing multiple discomforts. The main symptoms of CVS\\ninclude difficulty shifting focus, dry or itchy eyes, recurrent headaches, and\\nblurred or double vision. In some cases, it may also cause neck, shoulder, and\\nback pain, creating a ripple effect on your overall well-being. Can Computer\\nVision Syndrome Be Corrected? The good news is that computer vision syndrome\\ncan be corrected. It is not a permanent condition, so your vision can improve\\nsignificantly with the right approach and professional help. Here are just\\nsome of the methods that can be employed: Eye Exercises Specific eye exercises\\ncan be suggested by your eye exam doctor to alleviate the symptoms of CVS.\\nThese exercises can help strengthen your eye muscles and improve your eyes’\\nability to focus. Prescription Glasses In some cases, prescription glasses\\nspecially designed for computer use may be recommended. These glasses have\\ncoatings to reduce glare and block harmful blue light emitted by digital\\nscreens. Vision Therapy This is a customized program of visual activities\\ndesigned to correct specific vision problems and improve visual skills. Vision\\ntherapy can help treat CVS by training the eye muscles to reduce strain and\\nimprove visual comfort when using screens. Lubricating Eye Drops Dry eye is\\nanother symptom of CVS, and you can use lubricating eye drops to combat it.\\nThese drops help replenish your eye’s surface and maintain moisture.\\nEnvironmental Modifications This could include adjusting the lighting in your\\nworkspace to reduce glare, positioning your computer screen at an optimal\\ndistance and angle, and increasing the font size on your screen to reduce eye\\nstrain.

During this appointment, your eye care professional\\nwill assess your eyes and determine the most suitable type of contact lenses\\nfor your needs. Here’s what you can expect during your contact lens fitting\\nsession. Assessment of Your Eye Health and Vision Needs Your eye care\\nprofessional will begin by reviewing your medical and eye health history. This\\nexamination includes a check of visual acuity, an evaluation of eye movements\\nand an examination of the general well-being of your eyes to determine whether\\neye conditions might affect your suitability for wearing contact lenses.\\nPrecision Measurements for a Perfect Fit Following the eye health assessment,\\nthe optometrist or ophthalmologist will meticulously measure the curvature and\\ndiameter of your corneas. These measurements are crucial for determining the\\ncorrect size and type of contact lenses that will provide the best fit for\\nyour eyes, preventing discomfort and potential complications. For instance,\\nscleral lenses are larger than standard contact lenses and rest on the white\\npart of your eye, the sclera. Due to their design, optometrists perform a more\\ndetailed fitting process for scleral contact lenses than regular contacts.\\nTailoring to Your Lifestyle and Preferences Your lifestyle and preferences\\nplay a significant role in the recommendation of suitable contact lenses. The\\neye care professional will take into account factors such as your level of\\nphysical activity, preferred wearing schedule and specific vision correction\\nneeds. Communicating your preferences ensures personalized recommendations.\\nFollow-Up Appointment A follow-up appointment is typically scheduled after a\\nweek or two to ensure you adapt well to your new contact lenses. Your eye care\\nprofessional will check for any changes in eye health and may adjust your\\nprescription or lens type if necessary. They can also help you identify issues\\nlike dry eyes that could affect lens comfort and recommend dry eye treatment\\nas needed. Contact lens fitting is a comprehensive process that requires\\nprofessional expertise for the best outcome. Lumen Optometric is a premier eye\\ncare provider dedicated to improving your eye health.

Read on as Lumen\\nOptometric explains why, when, and how your contact lenses may impact your\\nexamination results. Should You Wear or Not Wear Contact Lenses for an Eye\\nExam? Eye exams sometimes involve more than just reading a standard eye chart.\\nThere can be several tests, each targeting a different aspect of your eye\\nhealth. The primary concern with leaving your lenses in during the exam is the\\npotential for inaccuracies. Contact lenses can disguise certain eye conditions\\nor changes in your prescription. They might also obscure indications of dry\\neye, a condition that demands effective treatment early on. As such, it is\\npreferable to take contact lenses out at least two hours before the\\nappointment. Doing so allows your cornea to revert to its natural shape—which\\ncan be altered by prolonged contact lens wear—ensuring a more accurate\\nexamination. Discussing Your Contact Lens Concerns During an Eye Examination\\nDuring your eye exam, be sure to discuss your contact lens experiences with\\nyour eye care provider. This way, they can evaluate your eyes with them on and\\noff. For instance, if you mention issues with blurry vision or eye fatigue,\\nthey might consider a neurolens treatment, a revolutionary option for\\ncorrecting misalignments and bringing comfort. Likewise, if you’re a candidate\\nfor scleral lenses, they will have a specialized understanding of your contact\\nlens fitting. Lenses should not just correct vision but should also promote\\noverall eye health. Reach Out to Lumen Optometric Taking off your contact\\nlenses before an eye exam is often beneficial, allowing your optometrist to\\nconduct a more comprehensive and precise test.

But in order to get\\nthe most out of your contact lenses, you’ll need to make sure they’re worn\\nproperly. Some people, for instance, leave their contact lenses in for too\\nlong, which is risky and highly discouraged. Lumen Optometric, the premier eye\\nexam doctor in the area, explains more. Why You Shouldn’t Overwear Contact\\nLenses Avoid wearing your contact lenses for too long in a day, and you\\nabsolutely shouldn’t leave them on when you sleep. Doing so can lead to\\ncomplications with your eyesight. In fact, prolonged contact lens use may\\ncause the wearer to experience the following symptoms: Inflammation of the\\ncornea, or keratitisRedness and swelling of the conjunctiva, or the\\ntransparent skin covering the whites of the eyesEyelid swellingLight\\nsensitivityBlurred visionDry eyesBurning sensation when the contact lens are\\ninserted But How Long Is ‘Too Long’? The period may vary with each patient,\\nbut it’s generally recommended that contact lenses are worn for a maximum of\\n10-12 hours each day. Anything longer than that can put the eyes at risk of\\ninfection and discomfort. If you’re using contact lenses for the first time\\n(and don’t have dry, sensitive eyes) your eye care specialist may suggest\\nwearing them for 6-8 hours on that first day. How to Deal With Overwear If\\nyou’ve left your contact lenses for too long and are now experiencing adverse\\neffects, the first thing you’ll need to do is visit a trusted eye doctor like\\nLumen Optometric for a comprehensive eye exam and the necessary solution. Our\\neye specialists will suspend contact lens wear until all the symptoms have\\nbeen resolved. As your eyes heal, we may suggest switching to a new lens\\nmaterial with higher oxygen permeability, or recommend using daily disposable\\nlenses.

This\\ncondition pertains to the clouding of the lens of the eye. According to the\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 17.2% of Americans older\\nthan 40 have cataracts in one or both eyes. While a common eye condition, many\\nmyths still surround cataracts. A local orthokeratology specialist debunks\\nfive of them. 1\\\\. Cataracts Only Occur in Older Adults One of the most popular\\nmisconceptions about cataracts is that they only occur in older adults. The\\ntruth is they can be present at birth. Cataracts can also develop in younger\\nindividuals, and some medications can increase your risk for cataracts, such\\nas corticosteroids. 2\\\\. Overusing Your Eyes Can Cause Cataracts How much you\\nuse your eyes doesn’t have anything to do with your risk of developing\\ncataracts. However, cataracts can make doing up-close work more challenging.\\nWhile healthy lifestyle changes can’t prevent cataracts, they can slow down\\nthe eye condition’s progression. 3\\\\. Eye Drops Can Treat Cataracts No eye\\ndrops can prevent or dissolve cataracts. Cataracts are not growths but changes\\nin the structure of the lens. Removing and replacing the affected lens is the\\nonly way to treat this eye condition. If you have cataracts, only an eye exam\\ndoctor can determine which treatment option suits you. 4\\\\. Cataract Surgery Is\\nRisky Cataract surgery is one of today’s safest procedures, with a success\\nrate of 95%. It’s painless and only takes around 15 to 20 minutes. You can\\nusually leave the hospital a few hours following the surgery. Most patients\\nrecover within four weeks, but some notice a significant improvement in their\\nvision a few days after the procedure. 5\\\\. Cataracts Can Go Back Following\\nSurgery Once the affected lens has been replaced, cataracts will not recur.\\nHowever, some people may experience cloudy vision because the membrane holding\\nthe synthetic lens can decline with age. Fortunately, a quick and safe in-\\noffice laser procedure can address this issue. Are you experiencing changes in\\nyour vision? Let Lumen Optometric assess your vision and eye health.

However, beware of what is and isn’t true about your eyes. Doing your\\nresearch and learning the truth can help you better take care of your eyes. A\\nlocal scleral optometrist debunks some of the most common myths about vision\\nand eye health. Reading in the Dark Is Harmful to Your Eyes Your mom has\\nprobably told you that you shouldn’t read in the dark because it will damage\\nyour eyes. Reading in low lighting conditions may lead to eye fatigue or a\\nheadache but it can’t cause permanent damage. Constantly Wearing Your Glasses\\nWill Weaken Your Eyes Wearing glasses will not make your eyes weak. While some\\neye conditions will get worse over the years, it doesn’t have anything to do\\nwith glasses. Moreover, your glasses are there to help you see better and\\ncorrect your vision. Using Digital Devices a Lot Is Bad for Your Eyes Using\\nyour phone, computer, and other digital devices for an extended period can\\nresult in eye fatigue. However, it will not result in nearsightedness,\\nfarsightedness, or astigmatism. To avoid eye strain, make sure you’re taking\\nbreaks in between using your devices. It would also help to wear the right\\neyewear. At Lumen Optometric, we offer neurolens treatment and other vision\\ncorrection options. Eating Carrots Will Make Your Vision Better Another common\\nmyth about your vision is that it will improve by eating carrots. This\\nvegetable is rich in vitamin A, which is necessary for you to maintain good\\neyesight. However, your body only needs a tiny amount of vitamin A for vision\\nand you can get it from other sources like fish, dairy, darky leafy greens,\\nand bright-colored vegetables.

In this blog post, we’ll explore this topic\\nand examine the existing evidence surrounding the relationship between sleep\\npatterns and vision in children and teenagers. The Link Between Sleep Habits\\nand Vision: Currently, there’s a lack of direct clinical trial evidence\\nconfirming the precise impact of sleep habits on vision. However, intriguing\\nfindings from animal models provide suggestive insights into this connection.\\nDisrupting the overall circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep-wake cycles,\\nmay potentially influence refractive development in the eye. Understanding the\\nRole of Circadian Rhythm: The eye is a complex organ, with various components\\noperating on their own biological rhythms. These include the cornea, choroid,\\nintraocular pressure, and lens. Disrupting these biological rhythms can affect\\nthe rate of eye growth, potentially impacting vision development over time.\\nIndirect Evidence and Myopia Risk: While direct clinical evidence is lacking,\\nindirect evidence from animal models suggests that staying up late and waking\\nup late—common habits among children and teenagers—may increase the risk of\\nmyopia. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent vision condition\\ncharacterized by difficulty seeing distant objects clearly. Considerations and\\nCaution: It’s essential to interpret these findings with caution and recognize\\nthe limitations of extrapolating animal model data to human populations. While\\nsuggestive, these findings do not provide definitive answers regarding the\\nimpact of sleep habits on vision in children and teenagers. Conclusion: In\\nconclusion, the relationship between sleep habits and vision in children and\\nteenagers remains an area of ongoing research and investigation. While animal\\nmodel studies suggest a potential link between disrupted circadian rhythms and\\nvision development, direct clinical evidence is needed to confirm these\\nfindings in human populations. Fostering healthy sleep habits for children is\\nessential for overall well-being, including their vision health. Encouraging\\nconsistent sleep schedules and adequate rest may contribute to optimal vision\\ndevelopment. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed to staying informed about the\\nlatest research and providing comprehensive care to support your child’s\\nmyopia treatment journey.

May 8, 2020 by Lumen Optometric It’s\\nnot uncommon to feel irritation or scratchiness in our eyes. This sensation is\\ntypically associated with dry eye and seasonal allergies, even though the\\ndifference between the two is often muddled. This may be due to the fact that\\nboth conditions can affect our eyes simultaneously, the symptoms overlapping.\\nFortunately, with a specific dry eye treatment and simple lifestyle tweaks,\\nyour visual issues can still be corrected. What Is Dry Eye? Dry eye is a\\ncommon problem that is likely to occur after age 50. It is a condition\\nexperienced by people who don’t have enough quality tears to lubricate and\\nnourish their eyes. Dry eye can occur due to several causes, including tears\\nnot being made properly and tears evaporating too fast. Other patients may\\nhave a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, where the glands in the\\neyelids become clogged, preventing the production of oil found in tears. More\\nthan 86% of all patients with dry eye have this condition. Another possible\\nreason for dry eye is ocular misalignment which can be corrected by neurolens\\ntreatment. Is It Seasonal Allergies? The symptoms of seasonal allergies can be\\nsimilar to dry eye, but the indicating sign is itchiness. When the eye is\\nexposed to an allergen like pollen and pet dander, histamines are released,\\ncausing the eyes to itch or tear. If seasonal allergies are affecting your\\neye, taking antihistamine can be quite effective to fight the inflammation.\\nThere are other steps you can take to ease your allergy symptoms. Close the\\nwindows and doors in your eyes when the pollen count is high outdoors. Use\\nclean mattress covers on your bed to prevent dust mites. Use a dehumidifier in\\nyour home when humidity levels are high to prevent the growth of mold and\\nmildew. Wear sunglasses when you’re outside to help keep pollen out of your\\neyes. When experiencing a severe dry eye, it’s safer not to assume the cause\\nand instead seek out professional advice from an eye doctor or a scleral\\noptometrist. Here at Lumen Optometric, we can expertly determine the cause of\\nyour symptoms and prescribe the appropriate treatment plan.

Read on to discover how sports eyewear\\ncan help improve your performance and where you can find personalized eyewear\\nsolutions just right for your sport of choice. Benefits of Wearing Sports\\nEyewear The right sports eyewear can be a game-changer in the following ways:\\nEnhancing Visual Performance Stepping up your game begins with seeing the game\\nbetter. Sports eyewear, whether it’s a simple pair of sports glasses or\\ncustomized contact lenses, can significantly enhance your ability to focus and\\nsee clearly. For every basketball player aiming for the hoop or a tennis\\nplayer watching out for the incoming serve, better vision equals better\\nperformance. Protective Features Beyond improving your vision, another crucial\\nreason to wear sports eyewear is to protect your eyes from potential injuries.\\nHigh-speed sports like hockey or racquetball create numerous opportunities for\\nerrant balls or pucks to cause serious harm to your eyes. Protective sports\\neyewear can guard against these risks and provide peace of mind as you play.\\nImportance of Correct Prescription and Fit Just like the right cleats or a\\ncozy pair of gloves, having the proper prescription and fit for sports eyewear\\nis essential. An incorrect prescription can defeat the purpose of wearing\\neyewear and hinder your game performance. Similarly, eyewear that doesn’t fit\\nsecurely can become a distraction or slip off at an inconvenient time. It’s\\ncrucial to consult an eye exam doctor to ensure your prescription is up-to-\\ndate and your eyewear fits well. Different Types of Sports Eyewear Depending\\non the sport, there are many types of eyewear to choose from. Sports Glasses\\nThese are excellent for those who require a prescription for their vision but\\nalso need the structural robustness to withstand physical sports. Sports\\nglasses typically have reinforced frames and lenses to maintain their shape\\nand performance. Prescription Sports Goggles For those involved in high-impact\\nsports, prescription sports goggles offer a higher level of protection. They\\nfit snugly to your face to prevent any foreign objects or harsh sunlight from\\nimpairing your vision. Sports Sunglasses For those sunny outdoor games, sports\\nsunglasses not only improve your vision but also shield your eyes from harmful\\nUV rays, helping to prevent long-term eye damage. Lumen Optometric: Enhancing\\nYour Sports Performance At Lumen Optometric, we aim to help you find the ideal\\neyewear for your sporting needs. We offer comprehensive eye exams to ascertain\\nyour precise prescription and orthokeratology services for those looking for a\\nlens-free solution.

These are often serious and need medical attention. Neurolens\\ntreatment specialist Lumen Optometric has shared below what you need to do if\\nyou have the following injuries: Embedded Foreign Object If an object, such as\\na piece of glass or metal, penetrates or enters the globe of the eye and/or is\\nsticking out, you’ll need to call for emergency medical help or bring the\\nchild to the emergency room as soon as possible. You should also cover the\\naffected eye with a small cup taped in place so that it keeps all pressure off\\nthe eye. Make sure to keep your child (and yourself) as calm and comfortable\\nas possible until help arrives. Irritations If your child has dirt, sand, or\\nother foreign bodies on their eye surface, our resident scleral optometrist\\nrecommends that you wash your hands thoroughly and examine the eye. Don’t\\ntouch, rub, or press the eye itself except by flushing, as other methods can\\neasily scratch the surface, especially the cornea. Next, tilt your child’s\\nhead over a basin or sink with the affected eye down and gently pull down the\\nlower lid. Encourage your child to open the eyes as wide as possible, but if\\nit’s an infant or small child, it’s helpful to have a second person hold the\\nchild’s eyes open while you flush. Afterward, gently pour a steady stream of\\nlukewarm water from a pitcher or faucet over the eye, and flush for up to 15\\nminutes. Check the eye every 5 minutes to see if the foreign body has been\\nflushed out. When you need to have your eyes checked by a trusted dry eye\\ntreatment expert, don’t hesitate to visit Lumen Optometric.

Know When to Remove Your Lenses Most scleral lens wearers can\\ncomfortably wear their lenses for 12 to 14 hours. However, experts recommend\\ntaking the lenses off one hour before you go to sleep. Moreover, if your\\nlenses fog throughout the day and you feel like you need to remove them\\nalready, don’t hesitate to do so. Typically, fogging occurs as a result of\\npoor alignment of the lens with the eye. In this kind of situation, the lens\\nrocks and causes mucus to form. The mucus then becomes trapped in the saline\\nlayer of the lens, which causes the blurry vision. That said, it is important\\nto get the best fit of scleral lenses for your eyes in order to minimize\\nfilming or fogging. Rub Lenses After Removing Make sure to rub your lenses\\nafter removing them so as to remove surface debris. You can ask your scleral\\noptometrist to demonstrate the proper way of doing this so that you can avoid\\ndamaging the lenses. Generally, it is ideal to rub each lens for two to 20\\nseconds, depending on your care solution. Use a Filling Solution With No\\nPreservatives A preservative-free filling solution is the best way to keep\\nyour eye’s health at an optimum level. Regular eye drops can cause damage to\\nyour eyes and your lenses because these often contain preservatives, so you\\nshould avoid using them at all times. Lumen Optometric offers a range of eye\\ncare services. Our expertise includes neurolens treatment, scleral lenses,\\nmyopia management, and more.

Do you experience these two problems at the same time as\\nwell? Is there a way to avoid or lessen their effects? Dry eye treatment\\nexperts from Lumen Optometric share some info! Dry Eye and Migraines Studies\\nhave been conducted on the theory of dry eye and migraines being involved with\\none another and worsening the effects of both. A study titled Tear Osmolarity\\nand Subjective Dry Eye Symptoms in Migraine Sufferers was made in 2017 and was\\nmade to explore this correlation. Tear osmolarity refers to the amount of salt\\ncontent in an individual’s tears. Tear osmolarity is a regular test for dry\\neyes, as the higher the salt content of a person’s tears, the more prone they\\nare to dry eye. In the above-mentioned study, they had 34 migraineurs in the\\nresearch group, and during the observation period, migraine attacks were\\ngenerally accompanied by dry eye. Additionally, the more frequent the migraine\\nattacks became, their tear osmolarity also increased. To summarize, the study\\nfocused on the link between migraines, dry eye, and tear osmolarity. And\\nduring the study, when migraines occurred, the effects of dry eye were also\\nobserved. And the more migraines with severe pain and discomfort the research\\nsubjects experienced, the saltier their tears became, resulting in them\\nbecoming more susceptible to dry eye. Dry Eye Treatment Contact lens users are\\nvery susceptible to the effects of dry eye, and these lenses need the right\\namount of lubrication to function comfortably on the surface of the eyes. If\\nyou’re someone who uses a contact lens and has been having bouts of dry eye,\\ncontacting your scleral optometrist or nearest eye clinic would be the best\\ncourse of action. If you’re getting dry eye that comes with migraine,\\nlessening the effects of both is possible by getting the proper dry eye\\nprescription and taking standard medications against migraines. Commonly,\\ntreatment for dry eye is done by the use of artificial tears, as dry eye\\nhappens when your eyes can’t get the right amount of lubrication they need.\\nWith eyes that lack the proper amount of lubrication, artificial tears are the\\noptimal way to address dry eye. They are available over-the-counter and come\\nin the form of liquid, gel, or ointment types. If your eyes are always tearing\\nup and lessening your tear reserves, getting assistance from an eye care\\nclinic and requesting tear duct plugs is a good way to prevent dry eye.\\nContact Us!

Even if your vision seems clear,\\ngetting routine eye exams is essential. Many people aren’t even aware of an\\neye problem until they see an eye specialist.

Keep Track\\nof Vision Changes You will never know if your vision has changed or if you\\nneed to start wearing prescription glasses until you see a specialist. Eye\\ndoctors will perform various tests to trace even the slightest changes in your\\nvision. Regardless of age, you should schedule regular eye exams. It will\\nensure you have the appropriate vision correction eyewear, allowing you to see\\nclearly and comfortably. Your eye doctor can also determine if you need dry\\neye treatment during your appointment.

Cataracts, macular degeneration and glaucoma\\nare some eye problems that don’t manifest apparent symptoms until in their\\nlater stages. Early detection and treatment are crucial in preserving vision\\nand delaying the progression of these eye conditions. Catch Signs of Other\\nHealth Issues Your eyes can say a lot about your overall health. It isn’t\\nuncommon for eye doctors to detect indications of other health issues while\\nassessing their patients’ eyes. If this is the case, they will encourage you\\nto get further assessments from a medical practitioner. Common conditions\\ncaught during comprehensive eye exams include diabetes, hypertension, high\\ncholesterol, multiple sclerosis and thyroid diseases. At Lumen Optometric, we\\nwill thoroughly assess your eyes to catch problems that can affect your\\nvision. Let us help you monitor your vision and eye health!

We believe in helping our patients by providing\\nthem with the information that they need to safeguard their vision and eye\\nhealth. We strongly suggest scheduling comprehensive eye exams every one to\\ntwo years and familiarizing yourself with some of the early signs of eye\\nconditions. In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen\\nOptometric discusses the eye symptoms that you shouldn’t ignore. Double Vision\\nIf you experience double vision when both of your eyes are open, then it might\\nmean that your eye muscles aren’t aligned properly. Possible causes for this\\ncondition can include serious neurological problems, so you need to take this\\nsymptom seriously. If you only have double vision in one eye, then you might\\nhave an issue related to your retina or a cataract. We recommend scheduling an\\nappointment with us immediately so we can figure out the cause of this\\nproblem. Itching and Burning Sensation If you feel an itching and burning\\nsensation in your eyes then you might have a condition called blepharitis.\\nThis condition is caused by bacteria or microscopic mites that live on your\\neyelids. Other possibilities include a painful inflammation of the eyelid’s\\noil gland, infections, styes, or overexposure to UV rays. As an expert in\\ncontact lenses and eye exams, we can figure out the cause of this symptom.\\nSudden Increase in Floaters If you experience a sudden increase in the number\\nof floaters, then you need to see your eye doctor as soon as possible. This\\ncan indicate that the retina and blood vessels have been torn. If you also see\\nflashes of light, then this can be a sign of retinal detachment. Fortunately,\\neye doctors have a lot of options when it comes to treating this condition.\\nThe treatment depends on the location and size of the tear. If you need to\\nschedule an eye exam, then give Lumen Optometric a call. We offer\\ncomprehensive eye exams, orthokeratology and other vision care services.

For people with poor vision, eyeglasses are their windows to a clearer\\nand more vivid world, so making sure that their glasses are well-maintained\\nand properly cared for is a high priority. If you wear glasses, there are a\\nfew things that you should keep in mind to keep your eyeglasses in an optimal\\ncondition, and corneal reshaping experts from Lumen Optometric are here to\\nhelp! Wiping Don’t use wet wipes, napkins, or paper towels. These cleaning\\nmaterials are made of wood pulp and have roughly textured surfaces that can\\nscratch the lenses of your eyeglasses and can affect the coating on them too.\\nAs much as you need to, avoid using the hem or the edge of your clothes in\\ncleaning them as well. Unless your shirt is made purely with cotton, wiping\\nyour lenses with it can cause more trouble in the long run. Microfiber cloth\\nis the best material to use when wiping grime, dirt, and other substances off\\nthe lenses, as they are designed to do so with great care and efficiency.\\nHandle With Care When performing maintenance and cleaning on your specs,\\nremember to properly handle them. Take them off by holding both sides, and\\ndon’t pull them off by using one hand, as this is one of the most common\\ncauses of joint snapping for older eyeglasses. Avoid holding them by one of\\ntheir frame arms, as it can bend your eyeglasses at an awkward angle and can\\ncause fitting issues. If you’re gonna wipe the lenses, hold your eyeglasses by\\nthe bridge (the part that goes over your nose) and gently wipe the lenses in a\\ncircular motion. If taking care of eyeglasses feels like a hassle for you, you\\ncan try having contact lenses prescribed to you instead. Cleaning Solutions\\nUsing strong chemical cleaning solutions on the surface of your lenses is not\\na good idea, as most household cleaning fluids contain ammonia or some other\\nform of strong acids. These can destroy and erode the protective coating over\\nthe lenses, and leave minuscule amounts of the chemical on the surface of the\\nlenses that are facing inwards toward your eyes, which can cause irritation\\nand discomfort, or worse, dry eye.

Let’s explore the pros and cons of\\nglasses and contacts to help you make the best choice for your eyes and\\nlifestyle. Advantages of Contact Lenses Contact lenses offer a clear, natural\\nfield of view without any obstructions or distortions at the edge of your\\nvision. For those concerned with their appearance, contact lenses won’t block\\nyour face or alter your appearance, although some can change your eye color.\\nFor athletes and those leading an active lifestyle, contact lenses are the way\\nto go as these are less likely to be dislodged. The range of options available\\nis vast. You can choose daily disposables, weeklies or even monthlies based on\\nyour comfort level and lifestyle. Before making your decision, schedule a\\ncomprehensive eye exam to identify any specific concerns or determine whether\\nyou need to work with a scleral optometrist. Disadvantages of Contact Lenses\\nOn the flip side, contact lenses require maintenance. They need to be properly\\ncleaned and stored, which can be time-consuming. Some people may even feel\\ndiscomfort or irritation, especially if they have sensitive eyes. Dry eyes can\\nbe a common issue for people considering the switch. Dry eye treatment is\\navailable and can greatly ease the transition to contact lenses. You may also\\nwant to consider a trial period with contacts before you fully commit to the\\nswitch. The risk of eye infections also increases as contacts are directly\\nworn on the eye. On top of that, the recurring expenses for contact lenses and\\ncare products can add up, making them an expensive choice in the long run.\\nMake the Switch With Lumen Optometric At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to\\ndiscuss your options—whether you are switching to contact lenses from\\neyeglasses or need a Neurolens treatment. Call us at (626) 921-0199 or visit\\nour contact page to schedule an appointment.

Eyesight only refers to the ability a person has to see clearly\\nwithout any corrective lenses, which varies from person to person and can\\nchange over time. Meanwhile, vision is the ability to process what a person\\nsees and it can be improved with practice. Lumen Optometric, the eye center to\\ntrust for neurolens treatment, gives more insight on how they differ from each\\nother. Eyesight This is something that takes place in the eye. Light enters\\nthrough the front of the eye and then an image is created on the retina. If\\nthe eye is not perfectly shaped, the image may not focus perfectly on the\\nretina. When this happens, some may wear glasses or contact lenses in order to\\nimprove eyesight or clarity of what they see, or in some cases, wear special\\nlenses prescribed by their trusted scleral optometrist. The image of what they\\nsee in their eyesight is then transferred to the brain where vision takes\\nplace. Vision This takes place in the brain. The brain receives a clear image\\nand then the vision is the process of understanding and analyzing the image.\\nThe brain automatically filters the information and determines what\\ninformation is important and ignores the rest of the information. Vision can\\nbe both consciously or subconsciously processed and is affected not only by\\ninformation coming in but also by what we expect to see due to prior\\nknowledge. How Do They Work Together? Let’s say a child is presented with a\\npicture of a cow. Eyesight is used to see the image clearly, while vision\\nprocesses what they see and recognizes what the image is. When an eye doctor\\ntells the child that they have 20/20 vision, they’re really saying that their\\neyesight is fine. While this means the child can see clearly, vision still\\nrefers to recognizing the image and whether both their eyes work together to\\nprocess what they see. So, if the child has never seen a cow before, their\\nvision won’t be able to recognize what the image is. When you need a trusted\\nspecialist on dry eye treatment, Lumen Optometric is the name you can count\\non. Call us today at (626) 921-0199, or you can fill out our convenient online\\nform.

Having myopia as a child significantly increases the risk of\\ndeveloping sight-threatening conditions like macular degeneration,, glaucoma,\\nand retinal detachment later in life. Even children with low levels of myopia\\nhave a greater risk of glaucoma and retinal detachment compared to their non-\\nmyopic counterparts. The good news is that slowing down the progression of\\nmyopia can drastically lower the risks of developing eye disease later in\\nlife. Innovative products like MiSight 1-day contact lenses help ensure a\\nhealthier future for myopic children. As part of the Treehouse Eyes network,\\nwe are proud to be one of the first practices in the country to be certified\\nto fit MiSight 1-day contact lenses for myopia treatment, and be part of the\\nBrilliant Futures Myopia Management Program. CooperVision, which manufactures\\nMiSight 1-day lenses, calls Brilliant Futures “the new standard of care” for\\nchildren with myopia. “It provides inclusive practice, child and parent\\nsupport to create the optimal environment for compliance, satisfaction,\\nclinical outcomes and long-term loyalty, all via a comprehensive management\\nprogram featuring MiSight 1-day daily disposable contact lenses.” What are\\nMiSight 1-Day Contact Lenses? MiSight 1-day contact lenses are soft lenses\\nthat are worn daily and disposed of after each use. A fresh pair of contacts\\nare placed into the eyes every morning to provide the child with crisp and\\nclear vision while also slowing the eye’s elongation — the source of\\nprogressive myopia. These contacts are safe and easy for children to use since\\nthey require almost no maintenance. Four different clinical trials were\\nconducted to study the safety and effectiveness of MiSight lenses over a\\n3-year span; 135 children between the ages of 8-12 participated in the trials.\\nThose who wore MiSight contacts experienced considerably less myopia\\nprogression than those who wore conventional soft contact lenses. MiSight\\n1-Day Contact Lenses: A Popular Choice CooperVision recently partnered with\\nSarah Michelle Gellar, a well-known American actress, entrepreneur and\\nproducer, to help spread awareness about the importance of myopia management\\nand annual eye exams for myopic children. The need for myopia management hit\\nhome for Gellar, who is myopic herself and has a child with myopia. “My\\nhusband and I are both nearsighted and our myopia has continued to worsen over\\ntime. We want our kids to have a chance for better vision and lower their risk\\nfor future eye health issues” explains Gellar. While regular eyeglasses or\\ncontacts help children see a whiteboard or tennis ball, “MiSight 1- day lenses\\noffer children the benefits of clear vision while slowing myopia progression\\nduring their growing years. That is why I am thrilled to be partnering with\\nCooperVision on this campaign,” Gellar says. Moreover, many parents are\\npleased to learn that MiSight 1-day contact lenses are FDA approved. In\\nNovember 2019, the lenses received FDA approval to slow myopia progression in\\nchildren who are 8-12 years old at the time of their first fitting — making\\nMiSight 1-day contact lenses the only FDA approved soft contact lenses for\\nmyopia management! We Are Proud to Be Part of the Myopia Management Movement\\nIn addition to MiSight, our highly trained and experienced doctors can offer\\nother treatment options to manage childhood myopia, including specialized\\novernight-wear contact lenses and prescription eye drops. Contact us today to\\nmake an appointment for a myopia consultation for your child. We’ll evaluate\\nyour child’s eyes and vision and recommend a personalized treatment plan that\\nwill work best for your child and your family.

GMAC, of which Treehouse Eyes is a member,\\ninvited junior racers to the go-kart track for an unexpected eye exam before\\nheading out for some fun! A recent survey of parents by the Global Myopia\\nAwareness Coalition found \\u200b\\u200b”… half of the parents reported their children\\nspent more than four hours using electronic devices each day during the\\npandemic, compared to 18% of parents reporting the same behavior prior to the\\npandemic.” Most children don’t notice anything is wrong with their vision\\nuntil it starts to really impact their activities. Eye screenings done by a\\npediatrician are important, but they don’t always pick up on myopia,\\nespecially at lower levels. This is why GMAC decided it was more important\\nthan ever to raise awareness of myopia and the treatments available. Watch the\\n“Little Kid License” video now: In the same survey mentioned above, GMAC\\ndiscovered that “… more than 70% of parents believe their pediatrician will\\nflag any issues related to their children’s eyesight and, almost the same\\namount trust that their child would say something if they had vision issues.”\\nUnfortunately, this is often not the case. But, why is this such an important\\nproblem to face? Myopia develops rapidly as children grow. Remember, your\\nchild’s eye grows like any other part of their body as they age. Since\\nchildren are prone to growth spurts, naturally their eyes are as well. Myopia\\noccurs when a child’s eyes grow too fast, leading to blurry distance vision\\nand greater risk for eye diseases later in life. We know the start of the\\nschool year is insanely busy with back-to-school activities along with the\\neveryday obligations of work and life, but it’s now more important than ever\\nto find a provider that understands how to diagnose and treat your child’s\\nmyopia. Give your child the tools they need to succeed! To schedule your\\nchild’s back-to-school eye exam, visit book an appointment or to see a list of\\nall providers near you visit Treehouse Eyes today.

October is Halloween Eye\\nSafety Month and below we have some helpful tips on how to make sure your\\nchild’s Halloween costume doesn’t leave complications for your kids vision.\\n1\\\\. Get an eye exam. Don’t be haunted by an eye infection. If you’d like to\\nobtain decorative lenses for a Halloween costume, make sure to get an eye exam\\nso your eye doctor can give the proper prescription and provide you with\\ninformation about the proper contact lens cleaning and care. 2\\\\. Get A\\nPrescription For Decorative Lenses The CDC and the American Academy of\\nOphthalmology recommend not to purchase decorative contact lenses from costume\\nshops, online stores, beauty salons, drug stores, flea markets, or anywhere\\nthat doesn’t require a prescription. Make sure to see a doctor to get lenses\\nproperly fitted, so your child isn’t at risk for vision problems such as eye\\ninfections and eye sores which can lead to permanent vision loss. Learn more\\nabout decorative lenses here. 3\\\\. Be Mindful Of Makeup Use Halloween makeup\\ncan be a fun way to enhance any costume, but it’s essential to not share\\nmakeup for the risk of eye infection. Practice good hygiene by taking off all\\nmakeup before bed and avoid using old, expired makeup. For eyelash extensions,\\nit’s important to test for lash glue allergies and practice proper hygiene\\nduring application. See more about Halloween makeup safety. 4\\\\. Have Fun! Now\\nthat you’ve gotten your eye exam and your costume is complete, it’s time to go\\nout and have fun. Enjoy your night knowing your child’s eyes will look ‘cool’\\nand won’t cause any long-lasting effects after the fun is over. Spread\\nAwareness and Enjoy Spooky Season! Make Halloween as memorable as possible for\\nyour child and spread the word to other parents about the importance of\\nchildren’s eye health.

In today’s post, your local eye exam doctor at Lumen Optometric shares\\na look at high-index lenses. Regular Lenses People suffering from refractive\\nerrors — nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism — choose to wear\\neyeglasses to correct their vision: it’s easier to wear than contact lenses,\\nnot as invasive or costly as an eye operation, and it can be fashionable.\\nEyeglasses correct refractive errors by compensating for factors such as eye\\nlength and the curvature of the cornea and lens, providing good vision.\\nSometimes a person’s vision may require strong eyeglass prescriptions that\\nrequire thicker lenses. Most eyeglass wearers are nearsighted, which requires\\nlenses that are thinner at the center than at the edges. The stronger the\\nprescription, the thicker the edges will be, which can result in heavy lenses.\\nThis can limit one’s options in terms of eyewear selection, as one may need to\\nstick to thicker frames to hold their lenses. Wearing contact lenses might not\\nbe an option for some people. High-Index Lenses Many of today’s eye care\\ncenters offer high-index lenses as an option. They provide the same level of\\nrefractive correction as regular lenses but are much thinner. High-index\\nlenses offer the following benefits: Thinner and lighter — High-index lenses\\nhave thinner edges even at high power, which opens up a wider selection of\\nframe styles for you. Lighter lenses also make it easy to wear, even for\\nprolonged periods. Aesthetically pleasing — One reason why some people dislike\\nwearing glasses is that high-power lenses tend to look like the bottom of a\\nsoda bottle, colloquially called “Coke bottle glasses,” which makes the eyes\\nlook smaller (for nearsighted prescriptions) or larger (for farsighted\\nprescriptions). High-index lenses are “aspheric,” — that is, less rounded —\\nthan regular lenses, which means even high-power lenses won’t distort your\\nfacial features.

January 22, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Your child’s\\nacademic performance highly depends on their sight. 80% of learning occurs\\nthrough vision, meaning eye problems can hinder your little one’s ability to\\ndo well in school. Moreover, many young kids aren’t aware they have issues\\nwith their vision or don’t complain of symptoms. That’s why regular\\nappointments with your local eye doctor matter. A local scleral optometrist\\nshares how poor vision can affect children’s learning. Difficulty Focusing\\nMyopia or nearsightedness is a common refractive error in children.\\nIndividuals with this eye condition can find it difficult to see distant\\nobjects. If your child is nearsighted, they might struggle to see the text on\\nthe board, which can cause them to lose focus. Their grades could suffer when\\nthey can’t concentrate on and understand their teacher’s instructions. If\\nyou’ve noticed that your child keeps squinting or holding reading materials\\ntoo closely to their face, schedule a visit with your eye doctor immediately.\\nOnly eye specialists can confirm if they are nearsighted and require\\nprescription glasses. At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to assist with your\\nfamily’s eye care needs. Aside from contact lenses and glasses, we offer dry\\neye treatment. Poor Reading Comprehension Vision issues can impact a child’s\\nreading comprehension skills. The eyes must work harmoniously to move across\\nthe page, recognize letters and understand the text. It isn’t uncommon for\\nchildren with vision-related learning problems to get confused with similar-\\nlooking letters, shapes and words because they can’t see the figures properly.\\nCompromised Hand-Eye Coordination Several studies have shown that exercise\\nduring school days can improve academic performance. If your little one\\ndoesn’t like playing outside with other kids or tends to shy away from\\nactivities that require distant vision, there’s a chance that they have\\nproblems with their sight. Your child won’t be able to enjoy the benefits of\\nphysical activity on their cognitive and motor skills if they don’t exercise\\nduring the day. At Lumen Optometric, we are here to help you reach your\\nchild’s fullest potential by providing reliable eye care services. Our team\\nspecializes in myopia management.

They can give you a more natural look than eyeglasses and are\\ngenerally safe to wear as long as you care for them properly. Many first-time\\nwearers tend to find it challenging to put in and remove their contacts. Put\\nin and take out your contacts easily using these helpful tips. How to Put in\\nYour Contacts Before handling your contacts, wash and dry your hands. Failing\\nto do so heightens the risk of eye infections and corneal ulcers from bacteria\\nexposure. Wash your hands using soap and warm water to ensure they are clean.\\nMoreover, avoid drying your hands with cloths or towels with lint. Go in front\\nof a mirror and stand on a flat surface. If there’s a sink below you, make\\nsure to plug the drain. To avoid confusion, make it a habit to put in the same\\nlens first. Place your contacts on the tip of your index or middle finger of\\nyour dominant hand. Inspect your lenses for scratches or damaged areas. If\\nyour lens forms a blow and the edges turn up, it means it’s in the correct\\nposition. Hold your upper lid open with your non-dominant hand while in front\\nof a mirror, and hold down your lower lid with the ring finger of your\\ndominant hand. It’s now time to put the lens in your eye, which you should do\\nwhile looking at the ceiling. To allow your lens to get in place, shut your\\neyes and roll them in a circular motion. Open your eyes and blink a couple of\\ntimes. Check your eyes in the mirror to see if the contacts are in the center\\nof your eyes. You’ll know your lenses are in the right position if you’re\\ncomfortable and seeing clearly. If not, take out the lenses and reinsert them.\\nRepeat the same procedure to your other eye once you’ve successfully put in\\nthe first lens. How to Take Them Out Again, make sure your hands are clean and\\ndry before touching your contacts. Remove any leftover contact lens solution\\nfrom the case and allow them to dry or dry with a clean cloth. Get in front of\\na mirror and gaze up. Pull your lower lid down using the middle finger of your\\ndominant hand. It helps to take off the same lens first to save yourself from\\nconfusion. Gently push the lens down to the white of your eye using the index\\nfinger of your dominant hand. Carefully pinch the lens with your index\\nfinger’s pads and thumb to take it off your eye.

However, too much of it can harm\\nvarious parts of your body, including your eyes. It can also affect your\\ncurrent and future eye health and vision. Continue reading to learn how\\nalcohol affects your eyes and vision from a local scleral optometrist. What\\nDoes Alcohol Do to Your Eyes? Moderate drinkers should expect the effects of\\nalcohol to wear off after a while, especially if they take proper care of\\ntheir bodies after drinking. After going out for drinks with your friends,\\nmake sure to drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated. It’s also important\\nto get sufficient rest and sleep. Meanwhile, heavy drinkers are at risk of\\nvision changes and even permanent eye damage. If you drink a lot in a single\\nday, you may experience dizziness and blurry vision. Making heavy drinking a\\nhabit is never a good idea because there is a close correlation between the\\nliver and the eyes. Every organ in your body is related, a reason why you\\nshould focus on your holistic health. It’s essential to get regular health\\nchecks and eye exams to keep track of your overall health. At Lumen\\nOptometric, we offer comprehensive eye exams and dry eye treatment. Excessive\\nDrinking and Your Vision Over time, drinking too much alcohol can cause brain\\ndamage. If your brain does not function properly, your vision may also suffer.\\nYou may have permanently blurred vision or double vision due to the weakening\\nof eye muscles. When this happens, your reaction time may also decrease.\\nExcessive drinking also compromises your peripheral vision and causes you to\\ndevelop tunnel vision. This condition can make driving difficult because your\\neyes can’t react well to headlights. Another thing that alcohol can damage is\\nyour ability to distinguish contrast in colors. Moreover, too much drinking\\nmay also result in optic neuropathy, migraines, and rapid eye movements. At\\nLumen Optometric, we’re more than happy to assist with your eye care needs. We\\noffer a wide range of services, including myopia management, orthokeratology,\\nand neurolens treatment. Call us at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our contact\\nform to schedule an appointment.

Women are particularly\\nvulnerable to cataracts due to hormonal changes. As of writing this article,\\nthe only treatment for cataracts is surgery. During cataract surgery, the\\ndoctor will remove the cloudy lens and replace them with an intraocular lens\\nor IOL. The exact cause of cataracts may be unknown, but many experts believe\\nthat oxidative stress can damage enzymes and proteins in the eye’s natural\\nlens. As such, the best way to reduce cataract risks is to eat a healthy diet\\nthat consists of antioxidant chemicals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole\\ngrains. Lumen Optometric, a top provider of corneal reshaping services,\\nrecommends adding these foods to your everyday menu. Fruits and Vegetables\\nAccording to research, you need five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables\\neach day for optimal eye health. Choose organic fruits and vegetables. When\\neating them as is or adding them as an ingredient for meals, leave the skins\\non, as they are full of vitamins A, C, and E as well as lutein and zeaxanthin.\\nFruits and vegetables offer the highest total antioxidant capacity, so be sure\\nto include them in your regular meals. Fish Another way to reduce the risk of\\ncataracts is by eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. This includes\\nseafood such as shrimp, tuna, salmon, and trout. If your eye exam doctor tells\\nyou that you are at risk for cataract development, you can slow the\\nprogression by eating fish at least twice each week. This way, you nourish\\nyour eyes and protect your vision. Whole Grains Having three servings of 100%\\nwhole grains daily is a great way to prevent cataracts. This may include\\namaranth, quinoa, sorghum, or millet. While these grains seem unfamiliar to\\nyou, research some recipes and add something new to your diet. In addition to\\nthat, you should also read food labels carefully. Avoid white bread and bakery\\nitems that may contain refined grains and sugars and select minimally\\nprocessed items. Nuts and Seeds Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects\\nmembranes of eye cells from radical damage. A few foods, including cooking\\noils, seeds and nuts, are exceptionally rich sources. Preserve the health of\\nyour eyes with the help of Lumen Optometric. In addition to comprehensive eye\\nexams, we also provide prescription glasses and contact lenses.

October 7, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Your eyeglasses or contact\\nlenses may seem like they’re still working perfectly, but they probably aren’t\\nif you’ve had them for a while. In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses\\nhow often you should have your eye prescription updated. How Often Should You\\nUpdate Your Eye Prescription? People have different eye care needs. Some need\\nto have their eye prescription changed annually, while others won’t need to\\nupdate theirs every three years. If you’ve been keeping up with routine\\nappointments with your eye doctor, you’d already have an idea of how often you\\nshould update your eye prescription. Some factors affect how often a person\\nshould see their eye exam doctor and have their prescription updated. For many\\npeople, age and genetics are two such factors: if you have a family member who\\nneeds to update their prescription regularly, chances are you’ll be needing\\nthe same. Lifestyle is also another factor. For example, if you have a job\\nthat requires constantly facing a screen, eye strain can affect your vision\\nover the long term. Signs That You Need to Update Your Eye Prescription\\nRegular visits to your eye doctor can help determine how often you should\\nupdate your prescription. The pandemic has made it difficult for people to see\\ntheir eye doctor, but if you haven’t had an eye exam even before the\\nquarantines began, then you should see one as soon as possible — even more so\\nif you’re experiencing one or more of the following: You’re having frequent\\nheadaches. Pain behind or around the eyes is a warning sign that your brain is\\ntrying to compensate for the change in your vision. While resting your eyes\\nand taking pain medication can provide temporary relief, updating your eye\\nprescription is a better long-term solution. You’re often squinting. Squinting\\ncan help focus your vision and bring clarity. However, you shouldn’t have to —\\nnot with an updated eye prescription. You’re having trouble reading signs from\\na distance. If your daily routine includes tasks that depend on clear vision\\nsuch as driving, then an outdated prescription may put you at risk.

They occur when\\nthe shape of your eye prevents light from focusing correctly on your retina,\\nor the light-sensitive tissue layer found in the back of your eye. More than\\nfive million Americans suffer from refractive errors, impacting their quality\\nof life. But the good news is that this vision problem can be corrected. The\\npremier optometrist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares a quick overview of\\ndifferent refractive error types and their treatment. 1\\\\. Myopia. Also called\\n‘nearsightedness’, this particular refractive error makes it hard for people\\nto see far-away objects. Myopia happens when the eye is too long in the back,\\nor when there’s a problem with the shape of the cornea (the clear front layer\\nof the eyes) or the lens (the inner part of the eye that helps with focusing).\\n2\\\\. Hyperopia. To those with hyperopia, or ‘farsightedness”, nearby objects\\nwill appear blurry. This refractive error happens when the eyeball grows too\\nshort from front to back, or when the cornea or lens has a different shape\\nthan normal. Unlike those who suffer from myopia, which may develop in\\npatients between the ages of 6 and 14, people with hyperopia are usually born\\nwith this vision problem. 3\\\\. Astigmatism. When a person has astigmatism,\\nthey’ll have trouble seeing both far-away and nearby objects clearly. This is\\ncaused by a differently-shaped cornea or lens, which makes light bend\\ndifferently as it enters the eye. 4\\\\. Presbyopia. This type of refractive\\nerror affects middle-aged and older adults. Presbyopia is an age-related\\nvision problem that makes it hard for people to see things up close because\\nthe eye lenses have become harder and less flexible, preventing light from\\nfocusing properly on the retina. How Refractive Errors are Treated Before a\\nrefractive error can be corrected, it has to be diagnosed accurately during a\\ncomprehensive eye exam performed by a trusted eye care professional like Lumen\\nOptometric. Once the vision problem is diagnosed, it may be corrected using\\nprescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Myopia and hyperopia may also be\\nfixed without the benefit of eyeglasses or contacts through orthokeratology.\\nThis safe, FDA-approved and non-surgical treatment involves the use of custom\\nlenses that gently reshape the eyes as you sleep. Ask us more about this\\nparticular solution and determine whether this will be a viable option for\\nyou.

Whether you have a normal eye condition or you\\nhave existing eye conditions or a risk for certain eye conditions, the\\nfollowing tips from Neurolens treatment specialist Lumen Optometric will\\nsurely help give you peace of mind whenever you need to drive in the evening:\\nNight Driving Glasses If you’re having difficulty driving at night, you can\\nask your eye care specialist to prescribe special night driving glasses that\\ncan help you see better on the road. This type of glasses usually has a yellow\\ntint and anti-reflective coating. Also, lenses made with wavefront diagnostic\\ntechnology can reduce glare, halos, starbursts and other aberrations that can\\ndistract your vision. Regular Eye Checkup Make sure to have your eyes checked\\nby a specialist at least once every two years. If you have a significant eye\\ncondition or you have trouble with your eyes or vision, you may have to visit\\nyour eye doctor more frequently. Don’t hesitate to go for a checkup if you\\nexperience vision problems on the road at night. Your doctor may recommend\\nthat you take specialized testing, such as an evaluation of your visual field\\nor contrast sensitivity, to determine what’s wrong and what can be done to\\nimprove your condition. Also, don’t neglect any treatments prescribed to you.\\nIf you need dry eye treatment or treatment of an eye disease, make sure to\\nfollow your doctor’s instructions. Other Tips Below are other simple ways to\\nhelp ensure your safety while driving at night: Always keep your car windows\\nclear so that you can have a good view of the road.Do not drive if you are\\ntired or stressed. Driving requires focus. If you are already exhausted or\\ndealing with several distractions, it would be better to have someone else\\ndrive instead.Plan your trips, especially if you will be going on a long\\ndrive. As much as possible, stick to roads that you are familiar with and\\navoid dark, unlighted streets and risky spots.

It does\\nnot only strengthen and improve one’s physical abilities; it can also help\\nboost a person’s mental sharpness, emotional health, and social skills. But\\ndue to the nature of various kinds of sports, risks of injuries are always\\npresent. One example of this is the risk of eye injury. That said, it is\\nimportant to have the right gear and protective eyewear to keep your eyes\\nsafe. This is true for anyone, whether you are wearing glasses or contact\\nlenses or not. By wearing the right eye protection, you can save yourself from\\neye injuries such as corneal abrasion, detached retina, eye socket fracture,\\nand hyphema. Polycarbonate lenses are usually recommended for protective\\nsports eyewear because they are impact-resistant and shatterproof. They are\\nalso thinner and lighter than plastic and provide UV protection. Make sure\\nthat the polycarbonate lenses that you use meet or exceed the current sport-\\nspecific ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International\\nstandards. In this post, corneal reshaping expert Lumen Optometric shares tips\\non how you can protect your eyes when playing different sports. Baseball and\\nSoftball Use helmet-mounted faceguards that are approved by the National\\nOperating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE). Eye guards\\nlike goggles or spectacles are also recommended to minimize injury in case of\\na ball impact. Sports eye guards should be approved to ASTM F803-19 or the\\nmost current standard. Football Use a faceguard with a polycarbonate visor\\nshield. The shield will protect against objects that can potentially penetrate\\nopenings in the faceguard grid. Soccer Use sports eye guards that have ASTM\\nF803-19 approval. Basketball Use sports eye guards like goggles or spectacles\\nthat are approved to ASTM F803-19. Field Hockey Use sports eye guards that are\\napproved to ASTM F2713-18 or the most current standard.

A dry eye treatment specialist\\nshares some tips here. Preparing Is the First Step The first thing you should\\ndo to incorporate good eye care into your active lifestyle is to prepare ahead\\nof time. Get a travel pouch that fits your contacts, solution, gels, etc. Do\\nnot forget to pack eye drops that can alleviate itchiness during the hayfever\\nseason or dryness caused by heavy air conditioning. Consider Switching to\\nDisposable Contacts Sometimes, using weekly or even monthly contact lenses\\ndoes not make it easy to live your active lifestyle, especially if preparing\\ntravel kits is not your thing. If this is the case, bring up the idea of\\nswitching to contact lenses that you can dispose of daily with your optician.\\nHowever, this might not be a fitting option if you use scleral or other\\nspecialty lenses, says a scleral optometrist. Bring Your Sunglasses\\nOverexposure to ultraviolet rays can lead to a host of eye-related issues like\\ncataracts or corneal sunburn, so it is important to take the right precautions\\nto safeguard your vision from damage. Having a pair of sunglasses with you\\nduring travels is just as essential as having all your eye care accessories.\\nSure, contact lenses do provide protection against UVA and UVB, but unlike\\nsunglasses, they do not fully cover your eyes including the skin on your lids.\\nLumen Optometric is a premier eye care center specializing in contacts and\\neyeglasses, neurolens treatment, dry eye treatment, myopia control and more.\\nGive us a call at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our online form to schedule an\\nappointment.

In\\ntoday’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses what causes dry eye syndrome, and how\\nyou can manage it if it happens to you. What Is Dry Eye Syndrome? Dry eye\\nsyndrome is characterized by dryness around the eyes, which may be accompanied\\nby irritation, inflammation, or blurred vision. Anyone can experience these\\nsymptoms, however, discomfort is more pronounced for people who wear contact\\nlenses, as lack of moisture increases friction between the eyes and the\\nlenses. Dryness is usually caused by hormone changes, some autoimmune\\nconditions, or damage to the tear glands or the skin around the eyes. Advanced\\nage and certain types of allergies may also contribute to dry eye syndrome.\\nSome types of contact lenses, when worn for long periods, can also cause\\ndryness in the eyes. Managing Dry Eye Syndrome If you’re experiencing symptoms\\nof dry eye syndrome, do not take any medication or try how-tos that you may\\nfind online. Visit an eye exam doctor to determine its cause and plan\\ntreatment. One of the most common treatments for dry eye syndrome is taking\\nlubricating eye drops, which are often prescribed for dryness caused by\\ninefficient tear glands or very low humidity levels. If dryness is determined\\nto be caused by the medication that you’re taking, your eye doctor may require\\nchanges to your prescription. Choose the Right Contact Lenses If dryness\\noccurs when you wear your contact lenses, you don’t have to limit its usage or\\nswitch to eyeglasses if you’re not comfortable wearing one. The following are\\nother types of contact lenses that are more suitable for people suffering from\\ndry eye syndrome: Soft Contact Lenses — These contacts are made of hydrogel,\\nwhich contains water. Soft contact lenses are typically disposable, however,\\nsome manufacturers offer extended-wear options that are reusable for up to 30\\ndays. Silicone-Based Hydrogel Contact Lenses — These are functionally similar\\nto hydrogel-based contact lenses, but have better moisture retention. Gas-\\nPermeable Contact Lenses — These contacts are relatively more rigid, but they\\nlet oxygen reach the eye. Orthokeratology contact lenses are made from a\\nsimilar material. If you are experiencing symptoms of dry eye syndrome, call\\nLumen Optometric at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our contact form to schedule an\\nappointment.

However, by making a few\\nlifestyle changes, you can lower your risk for these conditions. This Healthy\\nAging Month, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, shares tips on\\ntaking care of your aging eyes. Eat a Balanced Diet Make sure to include in\\nyour diet foods rich in eye-friendly nutrients, such as Vitamin A (which helps\\nprotect the cornea, the surface of your eye) and Vitamin E (which prevent free\\nradicals from damaging proteins in your eyes). Should You Take Supplements?\\nSupplements can help prevent vitamin deficiencies, but they’re not a\\nsubstitute for a balanced diet. If you’re considering taking supplements,\\nconsult your eye doctor. Undergo Routine Eye Exams How often should you have\\nyour eyes checked? As a general rule, those aged 40 and above should see their\\neye doctor at least once a year. What many patients don’t realize is that they\\ndon’t usually notice that their vision has deteriorated unless the change is\\nabrupt or significant. That’s because your brain automatically adapts to any\\nchanges in your vision, sometimes tricking you into thinking there’s nothing\\nwrong with your vision even though it has already deteriorated. Through\\nroutine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect changes in your vision before\\nthey significantly affect your lifestyle and prescribe treatment. For\\ninstance, they might give you a higher prescription for your contact lenses.\\nWear Sunglasses Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays can damage your vision\\nand increase your risk for conditions such as cataracts or macular\\ndegeneration. To protect your eyes from UV damage, always wear sunglasses\\nwhile you’re outside. In particular, we recommend wearing sunglasses with a\\nshade of UV 400, which provide nearly 100% protection from UV rays.

That’s why parents are doing whatever they can to help\\ntheir children successfully transition to the next academic grade. Below, we\\nshare our top tips for parents, so they can ensure that their child’s vision\\nis a tool for success in school. 1\\\\. Balance Indoor and Outdoor Time Outdoor\\nplay offers numerous benefits, but many children aren’t getting enough of it.\\nMost children spend much of their time indoors, whether in a classroom, at\\nhome, or in after-school activities. Kids who regularly play outdoors have\\nimproved motor skills, feel more independent, and practice important social\\nskills. But the main benefit of “outdoor time” that eye doctors like to focus\\non is the lower incidence of myopia (where distant objects appear blurry).\\nNumerous studies published in journals like Ophthalmic Research and Review Of\\nOptometry have shown that children who spend 1.5-2.5 hours per day outdoors\\nduring the daytime have a reduced risk of becoming myopic or, if they have\\nmyopia, it progresses at a slower pace. Sending your kids outside to play\\nevery day will help their vision, overall health, and contribute to academic\\nsuccess. 2\\\\. Encourage Your Child To Take Frequent Breaks Once the new school\\nyear begins, students are often busy with daily homework, reading assignments,\\nand visually demanding recreational activities like video games. While all of\\nthese activities are important, they shouldn’t be done without periodic\\nbreathers. Eye strain is a real concern for the many students who spend hours\\nin front of a book or screen and can put a damper on their grades. Minimally,\\nhave your child follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes they should focus\\nfor 20 seconds on an object that’s at least 20 feet away. Even better,\\nencourage slightly longer breaks for a snack in the sun, or a quick walk\\naround the block to allow their eyes to focus on more distant objects. 3\\\\.\\nHave Their Eyes Examined by an Optometrist Whether or not your child wears\\nglasses, yearly eye exams will help ensure healthy visual development. It’s no\\nsurprise that children who don’t see well perform at a lower level than their\\npeers. In some cases, young children aren’t even aware that their vision has\\nchanged, or they may not be able to verbally express it. At our practice, our\\neye exams go far beyond the standard vision screenings offered in school. We\\nthoroughly check your child’s eye health and several visual skills, including\\nvisual acuity, focusing, tracking and teaming. If your child has myopia we\\nwill discuss if they are a candidate for myopia management. Myopia management\\ntreatments can slow or stop myopia in children and teens and doing so will\\nminimize their risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life. 4\\\\.\\nFilter Out Blue Light Now, more than ever, children’s eyes are focusing on\\nscreens of all shapes and sizes. While science hasn’t yet confirmed the\\ndamaging effects of blue light on a child’s eyes, one thing is certain: blue\\nlight exposure (especially in the evening) can lead to reduced sleep quality.\\nGood-quality sleep is crucial for cognitive and physical development, which is\\nwhy many parents purchase blue light glasses or utilize blue light filters\\nsuch as screens and software on devices. Blue light also contributes to\\ndigital eye strain, leading to symptoms like eye pain, headaches, blurred\\nvision and dry eyes. If your child uses a tablet, smartphone, or computer\\nbefore bedtime, speak with us about whether blue light glasses or lens\\ncoatings can help. Give your child the tools they need to succeed!

January 17, 2024 by Lumen\\nOptometric Around 80 million people around the world have glaucoma.\\nInterestingly, around half of the individuals with this eye problem aren’t\\neven aware of it. This condition often shows no symptoms in its initial\\nstages. It’s frequently called “sneak of the sight” because when not detected\\nand treated early, it can cause irreversible vision loss. Learn if glaucoma is\\npreventable from your local orthokeratology specialist. What Is Glaucoma?\\nGlaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve or the nerve\\nin the back of the eye. Its symptoms are usually not noticeable in its early\\nstages. People often only notice changes in their vision once the condition\\nhas progressed. The only way to confirm if you have glaucoma is to get a\\ncomprehensive eye exam. While it has no cure, early treatment can help\\npreserve your sight. Who Are at Risk? You can get glaucoma, regardless of your\\nethnicity and age. However, it’s more common in people over 60, African\\nAmericans over 60, and those with a family history of glaucoma. If you are at\\nhigh risk of this eye condition, you might need to see your eye exam doctor\\nevery one to two years. Is It Preventable? While glaucoma isn’t preventable,\\nit can be caught early through regular eye exams. Early detection and\\ntreatment go a long way in preventing significant or permanent vision loss.\\nEating nourishing meals has also been proven to be beneficial to eye health.\\nInclude leafy greens, colored fruits, berries and vegetables in your diet.\\nRegular exercise can lower eye pressure, which is helpful for people with\\nglaucoma. Even low-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is ideal for\\nglaucoma patients. Quitting smoking and wearing UV-blocking sunglasses are\\nother ways to protect your eyes from the effects of this vision-threatening\\neye condition. If you experience sudden vision changes, don’t wait long to\\nschedule an eye exam. At Lumen Optometric, we provide more than prescription\\neyeglasses and contact lenses.

July 14,\\n2020 by Lumen Optometric COVID-19 has changed the way people move and interact\\nin public spaces, influencing our personal hygiene and habits. For contact\\nlens wearers, the “new normal” has put a question on their use of contacts.\\nWhile contact lenses are generally a safe and effective form of vision\\ncorrection for many people, concerns have grown as to whether it’s OK to\\ncontinue using these lenses or not amid the pandemic. Since contact lenses are\\ninserted and removed using one’s fingers, wouldn’t this pose a higher risk of\\ncoronavirus infection? According to recent research, there is no sufficient\\nevidence suggesting that contact lens wearers have a higher risk of\\ncontracting COVID-19. Experts have also emphasized the importance of proper\\nhandwashing and good hygiene in order to prevent or reduce such risks. Lumen\\nOptometric, a trusted expert in eye care and dry eye treatment, shares more\\ntips below. Observe Proper Handwashing Before handling your contact lenses,\\nmake sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20\\nseconds. Afterwards, dry your hands with a clean towel or unused paper towels.\\nIf soap and water are not available, you can use a hand sanitizer containing\\nat least 60% of alcohol. Regularly Disinfect Contact Lenses Your scleral\\noptometrist will also likely advise you to regularly disinfect your contacts\\nif they are monthly or two-week lenses. Make sure to follow the cleaning\\ninstructions of the manufacturer or your eye doctor. If you have disposable\\nlenses, get rid of them properly every after use. Discontinue Wearing Contacts\\nand Switch to Glasses if Sick If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms or\\nyou have tested positive for COVID-19, it would be best to stop using your\\ncontacts and switch to glasses for the meantime. Take note, however, that\\nwearing glasses cannot protect you against COVID-19 or prevent transmissions\\nof the virus. Lumen Optometric is a local practice that offers top-notch eye\\ncare services. From eye exams to Neurolens treatment, we can ensure a\\npersonalized approach to your eye concerns. Call us at (626) 921-0199 or fill\\nout our contact form to request an appointment.

A myopic eye is one that grows too\\nlong front to back. We know this because we measure it using special equipment\\nthat calculates the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back\\n(retina). This distance is known as the axial length, and with advanced\\nequipment we can now measure this down to fractions of a millimeter. So myopia\\nis an abnormal elongation of the eye – if a normal eye is shaped like a\\nbasketball, then a myopic eye would more resemble a football. Portrait of boy\\nworking on team project in art class Once an eye is too long, there are\\ncurrently no known treatments or cures which can cause the axial length of the\\neye to reverse. Refractive surgery performed on adults, such as LASIK, does\\nnot “shrink” the eye, but rather reshapes the front surface of the cornea to\\nenable clear vision without corrective lenses. While the patient who has\\nsuccessful refractive surgery can now see clearly, they still have an\\nelongated eye, so still have the risks associated with the disease. The\\nDangers of Having Myopia There are different types of myopia as well. If a\\nchild develops myopia at a young age, we know that they are at higher risk to\\ndevelop high myopia and even pathological levels of myopia. High levels of\\nmyopia can lead to an increased risk for diseases of the eye such as retinal\\ndetachments, glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy. Unfortunately, those diseases\\ncan all lead to permanent vision loss. These life-altering diseases are\\nanother layer of danger besides the obvious need for optical correction in\\nglasses or contact lenses in order to see clearly. When you have pathological\\nor degenerative myopia, other signs can form on your eyes that your eye doctor\\nneeds to monitor over time. Lattice degeneration and lacquer cracks of the\\nretina all show signs that the retina is under duress because the eyeball has\\ngrown excessively long. Ask your doctor about these signs and other ones such\\nas a tilted optic nerve head disc and choroidal neovascularization that happen\\nexponentially higher in cases of extremely high levels of myopia. What are the\\nBest Ways to Treat Myopia? The best treatment is to first prevent myopia if\\npossible. More research is being conducted in this area, but as a general\\nrule, eye doctors are encouraging at least two hours of outdoor activity per\\nday. More outdoor activities under natural sunlight have been associated with\\na lower risk of developing myopia in the first place. If your children have to\\ndo intense studying or reading, it is recommended to do as much reading as\\npossible when the sun has set versus reading during the day. Regular checkups\\nwith your eye doctor to diagnose myopia as early as possible are also\\ncritical. By catching myopia at an early age, there can be many different\\ntypes of interventions to prevent myopia from worsening. Myopia typically\\nbegins in school-aged children and can worsen until the leveling out usually\\nin your mid-twenties. As far as the visual component is concerned, usually, a\\npair of glasses or contact lenses are sufficient. Once the eyes have stopped\\ngrowing, refractive surgery procedures can be employed as well. But keep in\\nmind that simply correcting your vision will not stop your eyes from getting\\nworse. The root cause of myopia, an eyeball that continues to grow excessively\\nlong during our youth, needs to be addressed. Special pharmaceutical agents\\nsuch as atropine have been shown to slow down the progression of myopia\\nconsiderably. Special contacts such as orthokeratology lenses worn at night\\nare effective as well. Even soft contact lenses and glasses designed with\\nspecial optics different from the traditional pair of glasses can be effective\\nto slow down the rate of myopic progression. Custom Orthokeratology or\\nOvernight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed\\ncontact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while\\nsleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names\\nfor orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping\\nsystem, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the\\ncurvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While\\ninitially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see\\nmore clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in\\nreducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused\\nin front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the\\noptical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact\\nlenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning and\\ndisinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper\\nhygiene ‘ortho-k’ is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating\\nchildren of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that\\ncan be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to\\ntreat children with amblyopia, sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used\\nto dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What\\nwe’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine\\ncan also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is\\nstill little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye\\nto reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the\\naxial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic\\nprogression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are\\nbeing designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight\\ncontact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia\\nby almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers\\nthroughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral\\nretina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact\\nlens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia\\nas well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating\\nEyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a\\nsimilar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is\\na particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact\\nlenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s\\nbodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of\\npower in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial\\nlength elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good\\nnews is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids—just like\\nyours—so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above\\nare four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been\\ndiagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with\\na contact lens while sleeping. Atropine involves an eye drop that can signal\\nthe eye to grow a little slower. Custom soft multifocal lenses are worn during\\nthe day. And even specially designed glasses are on the horizon to improve the\\nprogression of myopia. The Treehouse Eyes eye doctors use state-of-the-art\\nequipment to develop a personalized treatment plan for your child. Our non-\\ninvasive treatments include customized contact lenses and special prescription\\neye drops. Moreover, data shows that our patent-pending Treehouse Vision\\nSystem® treatment plan can decrease myopia progression by 78%. Give your child\\nthe tools they need to succeed!

January 1, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Routine visits to the\\neye doctor are necessary for maintaining the good health of your eyes. If you\\nfeel that there is something wrong with your vision or experiencing discomfort\\nin your eyes, you must consult a specialist immediately. You can either go to\\nan optometrist or an ophthalmologist if you have issues with your eyes. Read\\non to discover which eye exam doctor you should visit for your eye condition.\\nOptometrists VS Ophthalmologists An optometrist attends optometry school for\\nfour years and usually do a year of residency. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist\\ngoes to medical school for four years and does a four-year residency. Also, an\\nophthalmologist typically does a fellowship for one to two years. They can\\nchoose a specialty like glaucoma or pediatrics. Ophthalmologists will have an\\nMD or DO following their name while optometrists will have an OD after their\\nnames. Who Should You Go To? Both optometrists and ophthalmologists can\\nprescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses. The main difference between the two\\nprofessions is that an ophthalmologist performs surgeries while optometrists\\ndon’t. Ophthalmologists are surgeons who can also treat eye diseases. States\\nmay indicate which conditions optometrists can treat while ophthalmologists\\ncan treat all eye diseases. For eye exams and prescriptions, you can go to\\nboth eye doctors. Usually, an optometrist is the better option for those who\\nneed more contacts. On the other hand, those who need surgeries should consult\\nan ophthalmologist. It’s the same for serious conditions like macular\\ndegeneration and diabetic retinopathy. For your eye care needs, you can depend\\non Lumen Optometric.

Both organizations now recommend\\nchildren play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia, and support\\nproactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye\\ndisease risk associated with higher myopia later in life. What is Myopia?\\nMyopia causes blurry distance vision, which can be compensated for with\\nglasses or contact lenses to provide a child with clear vision. However,\\nmyopia is caused by an eye that is growing too long and, once started, myopia\\nusually gets worse in children as the eye continues to grow abnormally fast.\\nHigher myopia increases the lifetime risk of serious eye diseases such as\\nretinal diseases and glaucoma. How Bad is the Myopia epidemic? In late 2019,\\nthe American Academy of Ophthalmology created a Task Force on Myopia,\\nrecognizing the importance of this growing disease in children and the\\npotential lifelong impact myopia has on individuals and society. This task\\nforce identified priorities of educating other physicians, working with\\ngovernment agencies and health agencies, and educating parents and schools\\nabout this issue so that more proactive steps can be taken to help children.\\nTreehouse Eyes Co-founder, Matt Oerding, was recently interviewed about the\\nprevalence of myopia alongside Dr. William Reynolds of the American Optometric\\nAssociation and Dr. Emily McCourt, the chief of ophthalmology at Children’s\\nHospital Colorado.” Over the last two decades, there’s been an increase in\\nmyopia or nearsightedness worldwide, not just in the United States. And that\\ncorresponds with an increase in near devices, especially digital devices,”\\nReynolds said. Watch the full interview by clicking here. Myopia incidence is\\nrising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as\\nreading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global\\nphenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates\\nstate half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050. Can Myopia be\\nStopped? There is hope for parents, however, as several treatments are now\\navailable that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children.\\nThese treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription\\neye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s\\nvision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye\\ndoctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good\\ncandidate for treatment.

It’s estimated that the 700,000 workplace eye injuries that\\nhappen every year cost businesses roughly $934 million in combined\\nproductivity loss, health costs, fines, and employee compensation. That’s why\\nemployers are being encouraged to promote vision health among their employees\\nthis Workplace Eye Wellness Month. Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam\\ndoctor, shares eye care tips below: Remind Employees to Observe the 20-20-20\\nRule While using a computer, you should take short breaks to allow your eye\\nmuscles to rest. Every 20 minutes, employees should look at an object at least\\n20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Avoid Sitting Too Close to the Computer\\nScreen A common myth is that you can develop myopia (nearsightedness) or\\nhyperopia (farsightedness) if you sit too close to the screen. However, this\\nmyth has been debunked by the fact the two vision conditions have strong\\ngenetic links. While sitting close to the screen won’t cause nearsightedness\\nor farsightedness, it can increase digital eye strain. To prevent digital eye\\nstrain, the computer screen should be about 20 to 28 inches away from the\\nface. However, if employees keep moving closer to the screen to see better,\\nthey should see an eye specialist as soon as possible. That’s because they may\\nneed a higher prescription for their eyeglasses or contact lenses. Adjust the\\nComputer’s Display Settings Another way to reduce digital eye strain is to\\nadjust the computer’s display settings to make it easier for your eyes to\\nfollow the text and see images. Adjust the computer display’s brightness to\\nthe same level as your workplace’s brightness, enlarge the font size for\\neasier viewing, and reduce the color temperature to reduce the blue light—the\\nshort-wavelength visible light associated with increased eye strain—emitted.\\nAlternatively, employees can also wear computer glasses, which have yellow-\\ntinted lenses that block blue light. For more tips on reducing your exposure\\nto blue light, consult your local eye doctor.

Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, with the symptom\\nbeing blurry distance vision. Studies show that myopia rates in children are\\nincreasing as kids spend less time outdoors and more time involved in near\\nwork like digital device use. What many parents don’t know is that rapidly\\nprogressing myopia is more than just a hassle — it can harm your child’s eye\\nhealth. Children with progressive myopia are far more likely to develop\\npotentially sight-threatening eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, and\\nmacular degeneration later in life. Given the growing prevalence of myopia in\\nchildren the media are taking notice. There have been a number of articles\\nrecently about this issue in the New York Times, Women Fitness and more\\nlocally here in Bay Area Moms and Macaroni Kid. These articles have great tips\\nfor parents. We recommended kids get outside at least 2-3 hours a day and take\\nfrequent breaks from screen use to help their vision. We also offer new myopia\\ntreatments, including customized contact lenses and prescription eye drops,\\nthat we can use to treat myopia. Our practice specializes in providing these\\ntreatments and offers myopia consultations to customize a treatment plan for\\neach child. What Causes Myopia to Progress? Genetics play a large role in\\nmyopia development. Two nearsighted parents are more likely to have a myopic\\nchild than a couple with only one myopic parent, or no myopic parents at all.\\nNo one knows exactly why myopia progresses, but spending most of the day\\nindoors, focusing on near objects like screens and books, may be risk factors.\\nMore research is needed to determine whether the fact that children are\\nspending less time looking at faraway objects like a moving baseball or a\\nbasketball net might be contributing to the increase in myopia cases around\\nthe world. How Can I Prevent Myopia From Worsening? One of the best pieces of\\nadvice for parents of nearsighted children is to increase their child’s\\noutdoor playtime in the sun. In research studies, the progression of myopia\\nwas slower in children who spent a considerable amount of time in the sunshine\\nthan in children who did not. The World Health Organization advises that\\nchildren under 5 spend 1 hour or less per day in front of a screen, and no\\nscreen time is recommended for infants under 1. The Children’s Eye Foundation\\nrecommends outdoor play daily, and no screen time for children under 2. They\\nalso recommend no more than 1-2 hours per day for 2- to 5-year-olds, with\\nfrequent breaks. How Can a Myopia Management Eye Doctor Help? Myopia\\nmanagement eye doctors do more than prescribe corrective lenses. Although no\\nactual cure for myopia exists, there are methods that can help control its\\nprogression. Like most treatments, myopia treatment in children is most\\neffective when started early before a child is highly myopic. Our office\\npartners with Treehouse Eyes, the country’s leading provider of myopia\\ntreatments for children.

When\\nit comes to their vision, early detection of issues like nearsightedness\\n(myopia) is crucial for timely intervention and effective management. Myopia\\ncan impact a child’s academic performance, social interactions, and overall\\nquality of life if left unaddressed. In this article, we’ll highlight key\\nsigns that parents should watch for to identify if their child may be\\nexperiencing nearsightedness. Frequent Squinting: One of the most common signs\\nof nearsightedness in children is squinting. If you notice your child\\nsquinting often, especially when trying to see distant objects like road signs\\nor the whiteboard at school, it could indicate that they are having difficulty\\nfocusing on distant objects. Sitting Close to the TV or Holding Devices Close:\\nChildren with nearsightedness may instinctively sit closer to the television\\nor hold digital devices closer to their face to see more clearly. While\\noccasional closeness to screens is common, persistent behavior of this nature\\ncould be a red flag for myopia. Complaints of Headaches or Eye Strain:\\nChildren experiencing nearsightedness may complain of frequent headaches or\\neye strain, particularly after engaging in activities that require focusing on\\ndistant objects for extended periods, such as reading or watching movies in a\\ntheater. Difficulty Seeing the Whiteboard or Screen at School: If your child\\nconsistently has difficulty seeing the whiteboard or screen in the classroom,\\ndespite sitting in the front rows, it could indicate nearsightedness. They may\\nalso struggle to recognize faces or objects from a distance. Rubbing Eyes\\nFrequently: Excessive rubbing of the eyes can be a sign of eye fatigue or\\nstrain, which often accompanies nearsightedness. If you observe your child\\nrubbing their eyes frequently, especially after engaging in activities that\\nrequire visual concentration, it’s worth investigating further. Decline in\\nAcademic Performance: Unexplained declines in academic performance,\\nparticularly in subjects that require visual acuity like reading or math, may\\nbe attributed to undiagnosed nearsightedness. If your child’s grades suddenly\\ndrop or they express frustration with schoolwork, consider scheduling an eye\\nexam. Family History of Myopia: Genetics play a significant role in the\\ndevelopment of myopia. If one or both parents have myopia, there’s an\\nincreased likelihood that their children will also develop the condition. Keep\\nthis in mind and remain vigilant for signs of nearsightedness in your child,\\nespecially if there’s a family history. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your\\nChild’s Myopia: Recognizing the signs of nearsightedness in your child early\\non is essential for proactive intervention and effective management. If you\\nobserve any of the aforementioned signs or have concerns about your child’s\\nvision, don’t hesitate to schedule an myopia consultation with a Treehouse\\nEyes provider. Remember, addressing vision issues promptly can significantly\\nimpact your child’s overall well-being and success in various aspects of life.\\nLet’s work together to ensure our children’s vision remains clear for a bright\\nfuture ahead.

It can help you sleep\\nbetter by regulating your circadian rhythm. Studies show that daily and\\nhealthy exposure to sunlight can benefit the eyes of little ones. A local\\nscleral optometrist explains why safe sun exposure is great for your\\nchildren’s eyes. Sunlight and Your Kids’ Eyes Myopia or nearsightedness\\nhappens when the shape of the eye is too curved, keeping light from properly\\nfocusing on the retina. People who have it struggle to see distant objects.\\nWhen not detected and treated early, it can affect a child’s performance in\\nschool and at play. Have you noticed that your child blinks or squints a lot?\\nDo they often complain of headaches or that they can’t see the words on the\\nboard at school? If so, it’s best to schedule a visit with your local\\noptometrist. These are typical signs of nearsightedness in children. At Lumen\\nOptometric, we are here for your family’s vision correction and dry eye\\ntreatment needs. Moreover, research shows that children who spend time\\noutdoors are less likely to develop this vision condition. Experts believe\\nbright sunlight can aid in the retina’s production of dopamine, a hormone that\\ncan help regulate eye growth. Tips for Healthy Sun Exposure While natural\\nlight might benefit your child’s eyes, you should discourage them from looking\\ndirectly at the sun. Like adults, they need to wear UV-blocking sunglasses to\\nkeep their eyes safe from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. Even when\\nit’s cloudy outside, you and your child should apply sunscreen and wear\\nsunglasses. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat can also reduce the UV rays that reach\\nyour little one’s eyes. Then, limit their time outdoors during the sun’s peak\\nhours, which is from midday to early afternoon. Routine eye exams can help you\\nkeep track of your family’s vision and eye health. Leave your eye care needs\\nto Lumen Optometric. We specialize in myopia management, orthokeratology,\\nneurolens treatment and more!

It affects the\\ncornea, or the clear layer that covers your eye’s iris and protects the pupil.\\nLumen Optometric discusses its causes, symptoms, and treatment. What Causes a\\nScratched Cornea? Anything that comes into contact with the clear surface of\\nyour eyes can lead to a corneal abrasion. Rubbing your eyes too hard can cause\\na scratched cornea, as well as a grain of dust or sand getting lodged on the\\nfront of your eye. Wearing contact lenses longer than is recommended and\\npoking your eye accidentally can also lead to this type of eye injury. The\\nrisk of a scratched cornea increases when you experience dry eye syndrome.\\nBeing diagnosed with this condition makes it hard for you to sleep, since the\\neyelids may stick to the cornea. Upon waking up, your eyelids may tear a part\\nof your cornea, resulting in a scratch or abrasion. What Are the Symptoms of a\\nScratched Cornea? Any eye injury, including a corneal abrasion, must be\\nexamined by your eye doctor. Visit them right away if you start experiencing\\nany of these symptoms: Blurry vision.Eye pain that doesn’t resolve in minutes\\nor hours.Feeling that something’s stuck in your eye.Foreign matter lodged in\\nfront of your eyes like dirt or small particles.Light sensitivity How Is\\nCorneal Abrasion Treated? Before you visit your eye doctor, consider reducing\\nthe symptoms and the risk of infection. You can rinse the affected eye with\\nsaline solution to dislodge specks of dust or dirt. Try blinking several times\\nas well to move the small particles from the cornea to the eyelashes. Your eye\\ndoctor will examine the affected eye and remove any objects they may find. To\\nminimize discomfort during this prescription, they’ll apply anesthetic eye\\ndrops. They may prescribe you with eye drops to keep the eye lubricated and\\nminimize infection and inflammation, as well as oral medication if you feel\\npain or light sensitivity. The healing time varies depending on how small or\\nlarge the corneal abrasion is. Turn to Lumen Optometric for your immediate and\\nongoing optic needs.

October 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Cutting\\ncorners is never an option when it comes to proper eye care. As such, you’ll\\nwant to know which type of contact lenses best suit your needs and\\npreferences, so it does its job while not getting in the way of your daily\\nroutine. However, with so many specific choices available, it can be a bit\\noverwhelming to work out which type of lenses are best for your use. To help\\nyou determine your most preferred type of contact lenses, corneal reshaping\\nexpert Lumen Optometric has put together a quick comparison between daily and\\nmonthly contact lenses, and which is most ideal for your daily use. Daily\\nContact Lenses Also known as daily disposables, they come ready to insert in\\nindividual blister packs for one-day use. When the day’s done and you’re about\\nto sleep in for the night, just dispose of your lenses in the trash. When you\\nwake up, you open another blister pack for a new pair. You don’t need to worry\\nabout cleaning or storing the lenses each time you use daily contact lenses\\nsince they’re disposable. They’re also generally very thin and have a high\\nwater content, and if you remove these contacts during the day for any reason,\\nyou’ll need to replace them with a fresh new pair. Monthly Contact Lenses\\nThese lenses are thicker and more durable than daily lenses because they have\\nto resist drying out while you store and use them for 30 days. When you aren’t\\nwearing them, you can store the contact lenses in a small two-sided container\\nwith some contact solution. When using monthly contact lenses, you need to\\nclean them to avoid infections and protein buildup. There are various contact\\nsolutions you can use to clean monthly lenses, and you should only use the\\nones recommended by your eye doctor. This is because different brands and\\ntypes of solutions that use different chemicals can be incompatible and even\\ndestroy a contact they’re not designed for. Which is More Ideal for Your Use?\\nThe type of contact lenses you’ll use can actually depend on what your trusted\\neye doctor prescribes you. Your prescription might determine whether you\\nchoose monthly or daily contact lenses, but not all types of contacts are\\navailable for every prescription. For instance, if you need multifocal lenses,\\nsome are only available as monthlies. But if your prescription allows you to\\nuse both daily and monthly lenses, then you can consider which is better for\\nyour lifestyle. If your lifestyle makes it likely that something may get in\\nyour eye, then having daily disposables means you can just take out the lens\\nand throw it out so you won’t have to bother with trying to clean the contact\\nof any contaminants. This is especially handy if you work outdoors or don’t\\nhave easy access to facilities to clean and store your contact lenses. But if\\nyou have a controlled lifestyle and always have access to a washroom and\\nmirror to remove and clean your lenses if needed, then monthlies could work\\nbetter for your daily use. When you need to have your eyes checked by a\\ntrusted eye exam doctor, don’t hesitate to visit Lumen Optometric.

Apart from this, you may also\\nexperience the following symptoms: eye painlight sensitivityblurry\\nvisionredness or discomfort in the eyesseeing haloseyelid\\ntwitchingheadachegritty feeling in the eyestemporary loss of vision These\\nsymptoms can last for one or two days.

AMD typically occurs as\\naging causes damage to the macula, a part of the retina that controls sharp\\nvision. While it does not cause total blindness, AMD makes it harder for\\npeople to perform their daily routines, such as reading, driving, or doing any\\nclose-up work. In this article, Lumen Optometric, known for high-quality\\neyeglasses and contact lenses, explains everything you need to know about AMD.\\nWhat Are the Different Types and Symptoms of AMD? There are two types of AMD:\\ndry and wet. Dry AMD, also called atrophic AMD, occurs when the macula gets\\nthinner and progresses slowly over many years. It also has three stages:\\nearly, intermediate, and late. During the early and intermediate dry AMD\\nstage, some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience mild\\nblurriness in their central vision. On the other hand, wet AMD, also called\\nadvanced neovascular AMD, is a less common type of late AMD. It happens when\\nabnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, which eventually causes\\ndamage to the macula. As such, wet AMD causes faster vision loss. It’s\\nimportant to note that any stage of dry AMD can turn into wet AMD, but wet AMD\\nis always late. People with late AMD may notice straight lines looking wavy or\\ncrooked. They may also see a blurry area near the center of their vision,\\nwhich may get bigger as time goes by. Some people report seeing blank spots or\\nhaving trouble seeing in low lighting. If you experience any of these\\nsymptoms, be sure to see an optometrist immediately. How Do Doctors Diagnose\\nAMD? One effective way to check if you have AMD is through an eye exam. Your\\neye exam doctor may also perform any of the following procedures to diagnose\\nAMD successfully: Distance and near vision acuity testsDilated eye examination\\n(which also includes using an ophthalmoscope) — The pupil of your eye is\\ndilated to allow your doctor to observe your macula at the inside back wall of\\nthe eye.Optical coherence tomography testing (OCT) — To gain a clearer picture\\nof your macula and its supporting layers, OCT generates high-quality images of\\nthe eye.

It affects all of the\\nsystems of the body, including the eyes. The decrease in estrogen levels can\\nalter one’s eyesight. Even the shape of the eyes undergoes a slight change,\\nmaking it hard for women to wear contact lenses comfortably. Eye Conditions\\nAssociated With Menopause The following are some of the most common eye\\nconditions that affect women during menopause: Dry Eyes – Women over the age\\nof 50 have been shown to be at high risk of developing symptoms of dry eye\\nsyndrome such as blurred vision, light sensitivity and swollen or reddened\\neyelids. The decrease in hormone levels can also lower the salinity of the\\ninner tear film and the oils of the outer tear film. Cataracts – Decreased\\nhormone levels can also increase the risk for cataracts. Common signs and\\nsymptoms include seeing fading colors and halos around light sources and\\nhaving difficulty seeing at night. Scheduling regular visits to your eye exam\\ndoctor can help detect this condition early. Glaucoma – This eye condition is\\nalso common in menopausal women. It leads to the damage of the optic nerve,\\nusually from increased eye pressure. Early detection and treatment can help\\nprotect the eyes from vision loss associated with glaucoma. Eye Care During\\nMenopause Taking a proactive approach is the best way to preserve your vision\\nduring your menopause years. In addition to annual eye exams, your eye doctor\\nmay recommend hormone therapy to restore your estrogen levels. While it may\\nhelp reduce the risk of developing these eye conditions, patients who undergo\\nsuch are four to seven times more likely to develop dry eye symptoms. Other\\nways to control menopause symptoms include a more natural approach like taking\\nherbal supplements and consuming a diet rich in Vitamin D. Lifestyle changes\\ncan also help reduce dry eye symptoms like removing drafts and wearing\\nwraparound sunglasses outdoors.

We will be discussing the four best ways to treat your myopia so it no\\nlonger gets worse. Everything we discuss is based on solid science and\\nresearch, double-masked clinical trials, and recommendations based on\\nmountains of peer-reviewed data. Certainly, we’ve heard and researched other\\nmore holistic approaches, if they turn out to be effective, know that this is\\nsurely a growing field however and as things change you’ll certainly hear it\\nfrom us first! What is Myopia? Before you can defeat your enemy, you need to\\nknow exactly what it is. Myopia is a disease of the eye that is usually the\\nresult of an eyeball that has grown too long. We call how long the eyeball is\\nthe ‘axial length’. When the axial length grows excessively long, your vision\\nwill suffer in direct correlation. So any treatment we discuss has to show\\nefficacy in its ability to reduce axial length elongation compared to a\\ncontrol group. Other times, the cornea may be too steep which can also cause\\nmyopia. However, for the sake of this article, we will address the major cause\\nof myopia which is the excessive axial length of the eye. As when we talk\\nabout managing myopia, we will be talking about ways that have shown clinical\\nevidence in slowing down axial length growth. Custom Orthokeratology or\\nOvernight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed\\ncontact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while\\nsleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names\\nfor orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping\\nsystem, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the\\ncurvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While\\ninitially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see\\nmore clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in\\nreducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused\\nin front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the\\noptical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact\\nlenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning, and\\ndisinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper\\nhygiene this is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating\\nchildren of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that\\ncan be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to\\ntreat children with amblyopia, or sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be\\nused to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well.\\nWhat we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of\\natropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of\\naction is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of\\nthe eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at\\nwhich the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic\\nprogression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are\\nbeing designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight\\ncontact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia\\nby almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers\\nthroughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral\\nretina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact\\nlens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia\\nas well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating\\nEyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a\\nsimilar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is\\na particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact\\nlenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s\\nbodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of\\npower in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial\\nlength elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good\\nnews is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids—just like\\nyours—so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above\\nare four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been\\ndiagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with\\na contact lens while sleeping. Atropine involves an eye drop that can signal\\nthe eye to grow a little slower. Custom soft multifocal lenses are worn during\\nthe day. And even specially designed glasses are on the horizon to improve the\\nprogression of myopia. The Treehouse Eyes eye doctors use state-of-the-art\\nequipment to develop a personalized treatment plan for your child. Our non-\\ninvasive treatments include customized contact lenses and special prescription\\neye drops. Moreover, data shows that our patent-pending Treehouse Vision\\nSystem® treatment plan can decrease myopia progression by 78%. Give your child\\nthe tools they need to succeed!

But with so many of these conditions identified by\\nthe medical community, it can be hard to list down all of their possible\\neffects on the eyes. Understanding the risk your specific autoimmune disorder\\nposes to your vision is key to ensuring optimal eye health. Consult your eye\\ndoctor immediately if you start experiencing eyesight problems. In this blog,\\nLumen Optometric, your trusted eye care center for neurolens® treatment,\\nshares some of the autoimmune disorders that affect the eyes. Lupus It is a\\ntype of autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly\\nattacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body, including the eyes. It can\\nlead to eye-related conditions like retinal vascular lesions and optic\\nneuropathy. Symptoms may include blurred vision, sore or dry eyes, and light\\nsensitivity. Rheumatoid Arthritis It is a chronic multisystem disease with\\nmusculoskeletal manifestations. While it primarily targets the hands, arms,\\nlegs and feet, this inflammatory disorder can also affect the eyes. Dry eye\\nsyndrome, however, is the most common eye condition to accompany rheumatoid\\narthritis. A visit to an eye doctor can help determine necessary dry eye\\ntreatment to alleviate discomfort. Other eye-related conditions associated\\nwith rheumatoid arthritis include scleritis (inflammation of the white part of\\nthe eye) and uveitis (inflammation of the tissues in the eyewall). Multiple\\nSclerosis This autoimmune disorder affects the central nervous system. Given\\nthat the optic nerve is directly connected to it, an individual may be\\ndiagnosed with MS after the development of initial symptoms of vision\\nproblems. Optic neuritis, for instance, can bring a combination of color\\nvision loss, blurred vision and double vision that usually affects only one\\neye. Turn to Lumen Optometric for your immediate and ongoing optic needs. Our\\ntalented eye exam doctor is expertly trained to identify vision problems and\\ncustomize effective solutions to improve your eye health. Our scleral\\noptometrist is also ready to assist with your contact lens needs. Call (626)\\n921-0199 or fill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

Continue reading as a trusted eye exam doctor further\\ndiscusses the importance of having your eyes checked post-concussion. Visual\\nDisturbances and Concussions Concussions can lead to a range of visual\\ndisturbances, such as blurred vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia) and\\ndifficulty focusing. These symptoms may not be immediately apparent but can\\nmanifest in the days or weeks following the injury. A post-concussion eye exam\\nhelps identify and address these issues, promoting a more effective recovery.\\nDetecting Ocular Motor Dysfunction Concussions often affect the coordination\\nof eye movements, known as ocular motor function. This can result in\\ndifficulties with tracking objects, maintaining focus or experiencing eye\\nstrain. A specialized eye examination can pinpoint ocular motor dysfunction,\\nguiding the implementation of targeted therapies to improve eye coordination\\nand alleviate associated symptoms. Assessing Binocular Vision Problems\\nBinocular vision problems, where the eyes struggle to work together\\nseamlessly, are common after concussions. This can lead to double vision,\\ndepth perception challenges and discomfort. Through a comprehensive check, an\\neye doctor can assess binocular vision problems and recommend appropriate\\ninterventions, such as vision therapy or corrective lenses. Addressing Light\\nSensitivity Photophobia is a frequent symptom post-concussion. Exposure to\\nlight can exacerbate headaches and discomfort, whether you’re wearing\\neyeglasses or contact lenses. Optometrists can evaluate the extent of light\\nsensitivity during an eye exam and recommend strategies to manage it\\neffectively. This may include specialized lenses or advice on controlling\\nlighting environments. Preventing Prolonged Visual Symptoms Early detection\\nand intervention are key to preventing prolonged visual symptoms after a\\nconcussion. Without proper assessment and treatment, visual issues may persist\\nand impact daily life. Timely eye exams can identify underlying problems and\\nenable the implementation of targeted therapies, promoting a smoother recovery\\nprocess.

(While staring at a\\ncomputer screen, you tend to blink less often. This increases the risk of dry\\neye because blinking is how a tear film—which helps keep your eyes moist—is\\nspread across the surface of your eye.) However, recent studies have shown\\nthat having diabetes mellitus increases your risk for dry eyes. Lumen\\nOptometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, explains how diabetes and dry eyes\\nare connected and elaborate on the possible treatment options below: How\\nDiabetes and Dry Eyes Are Connected Some medical researchers believe diabetic\\nneuropathy can explain the connection between diabetes and dry eyes.\\nNeuropathy happens when some of the nerves are damaged. It’s also a risk\\nfactor for lacrimal gland dysfunction. If the lacrimal gland (which secretes\\nthe watery component of the tear film) is damaged, tear production decreases.\\nThis, in turn, increases a patient’s risk for dry eyes. Important: Diabetes is\\njust one of several factors that can increase your risk for dry eyes. Other\\nfactors include age (it’s not uncommon for people aged over 65 to experience\\ndry eyes) and environmental conditions (tears evaporate more quickly in dry\\nclimates). If you have any of the aforementioned risk factors, you should\\nundergo an eye exam at least once a year. Through routine eye exams, your eye\\ndoctor can detect and treat eye conditions before they progress or give higher\\nprescriptions for contact lenses before blurry vision interferes with your\\ndaily routines. How Are Dry Eyes Treated Your eye doctor may recommend the\\nfollowing treatment options: Artificial tears – To alleviate the symptoms of\\nmild or moderate dry eyes, you may need to apply artificial tears several\\ntimes during the day. Eye inserts – An eye insert resembles a grain of rice\\nand releases lubrication as it dissolves. It is placed between your lower\\neyelid and your eyeball.

These lenses offer a smooth transition\\nbetween distances, eliminating the need for multiple glasses. They can also\\nhelp treat other eye conditions. However, progressive lenses have pros and\\ncons like any vision correction option. In this article, we explore the\\nadvantages and disadvantages of progressive lenses to help you decide whether\\nthey are the right choice for you. Pros of Progressive Lenses Here are some of\\nthe benefits of progressive lenses. Improved Vision Progressive lenses provide\\na more seamless transition between different prescriptions, allowing for\\nclearer vision at all distances. Wearers can see objects at varying lengths\\nwithout switching glasses or straining their eyes. Greater Comfort Progressive\\nlenses eliminate the visible lines that come with traditional bifocals or\\ntrifocals. This makes them a more comfortable option for extended wear,\\nparticularly for activities like driving or using a computer. More Natural\\nVision Progressive lenses provide a more natural visual experience than\\ntraditional bifocals or reading glasses. This is because they offer a gradual\\nchange in prescription, mimicking how the eyes naturally adjust to different\\ndistances. Improved Aesthetics With no visible line, progressive lenses\\nprovide a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. This appeals to those who\\nwant to avoid the stigma of traditional bifocals or reading glasses. Cons of\\nProgressive Lenses Despite their many advantages, there are drawbacks to\\nprogressive lenses. These include the following: Cost Progressive lenses can\\nbe more expensive than traditional bifocals or reading glasses because they\\nrequire more advanced technology. This can be a barrier for those on a budget\\nor without insurance coverage for vision correction. Adaptation Period\\nAdjusting to progressive lenses can take some time. This can cause some\\ninitial discomfort or disorientation. Reduced Peripheral Vision Since\\nprogressive lenses have a narrow corridor of clear vision, wearers may\\nexperience reduced peripheral vision. This can be a safety concern, especially\\nwhen driving or navigating unfamiliar environments. Increased Risk of Glare\\nProgressive lenses can create more reflections and glare, particularly in\\nbright light conditions. This can be an issue for those outdoors or in\\nenvironments with bright lighting. How to Adapt to Progressive Lenses When\\nadapting to progressive lenses, allow a few days for your eyes to get used to\\nyour new lens prescription. Practice focusing on familiar objects that are\\nlocated at different distances from you so you can easily switch between far\\nand near vision when needed. Patience also goes a long way in getting used to\\nprogressive lenses. To be sure that progressive lenses are right for you,\\nschedule a consultation at Lumen Optometric. Our experts can assist you with\\neverything from Neurolens treatment to dry eye treatment in Sierra Madre, CA.\\nIf you are also looking for a scleral optometrist, you can get in touch with\\nus.

As a parent, you also want to make\\nsure that your child can see well enough to do the things they enjoy doing.\\nPediatric optometrists are specialized healthcare professionals who care for\\nthe visual and ocular needs of infants, children, and teens. In this article,\\nwe will discuss some factors you must consider when choosing an optometrist\\nfor your children. Location Location is essential when choosing the best\\noptometrist for kids near you. If your child has a busy schedule, it may be\\nmore difficult for them to travel long distances to get to their appointments.\\nMaybe you’re unsure about how far away from home an office is. Ask the doctor\\nor staff if they have any recommendations on other practices they could\\nrecommend that might better suit your needs. Call ahead if multiple offices\\nare within driving distance of your home. Make sure each office offers the\\nsame services before making an appointment with them. Experience The\\nexperience of an optometrist for children is one of the most important factors\\nto consider when choosing the best eye doctor for kids. An excellent way to\\ngauge this is by asking how long they’ve been practicing optometry and whether\\nthey have additional training relevant to your child’s specific needs (such as\\nmyopia management). Treehouse Eyes provides expert pediatric myopia care and\\nensures this with accessibility to Treehouse AMP, a video-based parent\\neducation platform. Treehouse Eyes doctors are always willing to answer any\\nquestions regarding myopia and while also cultivating a kid-friendly office\\nexperience. Recommendations The best way to find a pediatric optometrist you\\ncan rely on and who will get along well with your child is through referrals\\nand recommendations. If you know someone who had a positive experience with an\\neye doctor, find out who they used and why they thought so highly of them.\\nConsider that some of your friends have young children of their own. Before\\nchoosing which practice is best for you and your family, it might be useful to\\nknow what kind of experiences other people have had there. If no one in your\\nfamily or circle of friends can personally recommend an optometrist, look\\nonline for reviews of nearby practices. You can also use the Google Maps\\nbusiness filter by typing “optometrist for children near me” into the search\\nbar. You can add whatever city or town you live in and see the reviews. This\\nshould bring up several options nearby where children receive treatment from\\nprofessionals specializing in vision care issues explicitly related to young\\npeople (such as myopia). Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye\\ndrops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We\\nwill be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child\\nat the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor. Schedule a\\nconsultation now to find out more.

The right glasses are comfortable and give\\nyou sharp vision throughout the day. Despite the dependability of this\\neyewear, it can still cause spots or pimples to form on your face.\\nFortunately, there are several ways to avoid this issue. Here’s what you can\\ndo to prevent breakouts from wearing eyeglasses. Clean Your Glasses Frequently\\nThe pressure that eyeglasses put on your skin is what usually causes acne. It\\nprevents dead skin cells from shedding, causing them to clog your pores and\\nform pimples. If you have oily skin or wear thick layers of makeup, you are\\nmore likely to get breakouts from eyeglass wear. Regularly cleaning your\\neyeglasses will help prevent breakouts. You can use an alcohol wipe to clean\\nthem, focusing on areas that touch your skin. Have Your Glasses Adjusted Does\\nit feel like your glasses are so heavy or pushing too hard on your nose?\\nExcessive pressure from your glasses can contribute to breakouts. If this is\\nthe case, see your eye doctor and have your eyeglass frame adjusted. In some\\ncases, replacing the nose bridges allow more even pressure distribution. Give\\nYour Face a Break from Eyeglasses When you wear eyeglasses every day, it’s\\neasy to forget that you even have them on. While they give you sharper vision,\\nit helps to take breaks from wearing them from time to time. It relieves the\\npressure on your face that often contributes to breakouts. Remove Your Makeup\\nat the End of the Day Thoroughly remove your makeup at the end of the day.\\nCosmetic products can accumulate under your glasses, increasing the likelihood\\nof acne. Using makeup remover before cleansing ensures that you’re really\\ngetting rid of the products on your face. Don’t wait for your vision to change\\nbefore seeing your eye doctor.

Without proper treatment,\\nvision problems can affect a child’s learning, increase the risk of permanent\\nvision loss and even lead to behavioral issues. The American Optometric\\nAssociation strongly recommends your little one see an eye exam doctor yearly.\\nThis Healthy Vision Month, we are sharing tips on taking a proactive approach\\nto your child’s eye health. Avoid Excess Screen Time At least two screen time\\nincreases the risk of obesity, mood swings, aggressive behavior and obesity in\\nchildren. The blue light from digital devices can contribute to digital eye\\nstrain. This eye condition is usually characterized by blurred vision, dry\\neye, headaches, and neck and shoulder pain. According to the Department of\\nHealth, children below two should have no screen time because it can affect\\nphysical and language development. Schedule Regular Eye Exams It’s a common\\nmisconception that you only need to see an eye care specialist if you need to\\nupdate your contact lenses or eyeglasses. Regular eye exams can detect and\\ntreat eye conditions early in adults and children. If you see your child\\nconstantly squinting, tilting their head, or rubbing their eyes, schedule an\\nappointment with your eye doctor immediately. These are common signs of vision\\nproblems in young individuals. Prepare Well-Balanced Meals Incorporating leafy\\ngreens and foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids in your daily meals is beneficial\\nto the entire family’s eye health. Vitamin A in leafy greens can lower the\\nrisk of dry eye syndrome, while omega-3 fatty acids can lower the risk of\\ncataracts and age-related macular degeneration. It’s also a good idea to\\nconsume fruits rich in vitamins C and E, such as pineapples, oranges,\\nstrawberries and mangoes. These vitamins can help restore tissues in your eyes\\nand prevent infections. Moreover, an overall balanced diet is essential in\\npreventing obesity and hypertension, which contribute to several eye diseases.\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we are committed to restoring your vision and helping you\\nmaintain good eye health.

Protecting your eyes from the sun’s damage is crucial to\\nmaintaining good eye health and preventing problems down the road. This blog\\npost discusses the risks of UV exposure and provides you with practical tips\\nfor keeping your eyes safe from the sun’s harmful effects. Understand the\\nRisks of UV Exposure UV exposure can have both short-term and long-term\\neffects on your eyes. In the short term, you may experience photokeratitis,\\nalso known as “sunburn of the eye,” or pterygium, a growth on the white of the\\neye. Long-term damage includes cataracts and macular degeneration. Some\\nindividuals are at higher risk for UV-related eye problems, such as outdoor\\nworkers and those with light-colored eyes. Choose the Right Sunglasses The\\nright pair of sunglasses can play a significant role in protecting your eyes\\nfrom UV damage. Look for sunglasses labeled with 100% UVA and UVB protection.\\nLens color and tint can also make a difference. Gray, green and brown lenses\\ncan help maintain color recognition. Consider polarized lenses to reduce\\nglare, especially if you spend a lot of time near water or snow. Wraparound\\nframes offer added protection by shielding your eyes from sunlight entering\\nfrom the sides. Wear a Wide-Brimmed Hat A wide-brimmed hat can provide\\nadditional protection from indirect sunlight. By reducing your exposure to\\nharmful UV rays, you can lower the risk of eye damage. Schedule Regular Eye\\nExams Early detection and prevention are essential to maintaining good eye\\nhealth. Regular visits to an eye exam doctor can help you monitor changes in\\nyour vision and eye health. Comprehensive exams can catch problems early,\\ngiving you the best chance for successful treatment. Consider Protective\\nContact Lenses For contact lens wearers, UV-blocking contact lenses can offer\\nan added layer of protection against the sun’s harmful rays. Consult an\\noptometrist to determine which type of contact lenses are best suited for you.\\nExplore Orthokeratology Orthokeratology or ortho-k, is a treatment that\\ninvolves wearing specially designed contact lenses overnight to reshape the\\ncornea. This non-surgical procedure can help reduce the risk of UV damage to\\nthe eye and improve vision. Take Precautions During Peak Sun Hours Avoiding\\ndirect sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. can help protect your eyes from\\nharmful UV rays. If you must be outdoors during these hours, seek shade\\nwhenever possible. Educate Children on Eye Protection Teaching children about\\nthe importance of eye protection from a young age is crucial for maintaining\\ntheir long-term eye health. Encourage kids to wear sunglasses and hats when\\noutdoors to shield their eyes from the sun. Protecting your eyes from UV\\ndamage is essential for maintaining good eye health. By understanding the\\nrisks and taking the necessary precautions, you can reduce your chances of\\ndeveloping UV-related eye problems.

Around 30%\\nof teenagers, 9% of kids in school, and 5% of preschoolers have it. If both of\\na child’s parents are nearsighted, the child is more likely to have myopia.\\nMyopia is generally on the rise, particularly in children. Experts believe\\nthat it might have something to do with spending more time indoors playing\\nvideo games and using electronic gadgets. Read on to learn about some of the\\nbest myopia treatment options for children. The Development of Myopia When a\\nchild’s eyeball grows too rapidly relative to the usual pace of eye growth,\\nmyopia occurs. It may also develop if the cornea, the transparent window in\\nfront of the eye, curves too sharply. Light rays are unable to reach the\\nretina when they enter the eye, which makes nearby objects look clear and\\ndistant objects look blurry. Treating Myopia in Childhood Although it cannot\\nbe cured or reversed, myopia can be managed and treated. The treatment’s\\nobjectives are to strengthen your child’s vision and stop it from\\ndeteriorating. Managing myopia is crucial for maintaining their eye health.\\nTreatment Options to Combat Myopia Progression: Specialized Contact Lenses:\\nCustomized multifocal contact lenses are tailored to address myopia\\nprogression by slowing down eye growth in some children. Additionally,\\northokeratology, also known as Ortho-K, offers a unique solution by reshaping\\nthe cornea overnight, thus ensuring clearer vision throughout the day. Low-\\nDose Atropine Eye Drops: Children may benefit from the use of low-dose\\natropine eye drops, similar to those administered during routine eye\\nexaminations. This treatment approach has shown promise in managing myopia\\nprogression effectively. Increasing Outdoor Time: Encouraging children to\\nspend more time outdoors can help counteract the onset and progression of\\nmyopia. Balancing screen time with outdoor activities is vital for\\nsafeguarding their eye health as they continue to grow. Consultation with a\\nTreehouse Eyes Provider: For parents unsure about the most suitable treatment\\noption for their child, consulting with a qualified optometrist is essential.\\nOptometrists with myopia management expertise can provide personalized\\nrecommendations and guidance tailored to each child’s specific needs and\\ncircumstances. In conclusion, addressing myopia in children requires a\\ncomprehensive approach focused on effective treatment strategies and proactive\\nmanagement techniques. By leveraging innovative solutions and collaborating\\nwith eye care professionals, parents can ensure optimal vision health for\\ntheir children both now and in the future. If you’re not sure which treatment\\nwould be the best choice, consult your optometrist to determine how you can\\nmanage your child’s myopia.

This eye condition can cause cloudy or blurred\\nvision and increased light sensitivity. Patients may also experience poor\\nnight vision or notice that colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. While\\ncataracts usually occur in older adults, this eye condition can happen to\\nanyone. A local scleral optometrist shares the different types of cataracts.\\nTypes of Cataracts Age-Related Cataracts Cataracts can occur due to the\\nchanges in your eyes as you age. You’re more prone to age-related cataracts if\\nyou drink alcohol excessively, smoke cigarettes, take steroids and have\\ndiabetes. A family history of this eye condition and past eye surgeries also\\nincreases your risk for this eye condition. Congenital Cataracts Some people\\nare born with cataracts or develop them in the first year of life. It’s not\\ncommon for children to have cataracts. If your child’s cataracts are large\\nenough to impact vision, immediate treatment is necessary to avoid further eye\\nproblems, like amblyopia or lazy eye. Traumatic Cataracts Blunt and\\npenetrating eye injuries usually cause traumatic cataracts. This form of\\ncataract may develop immediately or years after the eye injury. Secondary\\nCataracts There is a chance for scar tissue to develop in the eye after\\ncataract surgery. If this happens, your vision will become cloudy again.\\nSecondary cataracts are more common than you think and occur in two out of\\nfive people who get cataract surgery. A quick and non-invasive procedure\\ncalled YAG laser capsulotomy is the typical treatment for this type of\\ncataract. Patients usually gain normal vision a few days following treatment.\\nHow Are Cataracts Diagnosed? Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial for\\nthe early detection of vision-threatening conditions like macular degeneration\\nand cataracts. Individuals older than 60 should schedule a dilated eye exam\\nevery one to two years. During your appointment, your eye care provider will\\nuse dilating eye drops to widen your pupil and check for signs of cataracts\\nand other eye issues. Your doctor might also perform a refraction test,\\nophthalmoscopy and slit lamp test. These tests will help them determine if you\\nneed new prescription glasses or dry eye treatment. How Are Cataracts Treated?\\nIf you have cataracts, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. In the\\ninitial stages of this eye condition, prescription glasses or contact lenses\\ncan help improve vision. You can also use brighter lights in your home and\\nwear anti-glare sunglasses outdoors. Moreover, your eye doctor will recommend\\nsurgery if cataracts are starting to disrupt your daily tasks. You don’t need\\nto wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor. Leave your\\neye care needs to Lumen Optometric. Besides comprehensive eye exams, we also\\noffer neurolens treatment, scleral lenses and orthokeratology. Call us at\\n(626) 921-0199 or complete our online form to schedule an appointment.

In\\nthis article, eye care specialists take a look at profiles of patients who may\\nneed extra UV eye protection. Construction Workers: Construction workers and\\nother people who work outdoors are exposed to 10-20% more UV light than the\\naverage indoor worker. Even if a worker wears a hat outside, the brim can only\\nblock their eyes from overhead UV light and not the indirect UV radiation that\\nis reflected on low-level surfaces. Outdoor Enthusiasts: Outdoor enthusiasts\\nsuch as cyclists and hikers spend a lot of time in the sun, thus requiring\\nsome protection from UV. Boaters and beachgoers should also equip themselves\\nwith eye protection because dry sand can reflect more than 15% of UV light\\nwhile sea foam can reflect up to 30%. Children: Some kids tend to spend more\\ntime outdoors than adults. Long-term effects of sun damage are cumulative. The\\nlonger children are not protected from the harmful rays of the sun, the more\\nlikely they will suffer damage to their eyes in their older years. Contact\\nLens Wearers: Some patients who wear contact lenses do not bother to wear\\nsunglasses because their contacts block UVA/UVB. While there are lenses that\\nprotect from UV radiation, they do not cover everything. The skin of the lids\\nand brow bone are left vulnerable and should be covered with a pair of\\nsunglasses. Health-Conscious Individuals: If you are conscious about your\\nhealth, you want to minimize your day-to-day interaction with environmental\\nhazards. Aside from eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly,\\nsafeguarding your eyes from UV radiation should be on your priority list,\\nespecially if you have a family history of age-related macular degeneration.\\nLumen Optometric is a premier eye care center specializing in comprehensive\\neye exams, myopia management, scleral lenses, neurolenses and more.

As such, the process of making prescription lenses\\ninvolves several steps. Continue reading to learn about prescription lenses,\\nhow they are made and the different types available. What Are Prescription\\nLenses? Prescription lenses are tailored spectacles that correct or improve\\nthe wearer’s vision. A dedicated optometrist assesses the unique needs of your\\neyes and prescribes lenses that adjust how light gets into your eyes, helping\\nyou see better. The Process of Making Prescription Lenses Making prescription\\nlenses involves several steps, from the initial eye examination to the final\\nfitting of the lenses into the frames. Here is a general overview of the\\nprocess. Eye Exam The process begins with an eye examination by an eye doctor.\\nDuring the exam, they will determine your specific vision prescription, which\\nincludes measurements for each eye, such as sphere power (for nearsightedness\\nor farsightedness), cylinder power (for astigmatism) and axis (the orientation\\nof astigmatism correction). If you have presbyopia, your doctor may also\\ndetermine your reading prescription. Eye exams can also check for eye diseases\\nso your doctor can prescribe the appropriate solution. For those with special\\neye conditions, you may need to see a specialist, such as a scleral\\noptometrist, to get the treatment and visual clarity your eyes need. Lens\\nCrafting After the examination, your optometrist sends the prescription to a\\nlab where your lenses will be crafted. Here, a machine cuts the lens into the\\nshape advised by your optometrist based on your prescription’s specifications.\\nLens Finishing Lastly, your lenses undergo additional treatments. These can\\ninclude anti-reflective or scratch-resistant coatings, color tints, or UV\\nprotection. These coatings improve the clarity and durability of your lenses.\\nTypes of Prescription Lenses There are various types of prescription lenses\\navailable to correct vision problems and suit individual needs. These lenses\\nare typically used in eyeglasses and may include single-vision lenses, with a\\nsingle prescription power throughout the entire lens. They correct\\nnearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. Bifocals have two different\\nprescription powers in a single lens. The upper part corrects distance vision,\\nwhile the lower is for near vision. They are commonly prescribed for\\nindividuals who have difficulty seeing both up close and at a distance. This\\ncondition is often seen in people over 40 with presbyopia. There are other\\nspecialty lenses available for specific needs, such as sports goggles and\\nlenses for low-vision individuals. The type of prescription lens you need\\ndepends on your vision correction requirements and lifestyle. An eye care\\nprofessional will assess your vision and recommend the most suitable lens type\\nfor your needs. Lumen Optometric is one of the area’s leading eye specialists.\\nFrom eye exams to dry eye treatment, you can count on us to provide quality\\neye care. We also offer neurolens treatment.

July 7, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Occasional headaches can be\\nmanageable for some people. But when these headaches begin to affect your\\neyesight or if your vision problems start coinciding with headaches, it can be\\na lot harder for anyone to bear. In this post, Lumen Optometric — a trusted\\nprovider of eyeglasses and contact lenses — discusses how headaches and vision\\ncan be interconnected. Types of Headaches That Can Affect Your Vision\\nMigraines and cluster headaches are the usual types of headache that can\\naffect your vision. Migraines are often described as intense pain in and\\naround the eyes. A “migraine aura” usually precedes them, and it often\\nresembles flashing lights, a prismatic rainbow of lights, or a zigzag pattern\\nof shimmering lights. Meanwhile, cluster headaches usually occur in clusters\\nand cause pain around the eyes. The pain typically radiates down the neck\\nincluding the shoulders and comes with other symptoms like red eyes, changes\\nin pupil size, eyelid droop, and nasal drainage. Vision Problems That Can\\nTrigger Headaches Headaches caused by vision problems usually start when the\\neyes are overworked and you can’t maintain focus. Make sure to visit an eye\\nexam doctor if you are experiencing any of the following: Eye Strain – This is\\ncommon among people who work in front of digital screens for several hours and\\nso they tend to overuse the focusing muscles of their eyes. When eye muscles\\nbecome fatigued, a headache can be felt specifically around or behind the\\neyes. Farsightedness – A frontal headache or brow ache may occur if a person\\nis farsighted. Farsightedness can make it difficult for a person to focus on\\nnearby objects, making it possible for eye strain and headaches to develop.\\nAcute Angle-Closure Glaucoma (AACG) – A rare type of glaucoma, it causes the\\neye pressure to rise quickly and often results in eye pain, eye redness,\\ncloudy vision, and an onset of headaches. Lumen Optometric offers exceptional\\neye care services. Our expertise includes orthokeratology, scleral lenses,\\nNeurolens® therapy, and more.

February 11, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Whether\\nyou’re working in a desk job or you’re attending online classes, there’s a big\\npossibility that you keep looking at a computer screen for hours on end. As\\nsuch, you may experience migraines from time to time. Migraines can cause\\nslight discomfort and may even affect your vision and ability to see clearly.\\nThere are two types of migraine you might have heard of: visual and ocular.\\nWhile both migraines involve changes in your vision, there are ways to tell\\nthem apart. Lumen Optometric, known for quality dry eye treatment services,\\nexplains the difference between visual and ocular migraines. Visual Migraine\\nVisual migraine is a temporary visual impairment that may occur simultaneously\\nin both eyes. Most visual migraines last for 30 minutes, but depending on your\\nstress levels and overall health, they may last longer. You may also\\nexperience a migraine headache shortly after a visual migraine. The symptoms\\nof visual migraine may vary. These include: Flickering blind spot in the\\ncenter or near the center of your peripheral fieldA wavy or zigzag ring of\\ncolored light surrounding a blind spotA blind spot that slowly migrates across\\nyour line of vision If you frequently experience any of these symptoms, you\\nshould consider contacting your optometrist for a neurolens treatment. Ocular\\nMigraine Ocular migraine, on the other hand, is a rarer type of migraine.\\nUnlike visual migraine, ocular migraine only affects one eye. It causes\\ntemporary loss of vision, which occurs when there is reduced blood flow in the\\neye. Ocular migraines can also be triggered because of blood vessel spasms in\\nthe retina. It typically lasts for about an hour, and vision eventually\\nreturns. In addition, the most common symptom of ocular migraine is the\\nappearance of a blind spot. This blind spot affects your field of vision and\\nnormally appears first in the center. As the migraine worsens, the blind spot\\ngrows and gradually blocks your entire field of vision. A migraine headache\\nmay also occur before, during, or after you experience ocular migraine. Visual\\nand ocular migraines are usually nothing to be worried about, and they will\\nresolve themselves within an hour or less. Nevertheless, if these types of\\nmigraine headaches persist, be sure to book an appointment with your eye\\ndoctor.

October 14, 2022 by Lumen\\nOptometric Virtual reality (VR) headsets are becoming more commonplace and are\\nnow being used for applications other than gaming and entertainment. Since VR\\nheadsets deliver audiovisual content, Lumen Optometric takes a look at whether\\nor not VR headsets are bad for the eyes. How Do VR Headsets Work? VR headsets\\nare head-mounted devices that consist of a display screen and stereo\\nearpieces, as well as sensors and controllers that create an interactive and\\nimmersive experience. Putting on a VR headset shuts out the immediate\\nsurroundings, which means the user can only see the content projected on the\\ndisplay screen. Its sensors adjust the content orientation, which allows the\\nuser to interact with a virtual space from any direction. While mostly known\\nfor their gaming applications, VR headsets can also be used for work and\\neducation. The Effects of VR on the Eyes Similar to devices that deliver\\naudiovisual content like TVs and smartphones, VR headsets present the same\\nrisks, including eye strain and fatigue, discomfort, and blurred vision.\\nStudies have shown that the human eye tends to blink less when using digital\\nscreens. Blinking helps remove contaminants from the eyes and keeps them moist\\nand a reduced blink rate can result in dry eyes. The eyes also tend to work\\nmore as the brain tries to reconcile the differences between virtual and\\nperceived depths. VR headsets also induce visually-induced motion sickness in\\nsome people. This “cybersickness” can persist long after the user has stopped\\nwearing the headset, the symptoms of which include headaches, lightheadedness,\\ndifficulty focusing, sweating, and nausea. People who are prone to motion\\nsickness or already have problems that affect their depth perception are\\nespecially susceptible to cybersickness. How to Take Care of Your Eyes if You\\nUse VR Headsets Fortunately, there are things that you can do to help reduce\\nthe effects of wearing VR headsets. The following can also be helpful if your\\ndaily routine involves prolonged use of digital screens: Follow the “20/20/20\\nRule”. Take breaks from using your VR headset and follow the 20/20/20 rule:\\nfor every 20 minutes you spend looking at a screen, look at something that’s\\n20 feet away for 20 seconds. Moisturize your eyes. In addition to taking\\nregular breaks, apply eye drops to keep your eyes moist. Limit your usage.\\nDon’t use the VR headset longer than you have to, particularly during late\\nhours. In addition to eye strain, the constant exposure to blue light emitted\\nby the screen can affect your body’s melatonin production and affect your\\nsleep cycles. Lastly, visit your eye doctor regularly to prevent further eye\\nproblems.

When it\\ndischarges through your tear ducts, they become overwhelmed, resulting in\\nwatery eyes. This usually gets resolved without treatment, but if this is a\\nrecurring problem, refrain from wearing any contact lenses and have your eyes\\nchecked at a trusted eye center. Common Causes Normally, you produce excess\\ntears when you feel certain emotions, as well as when you laugh, vomit, cough,\\nyawn, or experience strong taste sensations. However, in some cases, the cause\\nfor watery eyes can also be dry eye syndrome. With extremely dry eyes, you’re\\nnot able to receive proper lubrication and you’ll keep producing excess tears.\\nThis happens if your tears don’t contain the right balance of water, salt, and\\noils. Your eyes become irritated which causes the overproduction of tears to\\nspill through your tear ducts. Knowing When to See a Doctor Normally, your\\nwatery eyes will clear up without any treatment. But if it keeps happening,\\nyou’ll have to see your trusted eye exam doctor for a check-up. They’ll be\\nable to determine the cause of your dry eyes so they can administer the best\\ntreatment. Sometimes, the causes can be as simple as an injured or scratched\\neye. It can also be as obvious as swollen or red eyes. But other symptoms can\\nalso be tenderness around your nose or sinuses, as well as a severe headache\\nassociated with your watery eyes. When you need a reliable specialist for\\ncorneal reshaping or other vision concerns, Lumen Optometric is the name you\\ncan trust.

March 14, 2023 by Vic Doce In\\nthis blog, discover the benefits of treating myopia early. Myopia is one of\\nthe most common vision issues among children, with 1 in 3 being myopic. It’s\\nan epidemic that is projected to affect half of the world’s population by the\\nyear 2050. At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to give children better vision for\\nlife so they can accomplish their goals and avoid other serious vision\\nproblems in the future. Short-Term Benefits of Myopia Treatment Some of the\\nshort-term benefits of myopia treatment include increased confidence in your\\nchild, better vision to engage more actively in school and other activities,\\nand an overall better quality of life. 1\\\\. Improved vision: Treehouse Eyes\\noffers a holistic approach to myopia management. Specializing in treatment\\noptions for myopia, Treehouse Eyes doctors take into account a child’s\\nbackground, genetics, and lifestyle. After evaluation, your child will receive\\nproper treatment for myopia such as contact lenses or prescription eye drops.\\n2\\\\. Better academic performance: Children with myopia may often experience\\ndifficulty reading the board or seeing the screen in a classroom setting. It\\ncan also cause a lack of confidence to speak up in class because of their\\nvision impairment. Treating myopia can help your child see clearly and give\\nthem the confidence to engage academically. 3\\\\. Reduce Eye Strain: Children\\nwith myopia may experience headaches and other symptoms from trying to focus\\non distant objects. Myopia treatment can help alleviate these symptoms for\\nyour child. 4\\\\. Increased quality of life: Treating myopia early on can help\\nimprove your child’s confidence by allowing them to participate in a wider\\nrange of activities. This can also help them excel at hobbies they currently\\nstruggle with due to their vision. Some studies show the relationship between\\nmyopia and mental health issues. Myopia management can lead to improved mental\\nhealth and overall happiness for your child. Long-term Benefits of Myopia\\nTreatment There are numerous long-term benefits to treating myopia early on,\\nwhich is where the Treehouse Eyes mission, “giving children better vision for\\nlife,” comes into play. 1\\\\. Reduce the risk of serious eye diseases: High\\nmyopia can lead to other serious eye diseases such as glaucoma, retinal\\ndetachments, macular degeneration, and cataracts. Early intervention to treat\\nmyopia is key so your Treehouse Eyes doctor can greatly reduce those risks for\\nyour child. 2\\\\. More Career Prospects: Some careers may require good vision\\nsuch as the military, aviation industry, surgeons and paramedics, or any\\nrescue team such as a firefighter or a lifeguard. By slowing down the\\nprogression of myopia, your child will have a larger range of opportunities\\nand won’t be held back by their myopia. 3\\\\. Lower healthcare costs: Treating\\nmyopia early might save your child higher vision care costs. Treatment of\\nother eye diseases can be expensive, so the earlier myopia is treated, the\\nless likely it could lead to an eye disease that is more serious. 4\\\\. Overall\\nImproved Quality of Life: People with myopia may experience day-to-day\\ndifficulties with things such as difficulties driving, playing sports, or\\nreading. Early intervention for myopia is key and can improve overall vision\\nmaking daily activities easier and more enjoyable.

October 12, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Astigmatism is a fairly\\ncommon eye condition: about one in three people suffer from this condition.\\nThe cornea (the clear outer surface of the eyes) of patients with astigmatism\\nis shaped more like a football instead of a perfectly round ball (which is the\\nideal shape for your eyes). This irregular curve bends light more in one\\ndirection and causes blurry vision. Fortunately, moderate astigmatism can be\\neasily corrected using toric contact lenses. How are toric lenses different\\nfrom normal contact lenses? Lumen Optometric, your trusted scleral\\noptometrist, elaborates on the key features of toric lenses below: How the\\nShape of Toric Lenses Is Different Normal contacts have are spherical-shaped\\nwhereas toric lenses are shaped like the side of a donut. Thanks to this\\nunique shape, toric lenses have different refractive powers that can correct\\nastigmatism. They also have a small weight in their edges make sure your\\ncontacts return to their proper alignment after you blink. (Whenever you\\nblink, the contacts on your eye rotate.) Why It’s Important That Your Toric\\nContacts Fit Well It’s important that your contacts fit properly, but it’s\\nespecially so for toric lenses. That’s because ill-fitting toric lenses that\\nslip easily won’t be able to improve the clarity of your vision. What Are the\\nDifferent Types of Toric Lenses? Toric lenses are either made of soft or hard\\n(also known as rigid gas permeable) lenses. Soft lenses are comfortable to\\nwear, but hard lenses—which are more likely to stay in place—tend to perform\\nbetter than soft lenses. However, it usually takes a longer time to adjust to\\nhard lenses. If you want to learn more about toric lenses as well as other\\ntreatment options, like neurolens treatment, for other vision conditions,\\nconsult your eye doctor.

If you have plans with your soon-to-be\\nspouse, know that you don’t have to ditch your spectacles, especially if they\\nare what makes you distinct in terms of personality. Here are some pieces of\\nadvice from Lumen Optometric to help you get the most out of the look on your\\nwedding day. Make Your Glasses a Statement Piece You won’t be hard-pressed to\\nfind a stylish set of frames nowadays. In addition to vision correction, they\\ncan help enhance your appearance, especially when you wear your wedding\\noutfit. If you are getting a new pair before your big day, be sure that you\\ntreat it like jewelry. In other words, it should complement your dress or\\nsuit. Schedule a Custom Fitting Don’t go for the first frames you see right\\nfrom the shelf. Schedule a custom fitting with your future spouse so you can\\nfind the perfect pair of eyeglasses that will match the style you’re looking\\nfor. Your eye exam doctor can help you choose which frames suit you best,\\ntaking note of the shape and other details of your face as a guide. You’ll\\nwant them to be of the perfect size and fit, so you can wear them from the\\nwedding ceremony at church to the reception venue. Minimize the Glare It’s one\\nthing to get the perfect frame size and style, but it’s also another thing to\\nget the best prescription possible for vision correction. Your current\\nprescription may no longer work for you, and your next visit to your eye\\ndoctor is essential for determining whether you need a new one. While you’re\\nat it, why not ask about anti-reflective options? Expect many photo ops at the\\nwedding march and the reception, so lenses with this feature are a must-have\\nfor your new specs. At Lumen Optometric, we want to make sure that you will\\nget the best pair of eyewear possible that fits this important occasion. Apart\\nfrom this, you can count on us to provide other exceptional eye care services,\\nincluding neurolens therapy and corneal reshaping.

September 30, 2021\\nby Lumen Optometric Ill-fitting contacts can cause a host of problems,\\nincluding sensitivity to light, dry eyes, and contact lens intolerance (a\\ncondition that causes pain whenever contacts are worn). That’s why it’s\\nimportant that your contacts fit your eyes properly. The problem is that some\\ndiseases and conditions can make contact lens fitting harder. Lumen\\nOptometric, your trusted scleral optometrist, gives an overview below: Dry eye\\n– The surface of your eye needs to stay moist. Without sufficient lubrication\\nand moisture, the surface of your eye becomes more vulnerable to inflammation.\\nWearing contacts can also exacerbate issues related to dry eyes. That’s\\nbecause the lack of lubrication increases the friction between the eyes and\\ncontacts, increasing discomfort for lens wearers. Using artificial tears can\\nhelp alleviate symptoms of dry eye. However, certain formulations work better\\nthan others. That’s why if you need dry eye treatment, it’s best to consult\\nyour local eye doctor. Keratoconus – This is a progressive disease that causes\\ncorneas (the outer layer at the front of your eye that’s responsible for\\nfocusing light) to become thinner and bulge outward into a cone shape. The\\ncornea’s irregular shape distorts a patient’s vision and makes fitting\\ncontacts harder. Does This Mean Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes Still\\nWear Contacts? Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes need to wear custom-\\nmolded scleral lenses, which are larger than gas permeable contact lenses.\\nThanks to their large size, they can cover the entire corneal surface. Since\\nscleral lenses rest on the less sensitive part of the sclera or the white\\nouter layer of the eye, patients with Keratoconus don’t usually experience\\ndiscomfort when using them. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of\\nprofessional eye care services, including scleral lens fitting and neurolens\\ntreatment services. Our proprietor Dr. Eric To is the only practice-owning\\noptometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the\\nScleral Lens Society. As such, you can rest easy knowing that our team has\\nundergone advanced training to provide the clearest and healthiest vision for\\nour patients.

May 10, 2021 by Lumen Optometric The drastic\\nincrease in the number of children diagnosed with myopia during the past\\ndecade is astonishing — but is it surprising? Not really. When you analyze the\\ncauses of myopia, it becomes clear why more and more children are becoming\\naffected by this progressive eye disease. What Is Myopia? Myopia, often\\nreferred to as nearsightedness, is an eye disease in which the eye elongates\\nmore than it should, causing light to be focused in front of the retina\\ninstead of on the retina’s surface. Essentially, your child’s eye is growing\\ntoo long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body,\\nnaturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in\\nearly adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development\\nwhere they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription\\ndue to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred\\ndistance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty\\nseeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors lead a child to develop\\nmyopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status.\\nGenetics A child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is\\nnearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances\\nincrease even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or\\nyour spouse are myopic. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all\\nover the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of\\ntheir day, whether reading a book, using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or\\nanother device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially\\nin excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and\\nprogression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration\\nof near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating\\nnovel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a\\nmagazine a few minutes at a time. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least\\n2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in\\nchildren. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day,\\nespecially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Other Risk Factors\\nAssociated with Myopia Height — taller children and adolescents have a higher\\nincidence of myopia than their shorter counterpartsEducation level — There is\\na higher incidence of myopia in people with advanced degrees, as well as\\nhigher parental education levels.Ethnicity — Individuals from Asian/Pacific\\nIslander communities are more at risk of developing myopia. If Your Child Has\\nMyopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously\\naffect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood\\nsignificantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and\\nconditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular\\ndegeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia can be effectively\\nmanaged to reduce the risk of future eye disease.

The Importance of Eye Safety at Home Eye safety at home is\\nessential for several reasons. For one, it helps prevent accidents and\\ninjuries that can lead to vision problems.

By being proactive and taking\\nnecessary precautions, you can reduce the risk of eye injuries and conditions\\nthat may have a lasting impact on your visual health. Maintaining Your Eye\\nHealth at Home Paying attention to your eye health is essential for preserving\\nyour vision and preventing eye-related problems. Here are some tips to\\nmaintain healthy eyes.

June 14, 2022 by Lumen Optometric An annual eye exam is one of the best\\nways to keep your eyes healthy. Since you’ll only be seeing your eye doctor\\nonce a year, you need to make the most of it. That includes asking the\\nimportant questions pertaining to the current state of your eyesight. Lumen\\nOptometric lists some of them below. “Are My Eyes Healthy?” If your doctor\\ndetects a disease during the eye exam such as age-related macular degeneration\\nor glaucoma, they will educate you thoroughly and advise you how to safeguard\\nyour eyes. However, even if you haven’t been diagnosed with such, it’s best to\\nprioritize your wellness, especially when it comes to your vision. Be sure to\\nask your doctor if there are ways to improve your vision and ocular health.\\nThey will be able to present you with options to retain your healthy eyesight.\\n“Are There Any Changes I Should Do to Protect My Eyes?” Several eye diseases\\nhave been linked to UV exposure, from cataracts to eye cancers. Sunglasses can\\nprevent these issues, but your eye doctor may recommend UV-blocking contact\\nlenses to block the peripheral light that sunglasses cannot block. If you are\\nalready wearing a contact lens, you can replace your lenses as prescribed by\\nyour doctor. “Are Digital Devices Affecting My Eyesight?” More than 83% of\\nAmericans use digital devices for more than two hours each day, which can lead\\nto digital eye strain. Common symptoms include eye strain, headaches, blurred\\nvision, and dry eyes. During the eye exam, your eye doctor can suggest several\\ntips to alleviate digital eye strain. These may include offering dry eye\\ntreatment, changing the lighting and display settings, or wearing specialized\\nprescriptions, including contact lenses. “When Should I Return for My Next\\nVisit?” Depending on your age, vision, and medical history, your eye doctor\\nwill determine how often you need an exam. Staying on schedule is crucial,\\nespecially if you have underlying eye conditions that need to be treated. Most\\neye care centers may schedule your next appointment right away. Otherwise, be\\nsure to set a reminder on your phone. Here at Lumen Optometric, our eye care\\nprofessionals are happy to assist you with your eye health concerns.

Children frequently experience myopia progression, which lowers\\ntheir quality of life and increases risks to their eye health. Myopia control\\ntreatments are now able to improve children’s vision and promote long-term eye\\nhealth. Read on to find out more! What is Myopia? People with myopia have\\nblurred vision when looking at objects from a distance. When myopia worsens,\\nthe blur can become noticeable even when the object is close to or at arm’s\\nlength. Near-sightedness or short-sightedness are other names for it. Myopia\\nusually begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 14 and generally becomes\\nprogressively worse every several months in children. It results from the\\neyes’ rapid and excessive expansion relative to the usual pace of eye growth.\\nThe eyes should continue to expand consistently in size until adolescence,\\nthen stabilize. However, with myopia, the eyes develop too quickly, causing\\nrapid and continuous vision loss as well as ongoing eye growth into\\nadolescence and even early adulthood. Myopia progression is the term used to\\ndescribe this continuing deterioration. What is Myopia Control? The use of\\ntreatments intended to stop the advancement of myopia is known as “myopia\\ncontrol.” These treatments include atropine eye drops, soft contact lenses,\\northo-k, and special types of glasses. Myopia control is especially crucial\\nfor children, as it is in this age group that myopia is most likely to\\nprogress or worsen quickly. Both myopia management and myopia control are\\nphrases used to refer to the additional clinical care needed for myopic\\nchildren and adults. Myopia control typically entails using eye drops,\\ncontacts, or glasses to stop the progression of myopia. Myopia control is a\\nbroad term that encompasses maintaining eye health as well as various\\nlifestyle and environmental factors that may contribute to the advancement of\\nmyopia. What are The Advantages of Myopia Control? The primary advantage of\\ntreating myopia is to reduce the risks associated with high myopia. Those with\\nhigh degrees of myopia will have increased risk for diseases such as glaucoma,\\nretinal detachments, and myopic maculopathy. Myopia requires the use of\\nspectacles or contact lenses to treat blurry distance vision. If your myopia\\nis lower, you will be more functional in the mornings before putting on your\\ncontacts or glasses. You’ll be able to work a little better without them as\\nopposed to becoming totally incapacitated without them. Additionally, a lower\\nprescription increases the likelihood that your child will be a good candidate\\nfor laser eye surgery as an adult to correct their myopia, as well as the\\nlikelihood that they will have better visual results after surgery. What Else\\nShould I know? Numerous studies have demonstrated that a child’s or teen’s\\nvisual environment can raise their chances of developing and progressing\\nmyopia. When creating the visual environment, do increase the duration of\\noutdoor time your child has. Talk to your eye doctor or optometrist about the\\nideal duration they should spend outdoors and on screens and/or reading to\\ncontrol your child’s myopia. These can play a significant role in ensuring the\\noptimum results from myopia control treatments. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your\\nChild Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop\\npersonalized treatment plans for your child. Our treatment plans include\\nspecial prescription eye drops and customized daytime and overnight contact\\nlenses.

Always be careful when participating in activities that involve\\nsharp items and flying objects. One way to ensure your eyes are safe while\\nyou’re playing sports is wearing the proper safety eyewear. Keep in mind that\\nconventional glasses won’t give your eyes the protection they need. A local\\neye exam doctor shares facts about sports eye safety. Blinding Injuries Can\\nOccur From Combat Sports People participating in boxing and full-contact\\nmartial arts are at significant risk of severe eye injuries that can lead to\\nblindness. While there’s no standard eye protection for boxing, using\\nthumbless gloves can help reduce eye injuries related to the sport. Basketball\\nIs the Leading Cause of Sports-Related Injuries Most sports-related eye\\ninjuries in the U.S. occur while playing basketball. It is followed by\\nsoftball, baseball, airsoft rifles, pellet guns, racquetball and hockey. When\\nplaying these sports, you must wear protective glasses with shatterproof,\\npolycarbonate lenses. It pays to invest in protective eyewear that meets the\\nAmerican Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. At Lumen\\nOptometric, we’re here to help choose which glasses or contact lenses are most\\nsuitable for your activity. Consider Your Risks If one of your eyes already\\nhas reduced vision, think hard before participating in a sport with a high\\nrisk of eye injury. Are you willing to risk your other eye? Consult your eye\\ndoctor to find out what kind of eye protection you need. They might also\\nadvise or discourage you from playing high-risk sports, depending on the\\ncondition of your eyes. Let Lumen Optometric assist with your vision and eye\\nhealth needs. We offer eyeglasses, neurolens therapy, corneal reshaping\\ntreatment and more!

This is especially bad when the person\\nhas ocular misalignment, allowing for a condition termed trigeminal dysphoria.\\nThe premier corneal reshaping specialist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares\\nmore details about trigeminal dysphoria and how you can alleviate its\\nsymptoms. Who is At-Risk of Trigeminal Dysphoria? People who experience\\ntrigeminal dysphoria–about 90% of them, in fact, according to studies–have\\nocular misalignment when viewing nearby objects instead of at a distance. This\\nmeans their regular and continued use of digital devices becomes even more\\nproblematic since the task involves full-on near vision. To compensate for\\nthis problem, their vision must work overtime. This, in turn, puts a strain on\\nthe trigeminal nerve–the largest and most complex nerve connected to the\\nbrain. When the trigeminal nerve is triggered, these allow for symptoms that\\ninclude headaches, eye strain, light sensitivity, and neck and shoulder pain.\\nHow Do You Confirm You Have Trigeminal Dysphoria? The symptoms mentioned above\\nare also associated with a number of eye conditions. To determine whether you\\nactually have trigeminal dysphoria, you should visit a trusted local eye exam\\ndoctor like Lumen Optometric. Our trained and skilled eye care specialists\\nwill perform a comprehensive checkup of your eyes and accurately determine the\\nroot of its problem. If the results are indeed trigeminal dysphoria, we can\\noffer a safe and effective way to alleviate its symptoms. What is Neurolens\\nTreatment Technology? Lumen Optometric is the only neurolens treatment\\nprovider in the San Gabriel Valley. With the use of advanced and customized\\nlenses, we can correct your specific ocular misalignment so you won’t have to\\nstruggle to see up close or far away. This means a reduced potential for\\nsymptoms involved with trigeminal dysphoria, allowing only for the most\\ncomfortable vision possible. Neurolens utilizes different technology to\\nconventional contact lenses. To ensure you get the specialized lenses that can\\nperfectly fit your eyes and help with your specific symptoms, Lumen Optometric\\nwill measure your eye misalignment using sophisticated equipment, SightSync.\\nYou’ll start noticing vision improvements with neuronlens within the\\nweek–those with extremely chronic conditions, however, may require at least\\nsix weeks before they can see the difference. Lumen Optometric is your go-to\\nspecialist for safe and effective alleviation of trigeminal dysphoria\\nsymptoms. We proudly serve Sierra Madre, CA and the rest of San Gabriel\\nValley.

October 12, 2023 by Lumen Optometric\\nHave you ever asked, “Why are my eyes so dry?” Turns out, this is not an\\nuncommon issue, and many face it, especially in this digital age. There could\\nbe multiple reasons, from environmental factors to something more serious.\\nRead on to learn more about dry eyes, including the main causes and treatment\\noptions. Main Causes of Dry Eyes Several factors can contribute to dry eyes:\\nAging. With age, our tear production naturally decreases. This is why people\\nover 50 are more likely to experience dry eye symptoms. Gender. Hormonal\\nchanges, particularly during pregnancy, using oral contraceptives or\\nmenopause, can cause dry eyes in women. Environmental Conditions. Dry, windy,\\nsmoky or dusty conditions can increase tear evaporation. Also, spending long\\nhours looking at the computer screen can reduce the blink rate, drying your\\neyes out. Medications. Certain drugs, including antihistamines, decongestants,\\nblood pressure medications and antidepressants, can reduce tear production.\\nHealth Conditions. Certain health issues can cause dry eyes, such as Sjogren’s\\nsyndrome, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid problems. How to Treat\\nDry Eyes Treatment for dry eyes typically aims at restoring or maintaining the\\nnormal amount of tears in the eye to minimize dryness and related discomfort.\\nHere are some of the most common: Artificial Tears. Over-the-counter eye drops\\nthat mimic your natural tears may relieve mild cases of dry eyes. Lifestyle\\nChanges. Taking breaks during long tasks, avoiding air blowing in your eyes\\nand adding moisture to the air at home or work can help. Prescription\\nMedications. Certain prescription drugs can help increase tear production.\\nSpecial Procedures. In severe cases, various procedures can be used, like\\nclosing your tear ducts to reduce tear loss or using special contact lenses.\\nIf you’ve tried home care methods and over-the-counter solutions without\\nsuccess, it’s time to see a doctor. Seek immediate medical attention if you\\nhave: Unbearable eye discomfort A significant decrease in vision Other\\nsymptoms like redness, swelling or discharge Dry Eye Treatment at Lumen\\nOptometric At Lumen Optometric, we understand that every individual is unique.\\nHence, our treatments for dry eye syndrome are personalized to cater to your\\nneeds.

August 3, 2021 by Lumen Optometric People who get new eyeglasses can\\nsometimes experience discomfort. Some get nose pain and marks, while others\\nfeel eye strain or ear pain. To avoid these issues when getting new glasses or\\ncontact lenses, it is important to work with a reliable eye care professional.\\nHere are possible reasons your new eyeglasses might be uncomfortable to wear.\\nYour Eyeglasses Are Loose If your eyeglasses feel like they are falling every\\ntime you move, it could be that they are too loose around your ears. You can\\ntry to run your glasses under warm water and slightly bend the temple arms\\ndown. Another solution is to get eyeglasses in smaller frames that best fit\\nyour face shape. You Have a Low Nose Bridge You may have a low nose bridge if\\nyour eyeglasses slip down when you tilt your head. If this is the case, you\\nmay need the help of your eye exam doctor to find glasses that are suitable\\nfor lower nose bridges. They may suggest getting rectangular or horn-rimmed\\nglasses. Moreover, you can also try adjusting the nose pads of your glasses\\ninward, so they sit more securely to your nose. Your Glasses Are Not Set\\nCorrectly When glasses leave marks on your nose bridge, it could be that they\\nare not set correctly. It is easy to adjust the nose pads of your glasses, so\\nthey sit on your nose properly. Your optician may also adjust them or change\\nthem with another material, such as silicone, acetate, or nylon. If you have a\\nplastic frame, it’s possible that they are too heavy or the bridge may not be\\nbig enough. You may want to consider investing in eyeglass frames with a wider\\nbridge or lighter-weight lenses. Incorrect Pupillary Distance Measurement You\\nmay still get headaches from properly sized eyeglasses if it has an incorrect\\npupillary distance (PD) measurement. PD refers to the distance between your\\npupils and is necessary for eyeglass wear comfort. Mistakes on PD are common\\nfor people who get their prescription glasses. Lumen Optometric is here to\\nassist with your eye care needs. Besides glasses and contacts, we also offer\\nneuro lens and corneal reshaping therapy.

Usually, you won’t notice\\nsignificant changes in your vision until your 40s. It isn’t uncommon for older\\nadults to experience difficulty in reading small print or need more light to\\nsee clearly. Learn why it happens from a local orthokeratology specialist.\\nAging Eyes: Why Do They Need More Light? In your 40s, the lenses of your eyes\\ncan start to turn yellow and get more rigid. It can reduce the amount of light\\nthat enters your eyes and affect color accuracy and focus. As you age, your\\ncorneas can thicken and become more opaque. Your pupils can also begin to\\nshrink. These changes can further decrease and diffuse the light that reaches\\nyour eyes. Individuals who are 65 and older might need more light to see\\nclearly. Their eyes might take longer to adjust from light to dark\\nenvironments and vice versa. It can be more challenging for older adults to\\nfocus on nearby objects. They can also experience sensitivity to glare. Tips\\nto Help You Adjust to Vision Changes See Your Eye Doctor Regularly Regardless\\nof age, you must see an eye exam doctor regularly. Doing so helps in detecting\\nand treating vision-threatening conditions in their early stages. Macular\\ndegeneration, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the most common eye problems\\nin older adults. They don’t usually show early signs, and you might not know\\nyou have them until they have progressed. Make Necessary Changes to Your Home\\nPeople who are 65 and older often need twice as much light as young adults to\\nsee well. You can make your living space safer by increasing ambient light.\\nConsider adding dimmer switches so each family member can easily adjust the\\nroom’s illumination depending on their needs. Place task lighting wherever\\nthey are necessary. It’s also essential that light switches are easy to\\naccess. Don’t wait for your vision to change before seeing an eye doctor.

As another year unfolds,\\npeople usually start listing habits they want to begin and ones they wish to\\nquit. In your New Year’s resolutions, it would be great if you could include\\nthings that can help with your vision and eye health. For instance, seeing an\\neye exam doctor regularly. Here’s what you can include in your vision and eye\\nhealth resolutions for 2022. Reducing Screen Time Today, people spend more\\ntime on screens than ever before. However, excessive screen time can be\\ndetrimental to your eyes. It can increase your risk of developing dry eye\\nsyndrome, a condition that can cause your eyes to become red, dry, and itchy.\\nIf you have a job that requires you to use the computer for hours, make sure\\nto give your eyes a break every once in a while. Practice Healthy Contact Lens\\nWear Contact lenses are a great option for people who don’t prefer to wear\\nglasses. Using contacts is safe as long you practice good hygiene, wear them\\nproperly, and follow your eye doctor’s recommendations. You should avoid\\nwearing contacts for extended periods, reusing old solution, and handling\\nlenses without washing your hands. Avoid Constant Eye Rubbing While it may be\\ntempting to rub your eyes when they are itchy, you shouldn’t. Doing so will\\nonly worsen the problem and put too much pressure on your eyes or even scratch\\nthem. You can use a cold compress if your eyes keep itching. If it feels like\\nthere’s something inside your eye, gently flush it with water. However, if the\\nsensation persists, it’s best to see your eye doctor. Wear Proper Eye\\nProtection The sun’s ultraviolet rays can be extremely harmful to your eyes.\\nWhen going outside, make sure to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Moreover, use\\nprotective eyewear when swimming, cooking with oil, doing home improvements,\\nand other activities that risk eye injuries or involve chemicals. For your eye\\ncare needs, Lumen Optometric is more than happy to help. We specialize in\\nmyopia treatment, corneal reshaping therapy, and more!

Prolonged screen time can overwork your\\neyes and lead to eye strain, but the good news is that there are simple\\nexercises that can help relax and refresh your eyes. Lumen Optometric, your\\ngo-to provider of orthokeratology and other eye care solutions, shares five\\nexercises that are specifically designed to minimize eye discomfort. Eye\\nStrain Explained Also known as asthenopia, eye strain is a common condition\\ncharacterized by discomfort in and around the eyes. These are often caused by\\nactivities requiring intense use of the eyes, such as reading, driving, or\\nscreen time, and the usual symptoms include dryness, redness, blurred vision,\\nlight sensitivity, and headaches. When you constantly fix your gaze on digital\\nscreens, your eyes have to incessantly focus and refocus, causing eye strain.\\nExercises To Prevent Eye Strain The following simple exercises can\\nsignificantly reduce eye strain when incorporated into your daily routine: The\\n20-20-20 Rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something\\n20 feet away. This technique allows your eyes to rest from the intensity of\\nthe computer or smartphone screen. Blinking. This refreshes and moistens your\\neyes, which can prevent dryness and irritation. Palming. Rub your palms\\ntogether to warm them, then place them gently over your closed eyes. Feel your\\neyes relax while you breathe deeply. Eye-Rolling. Close your eyes and roll\\nthem gently in a circular motion. This helps to relieve tension around the\\neyes. Focusing Exercises. Hold your thumb six inches away from your face and\\nfocus on it for five seconds. Then, focus on an object 20 feet away for\\nanother five seconds. Switch back and forth. This exercise helps train your\\neyes. The Importance of Professional Eye Care While these eye exercises can\\nhelp prevent eye strain, it’s equally important to have regular, comprehensive\\neye checks done by an eye exam doctor. These exams will help in the early\\nidentification of any potential eye-related issues. Let Lumen Optometric Take\\nCare of Your Vision Eye strain is a widespread issue, but the good news is\\nthat it can be managed effectively through regular exercises and professional\\neye care. For top-notch eye care solutions, turn to the best in Sierra Madre,\\nCalifornia. At Lumen Optometric, we’ve got you covered, from orthokeratology\\nto top-quality contact lenses. We invite you to visit us in our clinic to\\nensure you maintain excellent eye health. Call us today at (626) 921-0199, or\\nvisit our website to schedule an appointment.

Unfortunately, it also brings\\nfactors that can affect your eye health and vision. Understanding these\\nfactors can help you protect your eyesight and enjoy all winter offers without\\nworry or discomfort. Complications of Cold Weather on Eye Health During colder\\ntemperatures, your eyes may suffer several complications that warrant an eye\\nexam. Dry Eyes: The cold weather often reduces the amount of moisture in the\\nair, resulting in dry eyes for many people. Due to reduced humidity levels\\ninside homes or offices and increased wind speeds, it can be difficult for\\ntears to form normally. This can lead to irritation, redness, itching and\\nburning sensations around the eyes that may cause further complications if\\nleft untreated. Wind and Dust: During colder temperatures, wind gusts are much\\nstronger than usual, which increases dust particles being blown into our eyes.\\nThis can cause irritation and potential damage to sensitive structures within\\nour ocular areas, such as the conjunctiva (the white part) or cornea (the\\nclear front layer). Sun Glare: With sun glare reflecting off ice crystals in\\nthe sky combined with strong winds blowing snowflakes across areas where there\\nshould be little obstruction from sunlight, there is an increased risk for UV\\nexposure. This can cause temporary issues such as headaches and long-term\\ndamage, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), over prolonged\\nperiods if protection isn’t taken seriously. Prevention Tips for Eye Health in\\nWinter Here’s what you can do to protect your eyes from the cold: Wear\\nProtective Eyewear: Wearing protective eyewear will help reduce exposure\\nlevels significantly while allowing us to see better under harsh conditions.\\nProtective eyewear contains polarized lenses providing clearer images even\\nwhen light reflects off surfaces like bodies of water or icy grounds. We\\nrecommend investing in quality frames/lenses designed against UV radiation to\\nkeep your vision intact. Hydrate: We suggest drinking plenty of fluids\\nthroughout days spent outdoors this season, not only because staying hydrated\\nhelps fight dryness caused by winds but also because a lack thereof could lead\\nto negative impacts. Take Breaks from Screens: Staring at screens for\\nprolonged periods can cause eyestrain and fatigue, leading to redness,\\nitchiness, dry eyes and other complications. Taking regular breaks from any\\ndigital device, especially when wearing contact lenses, helps give your eyes a\\nbreak so they can rest and recuperate more effectively. Eat Nutritious Foods:\\nEating nutritious foods rich in vitamins and minerals, such as dark leafy\\ngreens, sweet potatoes and oily fish, is important because these substances\\ncan help strengthen eye structures against external factors like dryness and\\nwind. They provide nutrients that benefit long-term vision health, reducing\\nrisks associated with certain conditions, including AMD (age-related macular\\ndegeneration) and cataracts. Visit an eye exam doctor: If you are experiencing\\nany of the symptoms mentioned above or if you have any questions about how to\\nprotect your eyes during winter, consult an eye doctor.

Nevertheless, many people are unaware that October\\nis also Halloween Eye Health and Safety Month, a wonderful time to highlight\\nthe need to protect your vision during this festive season. At Treehouse Eyes,\\nwe believe in preserving your child’s eyesight all year round, ensuring better\\nvision for life. In this blog post, we’ll explore some simple yet effective\\nways to protect your eyes and ensure a safe and enjoyable Halloween\\ncelebration. Choose the Right Costume Accessories: One of the most fun\\nelements of Halloween is dressing up in unique costumes. Yet, certain costume\\naccessories might be hazardous to your eyes. While choosing masks, headgear,\\nand other accessories, use caution. Check that they fit comfortably and do not\\nblock your view. Be sure to try and use outfits with transparent, non-toxic\\nface paint or cosmetics. Beware of Decorative Contact Lenses: Colored or\\ndecorative contact lenses are a popular choice for enhancing Halloween\\ncostumes, but they can be dangerous if not worn properly.

January 11, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Regular eye exams are an important\\npart of a child’s healthcare. Pediatric eye exams can detect vision problems\\nearly and help children develop the skills they need to succeed in school and\\nbeyond. A scleral optometrist discusses the ideal schedule for pediatric eye\\nexams here. What Is a Pediatric Eye Exam? A pediatric eye exam is a\\ncomprehensive assessment of your child’s eyesight. During the appointment, an\\noptometrist will evaluate how well your child can see from near and far\\ndistances, their peripheral vision and depth perception, and any underlying\\nconditions or diseases that could affect their vision. How Often Should\\nPediatric Eye Exams Be Scheduled? The American Optometric Association (AOA)\\nrecommends that all children receive comprehensive pediatric eye examinations\\nat least once between the ages of 3 to 5 years old, followed by yearly\\ncheckups until age 18 (or 21 if still in school). However, certain risk\\nfactors may increase the frequency with which these appointments should occur.\\nIssues such as premature birth or family history of ocular diseases, like\\nglaucoma, cataracts, retinopathy, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, strabismus\\n(crossed-eyes) and uncorrected refractive error, may make your child prone to\\ncertain eye health problems. Even dry eye, a natural part of aging, affect\\nchildren and require them to undergo dry eye treatment. In these cases, it’s\\nbest to consult your optometrist, who will create an individualized plan based\\non your needs and risk factors in your family history and medical records.\\nWhat To Expect During An Eye Exam When you bring your little one for an eye\\nexam, the doctor will conduct various tests to assess their eyes’ health and\\nfunction. These tests may include: Visual acuity test – This measures how your\\nchild can see at different distances. Refraction test – An examination to\\ndetermine whether corrective lenses are needed for optimal vision. Color\\nblindness test – A simple screening tool that checks for color deficiencies.\\nSlit lamp exam – Used to check for any signs of infection or damage on the\\neye’s surface. Retinoscopy/autorefractor – A method doctors use to measure\\nrefractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. If\\nyou’re looking for a comprehensive pediatric eye exam in Sierra Madre, CA,\\nlook no further than Lumen Optometric. Our team of experienced optometrists\\nwill work with you to ensure that your child’s vision is healthy and they’re\\nseeing their best.

If\\nso, they might be experiencing a common vision problem known as myopia or\\nnearsightedness. Alarmingly, studies show that childhood myopia rates are on\\nthe rise globally. Read on as Lumen Optometric shares crucial insights into\\nthis escalating issue, its impact on children’s vision, and how early\\ndetection and treatment can make all the difference. Understanding Myopia\\nMyopia, often known as nearsightedness, is a condition where objects up close\\nare seen clearly, while objects farther away appear blurred. Usually\\ndeveloping in childhood, myopia occurs when the eye grows too long, preventing\\nlight from focusing directly on the retina. This irregularity causes distant\\nobjects to appear blurry, which could mean your child is struggling to see the\\nschool board or having difficulty playing sports. How an Eye Exam Doctor Can\\nHelp Detect Myopia An eye exam doctor plays a critical role in the early\\ndetection of myopia. During your child’s regular eye exams, they can\\naccurately measure your child’s vision and eye health, diagnosing myopia and\\nother potential vision problems. Remember, early intervention can prevent your\\nchild’s eyesight issues from worsening. Treatment Options for Childhood Myopia\\nOnce diagnosed, effective treatment options are available. One common approach\\nis to prescribe contact lenses. These are usually worn during the day and\\nremoved at night, aiding in clear distant vision. Another advanced treatment\\noption is orthokeratology, a non-surgical procedure that gradually reshapes\\nthe eye’s curvature using specially designed contact lenses. One advantage of\\nthis process is that it slows down the progression of myopia in children,\\nproviding a more long-term solution. How Lumen Optometric Can Help At Lumen\\nOptometric, we’re dedicated to providing comprehensive eye care for your\\nchild. Based in Sierra Madre, CA, our team of eye doctors has the expertise to\\ndiagnose and treat myopia in children.

Eye safety hazards during sports can range from\\nminor scratches to severe trauma that can cause permanent vision loss.\\nChoosing the right sports eye safety gear is crucial to protect your eyes from\\npotential harm. In this article, we explore the different types of sports eye\\nsafety gear available and how to choose the right one for your needs.\\nIdentifying Your Needs When choosing the right sports eyewear, it is important\\nto consider the type of sport you are playing and the level of intensity. For\\ninstance, you may need different protection for a non-contact or low-intensity\\nsport like golf than for a full-contact team sport like football. Choosing the\\nappropriate eye protection will help protect your eyes while allowing you to\\nplay comfortably and safely. Features to Consider When selecting the right\\nsports eye safety gear, these are the features you should consider. Fit\\nRegardless of the type of activity you’re participating in, your eye doctor\\nwill recommend choosing eyewear that fits. Your eye gear should fit snugly and\\ncomfortably without slipping or moving during activity. Look for eyewear with\\nadjustable straps or nose pads to ensure a proper fit. Comfort Your eyewear\\nshould also be comfortable to wear for extended periods. Look for soft padding\\nor cushioning around the eyes. Lightweight materials that won’t bother you\\nduring activity are also excellent choices. Durability Sports eye safety gear\\nshould withstand impact and other potential hazards. Look for durable\\nmaterials that can withstand rough handling. Polycarbonate lenses or frames\\nmade from strong plastics or metals work great for this purpose. Visibility\\nChoose sports eye safety gear that doesn’t impede your vision. It should also\\nprovide you with a wide field of vision and have anti-fog coatings, so you can\\nsee clearly during activity. Additionally, it may be worth investing in\\nimpact-resistant lenses if you play contact sports. They absorb shock better\\nthan regular ones but still provide clear visibility even under extreme\\nconditions. Lens Tint The tint of the lens is also an important consideration\\nas it can affect your vision in different lighting conditions. Clear lenses\\nsuit low-light conditions, while tinted or polarized lenses can reduce glare\\nand improve visibility in bright sunlight. Shopping Tips Once you have\\nidentified your needs, research different brands and read customer reviews to\\ncompare features and quality. It is also worth asking for recommendations from\\nfriends or family who play the same sport. If you’re looking for eye exam\\ndoctors or orthokeratology or optometry specialists in Sierra Madre, CA, to\\nhelp you pick the right eyewear for your preferred sport, Lumen Optometric can\\nhelp.

October\\n26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is an\\nincredibly prevalent vision condition, affecting around 30% of Americans, with\\nan estimated 20-25 million children untreated in the United States alone. It\\ndevelops when the eyeball grows longer from front to back than normal, with\\nthe symptom of blurry distance vision. Myopia tends to begin in childhood and\\nworsen over time. This leads many to wonder – is nearsightedness genetic?\\nLet’s explore the evidence surrounding myopia’s hereditary patterns. Research\\nShows a Strong Genetic Link Extensive research, including twin studies, family\\npatterns, and genetic mapping, provides compelling evidence that genetics play\\na significant role in myopia. While environmental factors can also influence\\nmyopia risk, the hereditary component cannot be ignored. Specific genetic\\nvariations affecting eye growth, development, and refraction have been\\nidentified that predispose people to nearsightedness. These genes often relate\\nto connective tissues, neurotransmitters, and intracellular signaling.\\nHowever, experts note there are likely numerous genes involved in determining\\nmyopia susceptibility and that environmental factors do play a role. Overall,\\nstudies show parents who are nearsighted have a greater chance of passing\\nmyopia on to their children. The odds also increase if both parents are\\nnearsighted. The precise risk depends on the severity of parental myopia as\\nwell as environmental exposures. Ethnic patterns also demonstrate a genetic\\nlink. Asian countries, for example, have a much higher rate of myopia than\\nEuropean countries or the United States. While genetics play a key role,\\nlifestyle and environmental factors fine-tune how these predispositions\\nmanifest. But the bottom line is clear – nearsightedness has a powerful\\nhereditary component overall. Myopia Progression in Children Since myopia most\\noften develops and worsens during childhood, this is the period when genetic\\nrisk is most influential. Children with one or more myopic parents need close\\nmonitoring as their eyes continue to grow and develop refractive errors. Rapid\\nmyopia progression is especially common between ages 8-15. This is a critical\\ntime when interventions can help safeguard a child’s eyesight and offset\\ninherited risks. Implementing myopia control techniques at younger ages\\nappears to have the greatest impact on slowing progression long-term. The\\ncomplex interplay between hereditary susceptibility and environmental\\nexposures determines if and when myopia manifests and progresses in children.\\nHowever, identifying and addressing genetic predispositions early helps\\npreserve vision potential. Warning Signs of Myopia Onset in Children For\\nchildren with a family history of nearsightedness, be vigilant about the\\nfollowing signs that may indicate myopia onset: Squinting or eye-rubbing\\nDifficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading/close work Headaches\\nafter visual tasks Sitting very close to the TV Tilting head or closing one\\neye Holding objects close to face Any appearance of nearsighted symptoms\\nwarrants a comprehensive eye exam to assess the child’s status. Long-Term\\nImpacts of High Myopia In addition to blurred distance vision, high degrees of\\nnearsightedness increase vulnerability for several blinding eye diseases later\\nin adulthood. These include: Retinal detachment and tears Open-angle glaucoma\\nMyopic maculopathy Advancing myopia also further elevates the risk of vision\\nloss from these ocular conditions. Catching and controlling early myopia\\ndevelopment can therefore help preserve long-term eye health and function. By\\nunderstanding the hereditary factors at play and monitoring children’s eyes\\nproactively, the impacts of myopia on visual and ocular health can be reduced\\nover a lifetime. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Compelling\\nresearch confirms that nearsightedness (myopia) is influenced by genetic\\nfactors. And while they’re not the only factor, children with one or more\\nmyopic parents, especially at high degrees, need thorough eye exams starting\\nat an early age to determine if they are developing refractive errors\\nindicating myopia onset. Through early detection and consistent treatment, the\\nprogression of inherited myopia risks can be significantly slowed. While\\ngenetic predispositions cannot be changed, being proactive allows for\\npreserving a child’s vision and safeguarding their eye health over time.\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment\\nplans for your child. Our treatment plans include special prescription eye\\ndrops and customized daytime and overnight contact lenses.

October 26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also\\nknown as myopia, is one of the most common vision conditions affecting\\napproximately 30+% of people in the United States. In fact, it is estimated\\nthat 20-25 million children have Myopia in the United States alone. With\\nnearsightedness, objects up close are seen clearly while distant objects\\nappear blurry or out of focus. This results when the eye grows too long from\\nfront to back measured by the axial length of the eye. The elongation of the\\neyeball causes light rays to focus incorrectly on the retina resulting in\\nblurry distance vision. While nearsightedness cannot be cured, there are\\nvarious options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia\\n(nearsightedness). What Causes Nearsightedness? Nearsightedness occurs when\\nthe eyeball grows longer than normal from front to back. This causes the light\\nentering the eye to focus in front of the retina rather than directly on it.\\nThis results in blurred distance vision, while near vision remains unaffected.\\nSeveral factors contribute to the risk of developing nearsightedness, such as:\\nGenetics – Research shows nearsightedness has a hereditary component. Children\\nare more likely to be nearsighted if one or both parents have the condition\\nvs. none. Frequent near work – Activities requiring prolonged close vision\\nlike reading and screen use may encourage eyesight to adapt towards\\nnearsightedness over time. Excessive screen time – Increased use of computers,\\nsmartphones, tablets, and other screens is linked to rising myopia rates,\\nespecially in childhood. Reduced Outdoor time – Some studies indicate lack of\\noutdoor exposure, natural sunlight, and vitamin D are associated with a\\ngreater incidence of nearsightedness. Urbanization – Populations living in\\nurban versus rural areas tend to have higher rates of myopia on average.\\nEthnicity – Individuals of Asian descent have a higher prevalence of\\nnearsightedness. Many Asian countries see nearsightedness (myopia) rates of\\nover 80%. Signs and Symptoms The primary symptom of nearsightedness is blurred\\ndistance vision. When looking at distant objects like road signs, movies,\\nwhiteboards, or presentations, it can be difficult to see when nearsighted.\\nThis forces the eyes to strain and overwork to bring images into focus. As a\\nresult, individuals with uncorrected nearsightedness may experience:\\nDifficulty seeing school classroom boards Squinting or leaning forward to see\\ndistant details such as the score of a game Headaches from excessive eye\\neffort Eye fatigue after close work Poor night vision or problems driving at\\nnight Typically, both eyes are affected, though not always to the same degree.\\nThe blurry distance vision worsens gradually over time in most cases. Impacts\\nof Uncorrected Nearsightedness Allowing nearsightedness (myopia) to remain\\nuntreated can lead to several problems for your child. Myopia usually\\nprogresses over time, resulting in greater blur and dependence on treatment or\\ncorrection as you age. Constant squinting and eye effort add to fatigue and\\ndiscomfort, and unclear vision makes reading and seeing whiteboards at school\\ndifficult. There is also evidence that myopia can have social implications,\\nsuch as extracurricular activities that require distance vision become\\nchallenging. Not to mention many career options that have vision requirements.\\nHowever, all these issues don’t compare to the increased risk of severe eye\\nconditions like Glaucoma, cataracts, and the potential for retinal\\ndetachments. The severity of nearsightedness (myopia) typically stabilizes by\\nadulthood. However, getting your child’s vision treated early provides\\nsignificant benefits for eye health, visual development, and quality of life.\\nTreatment Options for Nearsightedness While nearsightedness itself cannot be\\nreversed or cured, there are effective treatment options for slowing or\\nstopping the progression of myopia. The best option will depend on the\\nseverity of nearsightedness, lifestyle needs, age, and overall eye health of\\nyour child – all of which are taken into account when getting treatment with a\\nTreehouse Eyes provider. Overnight Contact Lenses – Specially designed contact\\nlenses are designed to be worn at night only, put in right before bed, and\\ntaken out in the morning. Called KIDS lenses, these custom contact lenses\\ngently and comfortably reshape the front surface of the eye during the night,\\nwith an effect that lasts all day. These lenses are customized for each child\\nto fit their eye and are designed to help reduce the progression of myopia.\\nDaytime Soft Contact Lenses – These customized contact lenses are designed to\\nbe placed on the eye in the morning and removed each night. They have a\\nspecial optical design to reduce the progression of myopia while providing\\nclear vision during the day. This treatment allows children to be free from\\nglasses all day while providing excellent comfort and vision for all their\\nactivities. Prescription Eye Drops – Another treatment alternative is a\\nprescription eye drop, formulated to a specific concentration known to reduce\\nthe progression of myopia.

Essentially, your\\nchild’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the\\nrest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body\\nstops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a\\nchild’s development where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a\\nhigher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom\\nof myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches,\\neyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors\\nlead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even\\nsocioeconomic status. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all\\nover the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of\\ntheir day, whether reading a book, or using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or\\nanother device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially\\nin excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and\\nprogression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration\\nof near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating\\nnovel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a\\nmagazine a few minutes at a time. Genetics A child is more likely to be myopic\\nif one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are\\nmyopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s\\nvision checked if you or your spouse are myopic. Not Enough Outdoor Time\\nSpending at least 2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the\\nonset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play\\nevery day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! What Can You\\nDo? The good news is there are many things you can do you help slow or stop\\nthe progression of myopia. Get Regular (annual or semi-annual) Eye Exams Even\\nif both parents aren’t myopic, it’s still recommended to get an annual eye\\nexam for your child. You can schedule a myopia consultation with a Treehouse\\nEyes provider near you. Many pediatricians are able to complete basic eye\\nexams – be sure to ask them to check for myopia! Encourage Breaks from\\nExcessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids are focusing their eyes on\\nnear objects for the majority of their day. Encouraging breaks from near work\\nsuch as reading and electronic devices will help your child’s eyes and give\\nthem a chance to get back outside as it warms up. Spend More Time in Natural\\nSunlight As you encourage your child to take a break from near work, one of\\nthe best ways to enjoy that newfound time is to get outside! Natural sunlight,\\neven in the classroom, can be protective of myopia. Be sure to wear some\\nsunblock as well! If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t\\nrealize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and\\nvision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of\\ndeveloping serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal\\ndetachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood. The good news is\\nthat myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye\\ndisease. You can prevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling\\nyour child’s myopia consultation with us today. Book your appointment by\\ncalling us at (626) 921-0199 or filling this out.

Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, resulting in\\nblurry distance vision and increased risks of serious, sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases, such as glaucoma1, cataract2, or retinal eye diseases3. An estimated\\n1 in 3 children in the U.S. have myopia and the prevalence has grown\\ndramatically over the last 30 years4. Research has shown lack of outdoor time\\nfor kids and more near work, like reading and time on screens, drive the\\nmassive increase we are seeing in myopia5-7. Myopia Progresses As Your Child\\nGrows Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the\\nschool-age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye\\ngrows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once\\nthe rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there\\nmay be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and\\nsuddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat\\nmyopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing\\nmyopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they\\nage. Natural Sunlight Can Help Myopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time\\nspent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has\\nled to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most\\nacute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s\\npopulation will be myopic by 2050. In fact, a recent study found that\\nincreased exposure to outdoor light reduces myopia development. There Are Now\\nTreatments for Myopia There is hope for parents is there are several\\ntreatments now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia\\nin children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or\\nprescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a\\nchild’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their\\neye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good\\ncandidate for treatment. You can prevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases\\nby scheduling your child’s myopia consultation with us today.

Myopia is an eye disease that occurs when the eye grows too\\nlong—like the shape of a football. This causes distant objects to appear\\nblurry and increases the risk of serious, sight-threatening eye diseases in\\nadulthood. As a parent, you want what’s best for your child. By learning these\\n5 important facts, you may feel encouraged to do more for your child’s eye\\nhealth and long-term vision—such as ensuring that they get their eyes checked\\non a regular basis and turning to myopia management to prevent the rapid\\nprogression of this disease. The COVID-19 Pandemic Has Increased Myopia\\nPrevalence In Children The significant reduction in outdoor time during the\\npandemic combined with the surge in screen time has increased the incidence of\\nmyopia cases. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in\\nOphthalmic Research (2020), outdoor time helps slow down the change of axial\\nlength and reduce the risk of myopia. Similar results were found in a previous\\nstudy in Ophthalmology (2013) that investigated the association between myopia\\nin children and adolescents, and the amount of time spent outdoors. The study\\nanalyzed over 10,000 children and adolescents aged 20 and under and concluded\\na substantial correlation between increased time spent outside and the\\nprevalence of myopia. Each additional hour spent outside per week was linked\\nto a 2% reduction in the risk of myopia. Myopia Increases the Risk of Eye\\nDisease Those with high myopia and rapidly progressing myopia in childhood are\\nmore prone to developing ocular comorbidities or serious sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases later in life, such as: GlaucomaMacular degenerationMyopic\\nMaculopathyRetinal detachment Myopia is a Progressive Eye Disease Myopia\\nusually starts in childhood and progresses throughout a child’s school years,\\neventually stabilizing around ages 18-22. Since the eye grows in sync with the\\nrest of the body, it’s only natural that it ceases elongating in early\\nadulthood when the rest of the body stops growing. This also means that a\\nchild’s growth spurts often coincide with a higher prescription. Fortunately,\\nmyopia can be efficiently treated in order to prevent it from worsening as the\\nchild grows. Slowing myopia early in life can make a significant difference in\\nyour child’s eye health in their present and future. Myopia Is An Epidemic\\nMyopia is a global epidemic that continues to worsen, affecting close to 2\\nbillion individuals worldwide. If current trends hold, roughly half of the\\nworld’s population will be myopic by the year 2050, partly due to genetics and\\nincreasingly as a result of our society’s preference for staying indoors and\\nspending more time on digital screens. Myopia Can Be Treated Myopia cannot be\\ncured; however, its progression can be slowed or even halted. The goal of\\nmyopia treatment, also known as myopia management or myopia control, is to\\nreduce or halt the eye’s rapid growth. Effective myopia treatment entails more\\nthan simply correcting a child’s blurry vision with glasses; it’s meant to\\nprevent a child’s vision from deteriorating and, thus lowering their risk of\\ndeveloping severe myopia-related eye diseases later in life.

It alters the shape and structure of the eye limiting its\\ncapability to focus on objects in the distance (blurry distance vision). If\\nyou have struggled with the condition before, your kids might also develop the\\ndisorder at some point in life. Myopia starts with signs small signs such as\\nsquinting, sitting too close to the TV, tablet, or book, and sometimes even\\nmanifests as headaches. Besides pain and discomfort, the onset of myopia can\\nhave a ruinous impact on the quality of your kid’s life. It can be hard to\\nread the board at school or perform well in extracurricular activities.\\nTherefore, it is imperative to diagnose and prevent myopia from worsening to\\nmore sight-threatening conditions. We have hand-picked practical ways you can\\nutilize in curbing the progression of myopia in children. Let Them Spend Time\\nOutdoors The bright and ambient light outdoors is linked to the modulation of\\ncorrect eye development. Spending time outdoors can help reprogram the eye\\nstructure to focus on distant objects. You should encourage your kid to spend\\nmore time outdoors especially if he or she has already been diagnosed with\\nmyopia. Quality outdoor time helps to preserve good eyesight in addition to\\ndelaying the onset or progression of nearsightedness. Ideally, children need a\\nminimum of 90+ minutes of quality time outdoors every day. Regular Eye Checks\\nare Crucial Myopia is a very treatable condition, particularly when detected\\nearly. That is why it is crucial to take your kid for an eye test at least\\nonce a year. The disorder might show very few signs in its early stages, which\\nis why establishing baseline measurements early is paramount. Additionally,\\nsome of its signs like headache and blurry vision can easily be confused for\\nother conditions. When left untreated, myopia will gradually progress\\nincreasing the likelihood of contracting other vision disorders like cataracts\\nor detached retinas. The only reliable manner to know if your kid is at risk\\nof nearsightedness is through a clinical eye test measuring the axial length\\nof the eye. If your eye doctor is not conducting this test, they are not\\nproviding you with the best measure of your child’s eye health. Limit Screen\\nTime Excessive screen time and continuous near work are the greatest non-\\ngenetic risk factors for nearsightedness. Activities such as computer use,\\ndrawing, and reading can cause a substantial amount of strain on the eye. If\\nyour children cannot avoid these activities entirely, it is advisable to limit\\nthe time they spend on them. Taking regular breaks helps the eye to relax and\\nis ideal for managing the nearsightedness condition. Try Soft-multifocal\\nLenses for Myopia Control We are still a few months or even years away from an\\nFDA-approved eyeglass for treating myopia. By wearing our Daytime Soft Contact\\nLenses, your child no longer has to depend on glasses to have clear vision\\nduring the daytime. We understand that at times, glasses can be an\\ninconvenience for activities like sports and other vigorous activities. As\\nsuch, our contact lenses not only allow your child to see clearly but also be\\nfree from the hassle of wearing glasses. In addition, our Daytime Soft Contact\\nLenses, like all our other products, are FDA-approved, ensuring safety and\\neffectiveness. Our doctors would also follow up in subsequent consultations to\\nensure that your child is doing well and that our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses\\nare comfortable for their eyes. Go for Atropine Eye Drops Atropine eye drops\\ncan help keep the progression of nearsightedness in check by curbing eyeball\\nelongation. The chemical agent also strengthens eyeball structures to prevent\\nunwarranted eye growth that might occur in adolescent years to trigger myopia.\\nAtropine eye drops are safe when used in proper amounts. You should always\\nfollow the eye doctor’s prescription when administering the chemical for\\neffective myopia modulation. Overnight Lenses Might Help Treehouse Eyes’\\nOvernight Contact Lenses are specially designed to be worn only in the evening\\nas your child goes to bed. As such, our Overnight Contact Lenses should be\\nworn during sleep and taken out in the morning before your child prepares for\\nthe day. Specifically called KIDS Lenses, these lenses are custom-made for\\neach child to gently and comfortably reshape the cornea, which is the clear\\nfront surface of the eye. It’s incredibly important to ensure that our\\nOvernight Contact Lenses are tailored to each child as everyone’s eye shape is\\ndifferent. If the lenses do not fit a particular eye shape, the eyes may get\\ninfected by a corneal abrasion. As such, at Treehouse Eyes, each child will\\nundergo a consultation to receive his or her very own lenses that are fitted\\nto their unique eye shape. Studies have shown that myopia progression can be\\nslowed dramatically and, in some cases, stopped through this treatment in\\nchildren. Conclusion Although it is impossible to cure myopia, the condition\\ncan be treated with several clinical methods including the use of daytime soft\\nlenses. A nearsightedness (or short-sightedness) diagnosis does not mean it is\\nover for your child. Instead, you should focus on managing the conditions with\\nthe right practices to contain its progression and slow or potentially stop\\nthe disease in its tracks.

That’s why it’s a good idea to examine your everyday\\nroutine and daily habits to ensure you aren’t inadvertently doing something\\nthat could hurt your eyes. In this article, your trusted scleral optometrist\\nfrom Lumen Optometric highlights some common habits that are bad for your\\neyes. Bad Habit #1: Not giving your eyes a break. Smart phones, laptops,\\ntablets,and other digital devices with LCD screens are a staple of almost\\neveryone’s daily lives. While looking at digital screens cannot always be\\navoided, spare yourself from digital eye strain by resting your eyes after\\nevery 20 minutes of screen time. Bad Habit #2: Using contact lenses\\nimproperly. If you’ve undergone any type of lenses treatment such as neurolens\\ntherapy and need to wear special lenses, it’s critical that you follow your\\neye doctor’s instructions when it comes to handling and caring for your\\nlenses. The same goes for standard contact lenses. Bad Habit #3: Rubbing your\\neyes. This habit might be a little harder to kick. It might feel gratifying to\\nrub your eyes, but rubbing your eyes too vigorously can cause the blood\\nvessels under your eyelids to break. Try a cold compress the next time your\\neyes feel irritated. Bad Habit #4: Not eating well. A well-balanced diet is\\ncrucial to keeping your eyes healthy. Choose foods rich in vitamins C and E,\\nas well as foods containing zinc and omega-3 fatty acids. You don’t have to\\ncook elaborate meals — just make sure you load up on citrus fruits, fish and\\nleafy greens. Lumen Optometric cares about your eye health.

The degree\\nof myopia varies and it happens to around 30% of children and teens. To remedy\\nthis, there are specific treatments called myopia control. But what exactly is\\nmyopia control? As your locally trusted scleral optometrist, we’re here to\\nhelp you understand what you need to know about myopia control. What Is Myopia\\nControl? “Myopia control” is the term to describe the methods used to prevent\\nthe progression of myopia. These measures are usually prescribed by an\\noptometrist or an ophthalmologist. They come in four primary treatments,\\nnamely: multifocal contact lenses, atropine eye drops, multifocal eyeglasses,\\nand orthokeratology. These treatments are important because they can help\\nreduce the risk of complications that lead to high myopia, such as cataracts,\\nretinal detachment, glaucoma and even blindness. Multifocal Contact Lenses\\nThese lenses are designed to provide clear vision for people who have\\nnearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and other refractive errors.\\nThese are also designed for people who are experiencing the normal age-related\\nloss of near focusing ability called presbyopia. Atropine Eye Drops This is a\\nkind of dry eye treatment that’s commonly used to reduce the pain associated\\nwith eye inflammation. It also gives relief from focusing fatigue by dilating\\nthe pupil to limit the eye’s ability to automatically change focus. Also\\ncalled accommodation, the effect it has by atropine eye drops can be counted\\nfor its effectiveness in reducing myopia progression in children. Multifocal\\nEyeglasses The eyeglasses work similarly to multifocal contact lenses, which\\nhelp wearers with presbyopia see clearly. This control treatment can also\\nmildly slow the progression of myopia in children. But some studies show that\\nthe progression slowed up to 51 percent in children compared to wearing normal\\nglasses for correction. Orthokeratology Orthokeratology, or Ortho-K, are\\nspecially designed gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight while sleeping\\nto help reshape the eye’s cornea. This slows down the progression of myopia as\\nwell as provides clearer vision during the daytime without the need for lenses\\nor glasses. Some studies found that children wearing ortho-k contact lenses\\nreduced the lengthening of the eyeball by almost 43 percent compared to\\nwearing regular eyeglasses for myopia correction. Whether you need myopia\\ncontrol or neurolens treatment, trust our team at Lumen Optometric to help you\\ndeal with your eye issues.

December 6, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Parents who are nearsighted\\noften wonder what can be done to prevent their children from developing the\\nsame or similar conditions. While scientists haven’t yet found a way to\\nguarantee that your child won’t develop myopia (often referred to as\\nnearsightedness), there are things you can do to delay its onset and even\\nprevent its progression. What is Myopia? Myopia is a progressive eye disease\\nthat causes the eye to grow longer than normal, altering its ability to\\ncorrectly focus light onto the retina. This results in blurred distance vision\\nthat can make it difficult for children to learn efficiently in the classroom\\nor take part in extracurricular activities. Myopia is often corrected with\\nprescription glasses or contact lenses, but these methods simply correct the\\nchild’s vision while allowing the condition to worsen. Why is it Important to\\nDelay or Slow Myopia Progression? The worse your child’s myopia gets, the\\nhigher their chance of developing sight-threatening diseases like glaucoma,\\nmacular degeneration and retinal detachment later in life. That’s why it’s\\nimportant to try and keep your child’s lens prescription low and controlled\\nusing the methods listed below. If your child doesn’t yet have myopia,\\nfollowing the same protocol will help prevent myopia onset for as long as\\npossible. Is it Possible To Prevent Myopia or Myopia Progression? While many\\nchildren inherit myopia from their parents, there are also several\\nenvironmental factors that can lead to the onset and progression of\\nnearsightedness. By making some lifestyle changes, it may be possible to delay\\nthe onset of myopia and prevent its progression. Boost Daily Outdoor Time\\nResearch shows that children of myopic parents who spend a lot of time\\noutdoors have lower rates of myopia than children who stay mostly indoors. A\\nrecent study published in Review of Optometry (2021) concluded that children\\nshould spend at least 2-3 hours per day engaged in outdoor activities to delay\\nthe onset of myopia, especially if a child has one myopic parent. Another\\nstudy published in Ophthalmic Research (2020) confirms the protective effect\\nof “sun time” against myopia onset. When observing the myopia rates of\\n6-12-year-olds, there were fewer new myopia cases in the group of children who\\nspent between 11-15 hours outdoors per week, compared with children who\\ndidn’t. The researchers also found that the myopia progression rate was slower\\nin the group of children who spent more time in the daylight. If you do add\\nsome extra outdoor time to your child’s daily routine, be sure to provide them\\nwith UV blocking sunglasses, sunscreen, a water bottle and other sun-safe\\ngear. Limit Screen Time Screen time is thought to have a greater impact on a\\nchild’s vision than other near work like reading a book, for a few reasons.\\nChildren are exposed to digital screens at a younger age than other forms of\\nnear work, and they tend to use screens for longer intervals of time.\\nAdditionally, the working distance between a child’s eyes and a digital screen\\ntends to be shorter than the distance between their eyes and a book or other\\nobject, to compensate for the small print size and images. An article\\npublished in Review of Myopia Management (2021) examines the results of\\nseveral scientific studies that analyze the relationship between screen time\\nand myopia. Two of these studies found that the risk of developing myopia was\\n8 times greater for children aged 5-15 who used a smartphone or video game for\\nmore than 2 hours a day, compared to children who have 0-2 hours of daily\\nscreen time. And while we don’t expect parents to ban all digital devices from\\ntheir homes, it is advisable to set daily limits on digital device usage. Try\\nto cap your child’s daily screen time at 2 hours. Children under the age of 2\\nshould have as little screen time as possible. Encourage Frequent Breaks From\\nNear Work Any sort of near work, like reading and writing, puts a strain on\\nyour child’s eyes and can contribute to myopia onset and progression. One way\\nto prevent myopia development in your child is to teach them to take breaks\\nfrom visually demanding activities. A 2008 study published in the journal of\\nInvestigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science found that the intensity of\\nnear work plays an important role in myopia development in schoolchildren.\\nAccording to the study, the duration of uninterrupted near work seems to be\\nmore significant than the overall time spent engaged in close-distance\\nactivities. Regular Myopia Eye Exams Whether or not your young child or teen\\nhas myopia, yearly eye exams with your optometrist are crucial to keeping\\ntheir vision healthy and clear. It’s important to note that vision screenings\\nin school are not enough to detect most visual problems, and certainly not for\\npreventing myopia. Tracking your child’s eyesight yearly will help determine\\nthe best treatment for preventing myopia onset and slowing or halting its\\nprogression.

While instances and awareness of\\nmyopia are on the rise, to help spread myopia awareness we’ve written out the\\nbasics on childhood myopia, why it matters, and what you as a parent can do to\\nhelp preserve your child’s eye health in the long run. What is Myopia? Myopia\\n(often referred to as nearsightedness) is the most common cause of impaired\\nvision in people under age 40, and its prevalence in children is growing at an\\nalarming rate. Myopia typically starts in childhood and progresses (the eye\\nkeeps getting bigger), or gets worse, until early adulthood. During this time\\nthe symptom of myopia, blurry distance vision, gets worse, meaning the patient\\nneeds stronger glasses to continue to see clearly. If blurry distance vision\\nis the symptom of myopia, what exactly is myopia? Stated again, myopia is an\\neye that is growing too long. How do we know this? We measure it using special\\nnon-invasive technology to calculate the length of the eye from the front\\n(cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length and\\nis measured down to fractions of a millimeter with advanced equipment. So,\\nmyopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye. Risk Factors for Myopia Myopia\\nrisk factors include genetics (having one or both parents myopic), an\\ninsufficient amount of time spent outdoors, and excessive near work (time\\nspent reading, school work, & digital screens). Childhood myopia is\\nprogressive, which is why your child may need a new prescription every year or\\ntwo. Unless treated, a child’s myopia will continue to worsen until early\\nadulthood. What some people don’t realize is that myopia is far more than\\nsimply blurred vision — it’s associated with drastically higher risk of\\ndeveloping eye disease in the future. How Can Myopia Impact a Child’s Health?\\nChildhood myopia places a child at a greater risk of developing serious eye\\ndiseases later in life, as compared to non-myopic children, and the odds only\\nincrease as myopia continues to progress. In fact, a child with myopia is 2 to\\n40 times more likely to develop myopic maculopathy (also known as myopic\\nmacular degeneration, a serious vision-threatening complication) depending on\\ntheir degree of nearsightedness. Retinal detachment is another serious eye\\ncondition that can cause permanent blindness. A myopic child is 3 to 21 times\\nmore likely to develop this emergency eye condition in adulthood. Moreover,\\nchildren with myopia have a threefold risk of developing glaucoma, a leading\\ncause of blindness worldwide, in the long run. And although cataracts are\\nconsidered a normal part of aging, having myopia advances the age at which\\nthey develop. According to a study published in JAMA Ophthalmology,\\nindividuals with high myopia are more likely to need cataract surgery at an\\nearlier age than those with no myopia. Furthermore, aside from an increased\\nrisk of adult eye disease, untreated myopia can prevent a child from\\nsucceeding academically and socially. A 2019 study published in the Community\\nEye Health Journal underscores the importance of excellent visual acuity in\\nschool-aged children. It found that offering vision correction to students\\nwith myopia has more of an educational impact than providing them with\\nvitamins or medications to maintain or improve their physical health. Myopia\\nhas equally serious ramifications outside the classroom. A study published in\\nBMC Ophthalmology (2016) found that adolescents with myopia are more likely to\\nhave anxiety than their peers with normal vision. Furthermore, adverse visual\\nsymptoms impact a child’s self-esteem, according to a study published in the\\nJournal of Optometry and Vision Science. The good news is that certain\\nlifestyle choices, especially when coupled with myopia management treatment,\\ncan have a lasting positive effect on your child’s eye health. What Can\\nParents Do To Help Slow Myopia Progression? We know that parents want what’s\\nbest for their children. So here are a few recommendations that will help keep\\nyour child’s eyes healthy — whether or not myopia has set in. Take your kids\\noutside to play. Several studies have indicated that children who spend over 2\\nhours outdoors during the day have lower levels of myopia and slower myopia\\nprogression. A recent study published in BMC Ophthalmology and cited in Review\\nof Optometry (2021) found that for non-myopic children with myopic parents, “a\\nhigh level of outdoor exposure had a remarkable influence on the risk of new\\nmyopia for children even with one myopic parent.” Although it’s not always\\neasy, try to limit the amount of continuous near work your child does. Whether\\nit’s reading or scrolling through a phone, remind your child to take breaks.\\nHowever, the most important thing you can do to protect your child’s long-term\\neye health is manage their myopia with treatment. We Can Help Preserve Your\\nChild’s Eye Health At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to provide expert care to\\neach and every child with kindness and a smile. Our state-of-the-art equipment\\nand diagnostic technology enable us to thoroughly assess your child’s visual\\ncondition and needs.

However, many children have undiagnosed vision issues that require early\\ndetection and intervention for the best outcomes. Why Early Detection Matters\\nCatching vision problems early in childhood is crucial. Early detection\\nensures children get the vision correction they need during critical\\ndevelopmental windows. Those children suffering from vision deficits can lead\\nto academic issues, behavioral problems, and even low self-esteem issues.\\nSigns Your Child May Need an Eye Exam There are several signs parents should\\nlook for that may indicate a child is struggling with their vision: Frequent\\nsquinting or rubbing of the eyes Sitting very close to the TV or holding\\ndevices close to the face Tilting the head to one side Covering one eye\\nDifficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading/close work Losing place\\nwhile reading Trouble differentiating colors Clumsiness or poor hand-eye\\ncoordination Headaches or eye pain after visual tasks If you observe any of\\nthese symptoms, schedule an eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist\\nwho specializes in pediatric patients. An exam can identify issues like\\nnearsightedness, farsightedness, lazy eye, convergence problems, and other\\ndisorders. Protecting Your Child’s Vision Health Along with regular eye exams,\\nthere are several ways parents can help maintain healthy eyesight: Ensure your\\nchild wears 100% UV-blocking sunglasses outside Limit screen time and take\\nfrequent breaks from ‘near-work’ Provide a nutritious diet with eye-healthy\\nvitamins Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure Following your eye\\ndoctor’s specialized treatment plan is also essential to managing any vision\\nconditions your child is diagnosed with. The Benefits of Annual Eye Exams\\nGetting your child’s eyes checked every year is a critical piece of preventive\\nhealthcare. At annual exams, optometrists and ophthalmologists thoroughly\\nevaluate vision acuity, eye alignment, and eye health. Treehouse Eyes\\noptometrists go a step further by measuring axial length to determine if\\nmyopia is present or not. This allows early detection of refractive errors\\nlike myopia (nearsightedness) as well as other eye disorders like amblyopia or\\nstrabismus, which require prompt treatment. Catching and addressing issues\\nearly improves outcomes and treats the issues rather than just correcting them\\nwith glasses. Annual exams also screen for eye diseases and conditions that\\nrarely show apparent symptoms in kids, like glaucoma. Preventing and\\ncontrolling these disorders protects long-term vision. Treehouse Eyes is proud\\nto join in Children’s Eye Health and Safety Month by helping educate families\\nabout protecting one of their child’s most precious gifts—the ability to see\\nthe world clearly. By scheduling comprehensive eye exams each year and\\nremaining vigilant for signs of vision issues, parents can ensure their\\nchild’s visual development stays on track. If you have any concerns about your\\nchild’s vision, consult a Treehouse Eyes doctor near you. Healthy eyes and\\nclear sight in childhood provide a lifetime of benefits. Let Treehouse Eyes\\nHelp Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to\\ndevelop personalized treatment plans for your child.

August 28, 2023 by Lumen Optometric The Complex\\nRelationship Between Eye Growth and Myopia Development The human eye is a\\nremarkably dynamic organ that undergoes natural growth and changes over a\\nlifetime. One key factor that significantly impacts eye development is myopia,\\nalso known as nearsightedness. Myopia occurs when the eyeball elongates (grows\\ntoo long) from front to back, causing light rays to focus incorrectly and\\ndistant objects to appear blurry. This eye growth is driven by a combination\\nof genetic and environmental factors. Research shows myopia is becoming more\\nprevalent globally, affecting around 30% of the world’s population, with an\\nestimated 50% by the year 2050. Theories for this increase include frequent\\nnear-work on digital devices/homework and less time outdoors early in life.\\nBoth can strain the visual system and put the eyes at risk for abnormal\\nelongation. When myopia develops, the implications go beyond the need for\\nvision correction. Excessive eye growth is linked to a higher risk of blinding\\nconditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment later in life.\\nMyopia also reduces the quality of life, at school, when playing sports,\\nparticipating in extracurriculars, and activities requiring distance vision\\nlike driving. So what proactive steps can be taken to support healthy eye\\ndevelopment and reduce the odds of myopia onset? The most important step you\\ncan take is to get your child a yearly eye exam. This ensures that their\\nvision is being monitored and tracked in case of issues like myopia. Below are\\na few other tips to help support your child’s eye health. Increase time\\noutdoors, especially in early childhood. Avoid chronic use of screens/mobile\\ndevices at young ages Maintain clear focus on distant objects through\\nactivities like sports Get regular eye exams to monitor for signs of abnormal\\ngrowth Eat a nutritious diet and nutrients that may support ocular health\\nUnderstand your genetic predispositions and family history The key is taking\\npreventive actions early. Though myopia itself cannot be reversed once\\nmanifested, slowing or even stopping the progression is possible. Implementing\\nhealthy lifestyle habits and frequent eye assessments allows for early\\nintervention against excessive eye growth in children. So… do your eyes grow?\\nYes. Just like all other parts of the body, your eyes grow as well. Where\\nissues occur is when the eyeball grows too long from front to back (a.k.a.\\nMyopia), resulting in blurred distance vision.

Myopia Symptoms and How To Treat December 2,\\n2022 by Lumen Optometric Treehouse Eyes is a specialty pediatric eye care\\npractice treating myopic children with a nationwide network of doctors.\\nRecently, doctors in our Treehouse Eyes community had the chance to spread the\\nword about myopia with local media coverage. Our doctors are passionate about\\nspreading awareness about the myopia epidemic and how early intervention can\\nmean a lot for your child’s eye health. Explore some of the topics our peers\\ncovered in recent interviews. How To Tell If Your Child Is Nearsighted It’s\\nnot always simple to detect whether or not your child is nearsighted. Watching\\nout for the common symptoms of myopia is key to determine whether or not your\\nchild needs treatment. Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Aimee Jacobs OD, discusses\\nsome signs to look out for. Dr. Jacobs explains, “If they’re having trouble\\nfocusing in school, if they can’t stay on task, if it seems like it might be a\\nbehavior issue, a lot of times it’s because they can’t see what they’re doing\\nor they can’t see what they’re doing well enough to focus on it.” Screen Time\\nAs a Risk Factor As screen time increases, so does the early onset of myopia.\\nTreehouse Eyes has observed a 30 percent increase in the number of myopic\\nchildren being treated since the pandemic began. Dr. Tiffany Martinez recalls\\nthe effects of the pandemic on children, “During the pandemic we saw a lot\\nmore kids they we saw become myopic than we did before.” This is due to the\\ndecreased time outdoors and increase in near work. Another Treehouse Eyes\\npartner, Dr. Ryan Stybel describes the effects of too much ‘near work’,\\n“Screen time or near work is causing myopia to start at an earlier age but\\nalso progress more rapidly.” He then goes on to explain the implications of\\nCOVID isolation, “We’re just getting through a pandemic, myopia is an epidemic\\nespecially with the increased screen time and virtual learning. Limiting\\nscreen time is a very important thing and taking frequent breaks and spending\\ntime outdoors. We recommend 90 minutes a day outdoors to use the natural\\nsunlight and looking at distance objects can be beneficial and help their eyes\\nfrom getting worse.” What To Look For As a Parent: Myopia is a treatable and\\npreventable disease, annual eye exams are highly recommended because often\\ntimes children are unable to articulate their symptoms to a parent. Dr. Denise\\nSmith, a Treehouse Eyes doctor featured on KVUE-TV in Austin, Texas provides\\nsome tips on how to detect myopia, “Parents can be looking for if the child is\\nsquinting, if they can’t see the board at school they might be complaining of\\nheadaches, or holding books closer to their face holding their phone closer,\\nmaybe getting closer to the television.” So why is it essential to go through\\nmyopia management and treatment rather than just getting glasses? Dr. Smith\\nexplains why myopia treatment is critical, “If the child is diagnosed with\\nmyopia, just getting glasses can help them see clearly, but will not do\\nanything to stop the progression or prevent the eyeball from getting longer.\\nSo you want to be able to have those specialized treatments to actually stop\\nthat process which in turn can prevent sight threatening disorders later on.”\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia Treating myopia early is\\ncrucial to prevent children’s vision from getting worse. Our mission is to\\ngive children better vision for life so children can have a life advantage to\\nbeing able to participate in more activities. Myopia management also provides\\na lower risk for future vision related disease such as glaucoma, macular\\ndegeneration, and cataracts.

April 10, 2023 by Lumen Optometric What Is Myopia?\\nMyopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a common vision problem that will\\naffect half the world’s population by 2050. It occurs when the eye is unable\\nto focus on distant objects without corrective lenses like glasses or\\ncontacts. Myopia is caused by a variety of factors, including genetic and\\nenvironmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. Is Myopia Genetic? If\\nyou’re thinking about myopia, knowing if it’s genetic is essential. If you\\nhappen to be myopic, then your kids might be at risk of developing the same\\ncondition. Myopia has two types: genetic and non-genetic (or “acquired”).\\nGenetic myopia is passed down through families and tends to run in certain\\nclusters or patterns. Non-genetic means that individuals develop their vision\\nissues without any family history or a genetic predisposition toward poor\\nvision. In general, suppose both parents have healthy eyesight but have\\nchildren with poor vision (without any other eye problems). It’s likely that\\nthose kids were born with a form of genetic myopia known as Axial Myopia (AM).\\nAbout half of all cases fall into this category! Why Does Myopia Get Worse\\nwith Age? When you find out your child is first diagnosed with myopia, it is\\nessential to intervene as early as possible. Myopia progresses when a child’s\\neye grows too long from front to back, causing permanent and irreversible eye\\ngrowth, known as axial elongation (the measure of the eye from front to back).\\nWhen a Treehouse Eyes doctor finds a low level of myopia (nearsightedness),\\nit’s easier to treat with a wider range of treatment options. In short, myopia\\nchanges as we age due to axial length elongation that occurs during childhood.\\nThe longer the eyeball gets, it’s associated with serious eye conditions that\\ncan lead to permanent vision loss such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, and\\ncataracts. This is why it is imperative to treat myopia as early as possible\\nand start getting your child’s eye examined annually to catch any changes in\\ntheir vision. How to Stop Myopia from Getting Worse with Age To prevent myopia\\nfrom getting worse with age, it’s important to get your child regular eye\\nexams and see the treatment options for myopia such as custom contact lenses\\nor prescription eye drops. If you’re concerned about your eyesight, it’s\\nalways a good idea to schedule an appointment with a Treehouse Eyes\\noptometrist. Conclusion Myopia is a common vision problem that affects\\nmillions of people worldwide. It is caused by a variety of factors, including\\ngenetics and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. The key to\\nproperly treating myopia and preventing it from worsening is by catching it\\nearly, typically in childhood. By following the tips mentioned above, you can\\nhelp prevent myopia from getting worse and maintain good eye health.

There is some\\ndebate about whether myopia is a disease or a refractive error. The answer is\\nuncovered by how myopia is defined and measured. What Is The Definition Of A\\nDisease? The Review of Myopia Management provides a few definitions of disease\\nto consider: A disease is any harmful deviation from the normal structural or\\nfunctional state of an organism, generally associated with certain signs and\\nsymptoms and differing in nature from physical injury. (Encyclopedia\\nBritannica, 2020) A disease is an abnormal condition affecting a living\\norganism. Diseases are generally understood to be medical conditions that\\ninvolve a pathological process associated with a specific set of symptoms.\\n(Infectious Disease News, 2019) Myopia, also called nearsightedness or\\nshortsightness, is the inability to see objects at a distance and is the most\\ncommon vision issue amongst children and adults. Myopia’s main symptom is\\nblurry distance vision; however, the physiological implications of myopia is\\nthat the eyeball itself grows too long from front to back, see figure 1 below.\\nIs Myopia Curable? The question of whether or not myopia is curable helps\\nillustrate why myopia is a disease. Treehouse Eyes doctor, Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D.\\naddresses the common question, “Can myopia be cured?” Myopia is not curable,\\nbut it can be treated. “Unfortunately, once myopia happens, which happens due\\nto the eyeball growing too long, it is impossible to shrink it afterwards.\\nWhen myopia occurs, it is permanent and irreversible.” Dr. Mai then goes on to\\nexplain the importance of early intervention, “We can prevent high levels of\\nmyopia which are associated with diseases such as macular maculopathy and\\nretinal detachment. Starting treatment early is critical because there is no\\ncure for myopia and once a child is diagnosed with this disease, it typically\\ngets worse if left untreated.” Myopia is a disease that can be treated at the\\nsource by providing children with treatment options, rather than just giving a\\nchild glasses for the symptom of myopia which is blurry vision. Myopia Is a\\nDisease Although myopia has symptoms like blurry vision, that aren’t caused by\\nphysical injury, myopia itself is caused by the eye growing too long. In other\\nwords, the axial length increases outside of the normal rate for a child’s\\nage. See Figure 2 below. Image Source The elongation of the eye is the core\\nissue. Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. details, “The greater the myopia, the longer the\\naxial length of the eye and thus greater risk. Myopia is clearly a disease.\\nOne that requires treatment to reduce the negative impact it can have on a\\nperson’s eye health and vision.” Myopia is a significant, prevalent disease in\\nchildren with increasing rates of progression. There are also two types of\\nclassifications: non-pathologic and pathologic myopia.

The goal of this procedure is to reduce\\nmyopia or nearsightedness of patients. To know more about Ortho-K and what to\\nexpect, here is a list of frequently asked questions. 1\\\\. “Are there age\\nrestrictions for Ortho-K?” None. Children as young as six years old have been\\ntreated with Ortho-K lenses. In fact, the treatment is one of the most common\\nmethods of vision correction in pre-teens and teens. 2\\\\. “Who is considered a\\ngood candidate?” Ortho-K proves to be an effective treatment for farsighted,\\nnearsighted and astigmatic patients. If your child has been unable to wear\\ncontact lenses, due to discomfort or allergies, they make a good candidate.\\nThis is because Ortho-K lenses are easy to use and can be worn while sleeping.\\n3\\\\. “How do Ortho-K lenses differ from typical lenses?” Ortho-K contact lenses\\nare specifically designed with highly oxygen-permeable material. The back\\nsurface of the lens is particularly made to enable the reshaping of the\\ncorneal tissue. 4\\\\. “How long does it take to reach good vision?” Stable\\nvision can be achieved after 10-14 days of treatment, depending on the\\nprescription. In fact, 50-70% of the desired visual correction is attained\\nafter the first night of wear. 5\\\\. “How long can Ortho-K provide myopia\\ncontrol?” The effect of myopia control should last as long as your use of\\nOrtho-K lenses. It is advisable for young children to wear the lenses until\\ntheir late teens when myopia tends to destabilize. Fortunately, there are no\\nanecdotal reports from patients that state ‘rebounding’ after their use of\\northo-K contact lenses has come to an end. To get started with Ortho-K\\ntreatment, it is essential to contact a trusted eye exam doctor. Here at Lumen\\nOptometric, we strive to provide excellent full-service eye care solutions\\nwith outstanding patient care services to match.

This is especially true with\\nthe pandemic upheaving our lives and forcing us to stay home for virtual\\nlearning or work from home. The consequences are not just limited to\\nheightened obesity rates. Studies have shown that having less sunlight could\\nactually change the ways that a child’s eyes develop, resulting in a myopia\\nepidemic that rises in tandem with the obesity crisis. You need to encourage\\nyour child to spend more time outdoors to protect their eyesight and prevent\\nmyopia. Downsides of Spending Time Indoors According to a recent Australian\\nstudy, kids who spend only about 20 minutes per day outdoors experience\\nquicker growth in the length of their eyes than those who log more hours in\\nbright eyes. This can result in myopia and trouble seeing faraway objects.\\nThankfully, there are some ways available that you can still use to keep an\\neye on your child’s eyesight. They are listed as follows. Not Enough Outdoor\\nTime Spending at least 2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent\\nthe onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to\\nplay every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Encourage\\nOutdoor Time Our eyes need an optimal amount of bright light that can be\\ngotten from outdoors. Therefore, by aiming for around 40 minutes of outdoor\\ntime daily, not only can your children get the physical activity that they\\nneed that day, but it can also be beneficial to their eyes and help to prevent\\nthe onset of myopia. Look out for Warning Signs It is important to look out\\nfor warning signs that your child might have myopia so that they can get\\ntreated for it early. Children suffering from myopia may squint, constantly\\nfeel the need to rub their eyes or complain of consistent headaches, they may\\nalso start having trouble with their academic grades. If your child\\nexperiences any of these symptoms, it is important to schedule an appointment\\nwith an optometrist. Schedule Regular Screenings To help prevent or manage\\nmyopia, it is important to have regular eye screenings for your child. Doctors\\nrecommend yearly vision screenings either by your child’s pediatrician or\\ntheir school as well as a vision screen at well-child visits through age 4.\\nNewborn babies should also have their vision tested before they leave the\\nhospital, and before your child hits the age of 5, it is important to take\\nthem to a pediatric ophthalmologist for a thorough checkup if they are\\nsuffering from any vision concerns or have a family history of vision\\nconcerns. If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is\\nthat myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision.\\nHaving myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing\\nserious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment,\\ncataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia\\ncan be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease. You can\\nprevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling your child’s myopia\\nconsultation with us today.

But how much do you really know about this progressive eye disease?\\nSome parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is\\nthe only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much\\nmore to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll\\nexplore 4 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about\\nyour child’s eye health and long-term vision. Myopia is an Eye Disease Myopia\\nis an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be\\nfocused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is\\nelongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading\\nobjects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is\\nround like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. As this\\nhappens, the symptoms of the disease are blurry distance vision. Because the\\neye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops\\nelongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This\\nalso means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience\\ngrowth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in\\ntheir myopia. To help combat this, we recommend eye exams every six months to\\ntrack myopia progress. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye\\ndisease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people\\nworldwide. We are currently on pace to have half of the world’s population\\nwith some degree of myopia by the year 2050! Indoor time, excessive ‘near\\nwork’, and genetic factors all play a role in the growth of myopia. Education\\nFor Their Future Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses\\nthroughout the school-age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens.\\nBecause the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops\\nelongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This\\nalso means there may be times in a child’s development when they experience\\ngrowth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to\\neffectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child\\ngrows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye\\nhealth as they age. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease\\nMyopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration,\\nand retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50%\\nhigher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop\\ncataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults\\nthan children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of\\nclear vision — a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in\\nthe Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided\\ntheir children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic\\nmaculopathy fell by 40%.

Essentially, your child’s eye\\nis growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the\\nbody, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing\\nin early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s\\ndevelopment where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher\\nprescription due to an increase in their myopia. It can affect both children\\nand adults, with over 50% of American teenagers being myopic according to this\\njournal. Here are some ways to recognize the signs and symptoms of myopia in\\nchildren. Consistent Headaches Headaches can be a common system of vision\\nproblems, it is important to track how often your child is experiencing\\nsymptoms of headaches. Some headaches may be a result of allergy symptoms or\\npressure changes, but they could also be a direct result of nearsightedness.\\nIf your child is experiencing more than one headache per week, do schedule an\\nappointment with an optometrist or pediatrician to try and get your vision\\nchecked for myopia. Excessive Eye-Watering Excessive eye-watering can also be\\na symptom of myopia, given that it can result in discomfort in the eyes. If\\nyour child experiences consistent and excessive eye-watering, do schedule an\\nappointment with an optometrist to get your vision checked. Excessive\\nSquinting If your child is squinting excessively, it might also be a symptom\\nof myopia. This is due to the fact that humans suffering from myopia squint as\\na result in changes in the tension of their eye muscles, providing them with\\nbrief clarity of vision. Thereby, it should be easy to spot individual\\nsuffering from nearsightedness if he or she engages in excessive squinting.\\nHolding Objects Close to Their Face Another glaring symptom to look for if\\nwondering is if your child constantly holds objects closer to their face to\\nsee them properly. This is a clear symptom of nearsightedness which may be\\ncaused by excessive usage of screen time. Consistent Rubbing Of Eyes When\\ndealing with a young child that might potentially have myopia, they might\\noften rub their eyes as a sign of discomfort. If you notice that your child\\nexcessively and consistently rubs their eyes, it might be a sign to schedule a\\nconsultation with the optometrist to have their vision assessed. Sitting Very\\nClose to the TV You might find your child sitting too close to the TV than\\nthey normally do. The most apparent sign that your child may have myopia,\\nespecially for older kids, is if they grumble about the images on the TV\\nscreen looking unclear or blurry, or if they tell you they have issues reading\\nthe words shown on screens.

In today’s article, your\\ntrusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric shares some simple eye health\\ntips for young adults. Take a Break When Using Digital Devices Young adults\\ntend to spend a lot of time on their digital devices. Unfortunately, staring\\nat a computer or phone screen for too long can make the eyes feel dry and\\ntired, eventually causing blurred vision. This is because people tend to blink\\nless when staring at a digital screen. To avoid digital eye strain, you need\\nto give your eyes frequent breaks. You can do this by following the 20-20-20\\nrule: after 20 minutes of screen time, look at an object 20 feet away for 20\\nseconds to give your eyes a break. Practice Good Contact Lens Hygiene If you\\nwear contact lenses, it’s critical to observe proper hygiene to avoid eye\\ninfections. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses and keep water away from your\\ncontacts. Use fresh contact lens disinfecting solution every time. Always wash\\nyour hands with soap and water and then dry them with a clean cloth before\\ntouching your contact lenses. Most importantly, follow your eye doctor’s\\nrecommendations about replacing your contact lenses. Don’t wear a pair of\\ncontact lenses beyond their scheduled replacement date. Lead a Healthy\\nLifestyle The three most important things you can do to safeguard your vision\\nare maintaining a healthy diet, exercising often and avoiding smoking. Leading\\na healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing eye diseases like age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and diabetic retinopathy.\\nYou should also practice good sleeping habits. Lack of sleep can adversely\\naffect your health in many ways. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of eye\\ncare services including orthokeratology therapy, neurolens therapy and more.\\nWe use the latest research and technology to give our local patients the very\\nbest treatments.

In our technologically driven\\nworld, conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism are becoming\\nincreasingly prevalent among children. This article will unpack these\\nconditions, helping you understand what they are, how they differ, and most\\nimportantly, what you can do to manage and treat them. The Differences Between\\nMyopia and Astigmatism Myopia results when your eye grows too long from front\\nto back, causing light to focus before it reaches the retina. If a normal eye\\nis shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye may more closely resemble a\\nfootball. In contrast, astigmatism is usually due to an irregularly shaped\\ncornea or lens. Myopia primarily affects distance vision, while astigmatism\\naffects vision at all distances. Both conditions can coexist in one eye, and\\nthey often do. This combination can further complicate vision, making it\\ncrucial to address both issues. Combining Science and a Child-Centric Approach\\nAt Treehouse Eyes®, we combine robust, science-backed data with inspiring\\naesthetics for both children and parents alike. We’ve created an environment\\nthat children love, helping to alleviate the fear sometimes associated with\\nmedical appointments. Our team of experts provides thorough eye examinations\\nusing the latest technology, identifying refractive errors and other eye\\nhealth issues early. We then create a personalized treatment plan that suits\\nthe needs and lifestyle of your child. Myopia and astigmatism are common eye\\nconditions that can affect children of all ages. If your child has been\\ndiagnosed with either of these conditions, it’s important to seek early\\ntreatment to protect their vision and prevent further complications. Managing\\nMyopia and Astigmatism with Treehouse Eyes® So, how can you protect your\\nchild’s vision if they’re diagnosed with myopia or astigmatism? Treehouse\\nEyes® is the first and only dedicated myopia management service provider in\\nthe United States. Our myopia management treatment options help slow down the\\nprogression of myopia in children, reducing the risk of developing severe\\nvision problems later in life.

If this is the case, you may feel relieved about this, but does\\nit really mean you have perfect vision? To answer this, we’ll first explain\\nthe related vision terminology to help you understand how we measure your\\nvision’s quality. Visual Acuity Visual acuity is the term used to express the\\nclarity or sharpness of your vision. This is measured by your ability to\\nidentify the letters or numbers on a standardized eye chart while standing at\\na certain distance. So, for instance, if you have 20/20 vision, you can see\\nclearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance. Similarly,\\nif you have 20/100 vision, it must mean that you can see as close as 20 feet\\nto see what those with 20/20 vision normally see at 100 feet. 20/20 vision\\ndoesn’t always mean your eyesight is perfect. For instance, if you’re getting\\nnearsighted, we may recommend that you use our orthokeratology lenses to slow\\nits progression. But then this only indicates how sharp and clear your vision\\nis at a distance. There are also other vision skills that are just as\\nimportant, such as eye coordination, side vision, focusing ability, color\\nvision, and depth perception. The Snellen visual acuity system is named after\\nthe Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, who developed the system in 1862.\\nThe system uses acuity measurements in fractions of 20/20, 20/40, 20/60, and\\nso on. The numerator or the top number of the Snellen fraction is the distance\\nbetween the eye chart and the patient. In the U.S., the viewing distance is\\nusually 20 feet while in other countries, it’s 6 meters. Meanwhile, the bottom\\nnumber of the fraction corresponds to the visual acuity of the patient. Higher\\nnumbers mean less clarity and sharpness in eyesight. For instance, the Big “E”\\nthat you see in most Snellen eye charts corresponds to 20/200 visual acuity.\\nIf this is the only letter you can discern, then there’s a chance that you may\\nbe legally blind unless prescribed with corrective contact lenses. The Factors\\nand Limits The major factors that determine visual acuity are as follows: 1\\\\.\\nThe accuracy of how the lens and cornea of the eye focuses light onto the\\nretina 2\\\\. The sensitivity of the nerves in the retina and vision centers in\\nthe brain 3\\\\. The ability of the brain to interpret information received from\\nthe eyes Visual acuity tests are quite useful in measuring the clarity of your\\neyesight in standardized conditions, it’s not completely accurate in\\ndetermining the overall quality of your vision. Some of its limitations are\\nthat it can’t measure how well you see colored objects, moving objects, or\\nobjects that are similar in brightness to their background.

June 15, 2023 by Morris Ilagan\\nWhen it comes to common vision disorders, myopia and hyperopia are often\\nconfused. In the article, we’ll dive deep into these distinct vision\\nimpairments, understand their distinctive characteristics, and explore current\\ntreatment modalities. Understanding Myopia and Hyperopia Myopia, also referred\\nto as nearsightedness, is a vision condition whose symptoms are blurry\\ndistance vision. This is a result of the eye growing too long from front to\\nback leading to blurry vision when looking at faraway objects. On the other\\nhand, hyperopia, or farsightedness, is the opposite. Distant objects are\\nclear, but those up close appear blurry. This condition occurs when the eye is\\ntoo short from front to back, or the cornea is too flat, leading to light\\nfocusing behind the retina. Diagnosis and Differences The diagnosis of both\\nconditions involves scheduling a routine eye exam – especially one trained to\\nspot myopia like the doctors at Treehouse Eyes. These exams include visual\\nacuity tests, refraction assessments, and eye health evaluations. Be sure that\\nyour eyecare provider is measuring your child’s axial length to ensure an\\naccurate diagnosis of myopia. Axial length will measure how long the eye is\\nfront to back. Notably, the critical difference between myopia and hyperopia\\nlies in their distinct symptoms and the way they affect vision. People with\\nmyopia often have difficulty viewing road signs, and whiteboards, or watching\\na movie at a cinema or at home. In contrast, those with hyperopia may struggle\\nwith tasks like reading, using a smartphone, doing homework, and other times\\nwhere closer vision is necessary. Treatment Modalities Fortunately, both\\nmyopia and hyperopia are manageable with several treatment options. The key\\nfor both, but especially myopia, is early detection and treatment. Myopia is a\\ndisease that typically develops in children (ages 6 – 12) and continues\\nthrough puberty until the child stops growing. This can sometimes be well into\\nadulthood (25 years old in some cases) which is why early treatment and\\nprevention are key to slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. For\\nchildren, orthokeratology, or Ortho-K, is a potential treatment. It involves\\nthe use of specially designed gas-permeable contact lenses that temporarily\\nreshape the cornea to help treat your childs myopia. Recent studies suggest\\nthat certain types of multifocal contact lenses may slow the progression of\\nmyopia in children. Furthermore, low-dose atropine eye drops have shown\\npromising results in minimizing the advancement of myopia. Conclusion\\nUnderstanding the differences between myopia and hyperopia is vital in\\nrecognizing the need for a timely eye exam and appropriate treatment. Through\\nmodern optometry, children are now able to receive the treatment and care they\\nneed to improve their vision and quality of life. Remember, regular eye\\nexaminations are critical to detect any visual impairments at an early stage.\\nIf your child is experiencing any changes in their vision, contact your local\\nTreehouse Eyes doctor. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment\\nplans for your child. Our treatment plans include special prescription eye\\ndrops and customized daytime and overnight contact lenses.

Still, it\\ncan also bring a host of changes to your vision. As the hormones in your body\\nchange and fluctuate during this period, you may experience various eye-\\nrelated issues that can affect how clearly you see or make your eyes\\nuncomfortable It’s good to be aware of these common changes and take steps to\\nprotect your vision throughout pregnancy. Common Vision Changes During\\nPregnancy Here’s what you can expect: Dry Eyes – Many women experience dry\\neyes during pregnancy due to hormonal fluctuations. It usually happens around\\nmid-pregnancy when hormone levels are at their highest point and decreases\\nafter delivery as hormone levels return to normal. Blurry Vision – During\\npregnancy, it is not uncommon for women’s eyesight to become blurry or cloudy\\ndue to their changing hormones. It should resolve itself once their hormone\\nlevels return to normal after childbirth. Light Sensitivity – Some pregnant\\nwomen find themselves more sensitive than usual when exposed to bright lights,\\nsuch as sunlight or fluorescent lighting in stores or office buildings, which\\ncan cause discomfort. Floaters – Small spots may appear in front of one’s\\nfield of vision, known as floaters. These tend to increase with age but may\\ntemporarily worsen during pregnancy because many people become dehydrated\\nwhile expecting a baby. Glaucoma – Women with a family history of glaucoma are\\nat higher risk for developing it during the later stages of their pregnancies,\\nso regular checkups with an optometrist will help ensure that any potential\\nproblems are caught early on before causing further damage. Eye Health During\\nPregnancy Here are some tips for protecting vision during pregnancy: Eat\\nplenty of fruits and vegetables high in vitamins A and C. Drink plenty of\\nfluids, like water, every day. Wear sunglasses outdoors if needed. Get regular\\ncheckups from an optometrist throughout all trimesters. Rest often and get\\nadequate sleep each night. Manage stress by taking breaks from work,\\nexercising regularly, etc. Why You Should Get Checked If pregnant women fail\\nto protect their vision, they risk serious complications such as premature\\nbirth, miscarriage and gestational diabetes. Regular optometrist visits are\\nessential to catch any potential problems before they become more severe.\\nLumen Optometric in Sierra Madre, CA, is dedicated to providing comprehensive\\neye care for all stages of life. We offer various services, such as\\ncomprehensive eye exams, contact lens fittings and treatment for dry eye.

As the only\\nneurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley, Lumen Optometric\\ncustomizes state-of-the-art lenses that bring clarity and comfort to patients\\nsuffering from migraines, neck strain, tired eyes and more. Our goal is to\\nhelp your eyes and head feel less tortured at the end of the day, so if you\\nsuffer from any of the following symptoms, Lumen Optometric can help: > How\\nNeurolens Therapy Works Your brain is constantly in communication with your\\ntwo eyes, keeping them aligned and in sync to help you see the world without\\ndouble vision. If your eyes are misaligned, however, your brain struggles to\\nmaintain balance. Without this balance, you could experience constant\\nheadaches, migraines, tension in and around your eyes, dizziness and even neck\\nstiffness. Add misalignment to the strenuous demands that computer screens,\\nphones and other digital devices place on your visual system, and you could\\nface daily suffering. Fortunately, 10 years of research into headaches and\\ntheir associated visual symptoms has yielded the revolutionary neurolens\\ntreatment. Neurolens therapy helps correct misalignment at the distance where\\nyou need the most help. Whether you struggle to see far away or up close,\\nLumen Optometric can provide customized neurolenses that correct your specific\\nmisalignment and give you the most comfortable vision possible. Lumen\\nOptometric is proud to offer this exciting new technology and we’d love to\\nhelp you discover relief for your symptoms! Check out the following video for\\na neurolens overview, and then read on for answers to some of the FAQs we\\nreceive. Neurolens FAQ What makes this any different than the glasses I wore\\nin the past? The difference is in the technology and the visual experience.\\nNeurolenses utilize patented, clinically tested technology to correct your\\nmisalignment at your prescribed working distance. There is no lens on the\\nmarket that offers the same technology. And Lumen Optometric keeps several\\nsets of neurolens prescriptions on hand, so if you are a candidate for a\\nneurolens treatment, you’ll have the opportunity to see and feel the neurolens\\ndifference at the end of your exam! How do you measure my misalignment? Lumen\\nOptometric utilizes a sophisticated instrument called the SightSync to measure\\nyour eye misalignment at varying distances. Coupled with specialized in-office\\ntesting, your eye measurements allow us to create a lens that helps with your\\nspecific symptoms. How quickly can I expect my symptoms to improve? Most Lumen\\nOptometric patients notice an improvement within the week, although patients\\nwith extremely chronic conditions may require six to eight weeks to notice an\\nimprovement. Are there any side effects to the neurolenses? First-time\\nneurolens wearers typically report feeling lighter, as if there’s less burden\\non their heads, necks, shoulders and eyes. But, as with any new type of lens,\\nyou may feel disoriented for about a week as your brain adapts. Schedule an\\nEvaluation Today If you work on the computer for a good chunk of the day,\\nsuffer from migraines or experience dry eyes, let Lumen Optometric put relief\\nin sight. We’re the only eye clinic in the San Gabriel Valley to offer\\nneurolens treatment technology. In fact, we’re only the sixtieth clinic in the\\nworld to offer the neurolens!

It’s possible with\\nOrthokeratology (Ortho-K) from Lumen Optometric. Ortho-K is an FDA-approved,\\nnon-surgical treatment that corrects your vision by gently reshaping your eyes\\nwhile you sleep. In the morning, you simply remove your custom Ortho-K lenses\\nand experience clear vision all day! ORTHOKERATOLOGY FOR ADULTS: One of the\\nbiggest breakthroughs in correcting your myopia (aka nearsightedness) or\\nhyperopia (aka farsightedness) is a process called Orthokeratology, or\\nOrtho-K, for short. It is a revolutionary system that accomplishes three\\nthings-it corrects your vision while you sleep, removes the need for daytime\\ndistance glasses/contacts, and allows you to avoid dryness, irritation, or\\nallergies with traditional contacts. HOW IT KEEPS YOUR EYES HEALTHY: Relative\\nto wearing soft contacts, which are worn for a period of 12-18 hours a day,\\nOrtho-K lenses are only worn while you sleep, so the overall wear-time is much\\nless. Additionally, these lenses are only worn under clean conditions (you’re\\nat home!) so there’s much less of a chance of allergies and virus/bacterial\\ndeposits. HOW IT GIVES YOU CLEAR VISION: You wear a special retainer-like lens\\nto sleep and upon waking, you remove the lenses. When the lenses are off, you\\nwill be able to see clearly for the rest of the day. Glasses or traditional\\ncontacts will never have to be worn again for the distance so long as you wear\\nyour Ortho-K lenses to bed every night. Depending on your needs for reading,\\nOrtho-K can be modified to enhance your reading vision, but reading glasses\\nmight still be needed depending on your age and intensity of your near-work.\\nWHAT ELSE MAKES ORTHO-K UNIQUE? Ortho-K is only worn while in the comfort and\\ncleanliness of your own home so you will never have to worry about\\nlosing/breaking/tearing glasses/contacts while at work or participating in\\nsports. It is a great option for farsighted patients who are having trouble\\nadapting to wearing glasses. Additionally, it is also a wonderful option for\\nathletes, outdoor enthusiasts, or patients with dry eyes or severe allergies\\nwho can no longer tolerate soft contact lenses.

There are no age requirements. I HAVE\\nMYOPIA (aka NEARSIGHTEDNESS) WHAT IT MEANS: You were prescribed glasses for\\nthe distance (driving, TV, anything greater than a couple feet away). At a\\ncertain prescription, you see better up close without your glasses/contacts.\\nHOW ORTHO-K CAN HELP: You won’t need to put on glasses to see in the distance\\nany longer! *For those of you who are myopic but need reading help with\\nprogressive lenses, Ortho-K can also be built with a reading enhancement to\\naid with reading. I HAVE ASTIGMATISM IT’S COMPLICATED: Astigmatism can occur\\nwith both myopia and hyperopia WHAT IT MEANS: You see slightly distortion and\\nshadows without your glasses, which you might wear for both distance and near.\\nHOW ORTHO-K CAN HELP: You won’t experience the distortion nor shadows! I HAVE\\nHYPEROPIA (AKA FARSIGHTEDNESS) Farsightedness is more complicated, it breaks\\ndown into two categories (simplified for this web format) CATEGORY 1: You’re\\nfarsighted and only have trouble with reading. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has\\nbeen fairly clear for your whole life, but upon landing in your 40-50s, you\\nfind that you now need reading glasses. HOW ORTHO-K CAN HELP: You won’t need\\nreading glasses for most tasks and your distance will likely subtly improve.\\nCATEGORY 2: You’re farsighted and have trouble with both reading and the\\ndistance. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has been clear up until your 30-40s, but now\\nyou need glasses for both distance and near. HOW ORTHO-K CAN HELP: This\\nscenario is the most life-changing for patients! Ortho-k essentially reverses\\nyour visual experience by about 20 years, back to a time when you were able to\\nwake up seeing 100% clear. Other eye health factors need to be taken into\\naccount before initiating Orthokeratology. During an Ortho-K consult, one of\\nour doctors will review your complete visual and systemic health to ensure\\nyou’re a good candidate.

Candidacy Our Technology\\nFrequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens\\nExams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID-19 Protocols Videos About Us\\nOffice Testimonials Blog Frequently Asked Questions / Orthokeratology /\\nFrequently Asked Questions Below are the top ten most frequently asked\\nquestions. We have a longer list that can be emailed as well. I just have to\\nsleep in these lenses to see clearly? Yes, the lenses gently mold your eyes\\nwhile you sleep. As long as you sleep in the lenses for a continuous 6-8\\nhours, your vision will reach full, waking-hour clarity within a 1-2 week time\\nframe. So what do I wear in the meantime in those first 1-2 weeks? During your\\ntransition period and depending on the size/type of your prescription, you\\nwill be given soft contacts or loaner glasses to ease the transition. What can\\nI expect during the first 1-2 weeks? Your vision will become clearer day by\\nday, and the clarity will last longer and longer with each passing day. But\\nduring the first couple of weeks, your vision will go from clear to your\\noriginal level of blurriness by the day’s end. The period of blurriness\\ndecreases with each day until full clarity is reached. How does the lens feel?\\nThe lens is made with a more rigid material, so initially it’s more noticeable\\nand requires a little more adaptation. The good news is that since the lenses\\nare inserted right before bedtime, most of the adaptation takes place while\\nyou sleep! How long does the Ortho-K effect last after the initial transition\\nperiod? The vision-correcting effect is programmed to last for ~24 hours, but\\nsome patients can experience clear vision for 36 hours without having to\\nrewear the lens. How long your vision remains clear after 24 hours depends on\\nthe size of your prescription. Is vision clear while I’m wearing the Ortho-k\\nlenses? Yes, vision is very clear with the lenses on. They are designed not\\nonly to mold the cornea, but to also give you clear vision if you have to wake\\nup in the middle of the night (for the restroom, emergency evacuations, etc).\\nWhat happens if I miss a night? Patients with lower prescriptions don’t notice\\nan obvious difference the next day, but patients with higher prescriptions\\nwill notice blurriness in the distance. Computer tasks for patients are\\ndefinitely workable if you miss a night, but night driving is not recommended.\\nSoft contacts can be given to you to make up for any residual blur. What\\nhappens if I decide to stop Ortho-K? Your vision returns to normal over 2-3\\nweeks, sometimes faster. Are there any side-effects to Ortho-K? Glare is the\\nprimary side effect, which occurs with any refractive procedure such as\\nLASIK/PRK/SMILE/etc as well. Glare tends to be more noticeable in the initial\\nadaptation period, which lasts 1-2 months. After that period, the brain learns\\nto adapt and filter out residual glare. I thought it was unhealthy to sleep in\\ncontacts? Patients are told not to sleep in traditional contacts because\\nthey’re worn throughout the day, throughout sleep, and again in the daytime\\nfor a minimum of at least 30 hours of wear time. Additionally,\\ndebris/germs/mucus accumulate on traditional lenses, which your eye is then\\nexposed to for the 30+ hours of wear. With Ortho-K, you only wear them for a\\nperiod of 7-8 hours maximum while under clean, home conditions.

Medmont is\\nhailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300”\\nbeing the gold standard topographer for over a decade. Their newest\\ntopographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more\\naccurately capturing your cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical\\naccuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your eye, which\\nyields faster, healthier, and clearer outcomes. WAVE CUSTOM LENS DESIGN Lumen\\nOptometric is the only office in Los Angeles County that employs WAVE to\\ncreate 100% fully-custom lenses for your eyes. WAVE combines all the\\ntopographical (corneal shape) data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to\\nspecify and manipulate every aspect of your lens design. Custom design\\nsoftware is extremely critical for both clarity and eye health because each\\npoint of the lens is based on information from your cornea. Tip for inquiring\\npatients – If you are told that you’re being fitted with custom lenses, ask to\\nsee your design. It should look similar to the screenshot above. If a doctor\\ntouts that they’re fitting a custom lens but is unable to show you a\\nscreenshot like the above where they can manipulate every aspect of every\\ncurve, they’re not designing a custom lens. All doctors will refer to their\\nlenses as custom, but it is actually quite rare because of the difficult\\ntraining, complicated CAD software, and cutting-edge equipment that is\\nrequired.

Scleral lenses are specialty, custom-molded lenses that\\nbring clear and comfortable vision to patients with corneal issues such as\\nkeratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, or post-LASIK complications. If\\nyour vision and comfort are lacking because of these complications, don’t\\nsettle. Sclerals represent the gold standard keratoconus treatment that is\\nnon-surgical. Dr. Eric To is the only practice-owning optometrist in Los\\nAngeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society.\\nWe’d love for you to experience effortless vision, so reach out and let Lumen\\nOptometric restore clarity and comfort to your vision. Scleral FAQs As a\\nleading scleral optometrist, Lumen Optometric has the information you need. To\\ngive our valued patients more detailed insight about scleral lenses, we’ve\\ncompiled a convenient list of FAQs. What are scleral lenses? Scleral lenses\\nare large-diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (the\\nclear window of the eye) and gently rest on the sclera (the white, outer layer\\nof the eye). The rigid nature of the lenses makes your vision extremely crisp.\\nScleral lenses should not be confused with traditional gas permeable (GP)\\nlenses. Traditional GP lenses are small lenses made of durable plastic that\\nsit on the extremely sensitive cornea. Conversely, scleral lenses tend to be\\nmuch more comfortable because they settle on the less-sensitive sclera. Who is\\na candidate for scleral lenses? Many patients can benefit from scleral lenses,\\nespecially those suffering from: Keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration\\nHigher prescriptions & visual needs that aren’t met by glasses or soft\\ncontacts Dry eyes, with or without soft contacts Glare/distortion after LASIK,\\nPRK or corneal transplants Exacting visual demands from things like sports,\\nvideography & photography Will I see a difference between scleral lenses and\\nsoft contact lenses? Scleral lens prescriptions offer greater vision and\\ncomfort than soft contact lenses because: Scleral lenses are built from highly\\ncustomizable materials that offer the clearest, most stable vision correction.\\nScleral lenses sit on the less-sensitive part of the eye and are inherently\\nmore stable. Scleral lenses offer options that make them more customizable for\\nfull distance clarity or for improved reading vision. Do all eye doctors fit\\nscleral lenses? Not all eye doctors fit scleral lenses, but Lumen Optometric\\nspecializes in advanced scleral fitting! Our talented scleral optometrist uses\\nan sMap3D instrument to capture a full 3D representation of your frontal eye.\\nThat custom scan helps us build a Scleral 2.0 lens that accurately fits your\\neye. Lumen Optometric is the only provider in the San Gabriel Valley to offer\\nthis state-of-the-art technology, and we liken the process to creating a 100%\\ncustom-made suit. Like a tailor designing a suit based on every measurement of\\nyour body, Lumen Optometric creates a scleral lens that is more accurate and a\\nhealthier fit for your eyes. What is a Scleral 2.0 lens? Traditional sclerals,\\nor scleral 1.0 lenses, have been used for roughly a decade. The newer, more\\ntechnologically advanced Scleral 2.0 lenses are customized specifically for\\nyour eye. So while creating a Scleral 2.0 lens is comparable to designing a\\ncustom-made suit, fitting scleral 1.0 lenses is similar to modifying an off-\\nthe-rack suit: you select a suit size that approximates your body shape and\\nmake a limited number of adjustments to help the suit drape over your body’s\\ncontours. Our mission at Lumen Optometric is to aim for a flawless fit with\\nyour scleral lenses, not a best-guess approximation. Check out these videos to\\nsee what a difference customized scleral lenses can make! What’s it like to be\\nfit with Scleral 2.0 lenses? An advanced scleral lens fitting starts with both\\ncorneal and scleral topography. A corneal topographer maps the cornea, the\\nclear window of the eye. Scleral topography is a separate, dedicated\\ninstrument that can scan the elevation changes of your eye’s white surface.\\nThis painless procedure does not require dilation drops, but it does require\\nthe use of a temporary dye that enhances our scans. We then place a calibrated\\n“test” scleral lens on your eye. That test lens gives you an opportunity to\\ntry out a scleral lens and gives us time to fine-tune your prescription. Once\\nyour prescription data is obtained, it’s combined with the shape data to\\ncreate your fully customized scleral lens. Please note that during a scleral\\nlens consultation, we take all necessary measurements of your eye. Be prepared\\nto set aside 60 minutes of eye doctor time to ensure that the measurements are\\ncorrect. What is the best keratoconus treatment for me? Or if I have pellucid\\nmarginal degeneration or any other condition where the cornea is no longer\\nconsistent in its shape (post-LASIK/RK/corneal transplant), how will sclerals\\nhelp me? Sclerals are the best keratoconus treatment available, they’re the\\ngold standard! They will give you clear, distortion-free vision. Think of an\\nirregular cornea as the warped windshield of a car. That warping distorts what\\nyou see through the windshield, leading to extreme glare in addition to\\ndistorted vision. When you fill a custom scleral lens with conditioning\\nsolution and apply it to your eye, the solution “mates” the scleral with your\\ncornea to give you a new, smooth, regular surface to see through. This\\nperfectly contoured surface cancels out your distortion and blur, leaving you\\nwith clear and comfortable vision. The outcomes are the same for keratoconus,\\npellucid, or any other type of corneal irregularity. If I’m already wearing\\nglasses or contacts and I see acceptably, will scleral lenses make a\\ndifference? That depends on how you define acceptable. Most people are fairly\\nadaptable to the options they’re given, so until you’re shown a difference,\\nyou may not be aware that the potential for improvement exists. For example,\\nif you’ve been wearing the same set of contacts for nearly a decade, there’s a\\ngood chance you’re missing out on clearer, healthier and more comfortable\\ntechnology. Lumen Optometric can keep you up-to-date on the best and\\nhealthiest options for your only set of eyes. The impact of scleral lenses\\nalso depends on your prescription. If you have an extremely minimal\\nprescription, scleral lenses will be more helpful in correcting dry eyes or\\nperformance-based vision. If you have a moderate or high prescription with\\nastigmatism, the benefit of sclerals will be vision that’s clearer and more\\nstable. Visual stability is something many of us take for granted until we are\\nshown what true stability looks like. For example, consider the fluidity of\\nthe newer 120hz televisions relative to their older 60hz counterparts. 60hz\\ntelevisions looked normal to us until the 120hz upgrades were released. When\\npatients have high levels of astigmatism, scleral lenses provide results\\nsimilar to that of seeing an image on a brand new, high-definition television\\nfor the first time! Corneal health is another factor to consider. If you have\\nany corneal issues, scleral lenses will significantly impact your vision and\\nimprove your quality of life. If my eyes are dry, how can sclerals help me?\\nWhen you apply a scleral lens to your eye, the “bowl” of the lens is filled\\nwith sterile conditioning solution. This conditioning solution is held against\\nyour eye for as long as you wear the lens, creating a moisture chamber that\\nhelps alleviate your dry eye. Of course, scleral lenses represent only one\\ntreatment modality within a greater dry eye treatment system. Severely chronic\\ndry eye patients may need additional treatments to overcome their dryness\\nsymptoms, and Lumen Optometric has several dry eye treatment plans available.\\nSchedule an Appointment Today Lumen Optometric combines the latest technology\\nwith advanced training to provide the clearest and healthiest vision for our\\npatients.

Researchers believe that the\\nenvironment kids grow up in today, with too many close distance activities\\n(like reading and device use) and lack of outdoor play, is contributing to the\\nrapid increase in childhood myopia. While glasses and contact lenses\\ncompensate for a child’s blurry vision, they don’t stop your child’s vision\\nfrom continuing to deteriorate. As children grow, myopia often develops as\\nthey reach school age and progresses into their late teens or early twenties.\\nThe Dangers of Myopia Researchers now know there is more to worry about with\\nmyopic eyes than the inconvenience of ever-thickening lenses. Scientific\\nevidence has proven that myopic patients are more vulnerable to a range of\\nsight-threatening diseases and complications. In fact, myopia is the sixth\\nleading cause of blindness. Patients with mild myopia have a four-fold\\nincrease in the risk of retinal detachment. For those with moderate to severe\\nmyopia, the risk increases ten times. One study concluded that more than 50\\npercent of retinal detachments not related to trauma are associated with\\nmyopia. Other myopia risks include glaucoma, cataracts, and macular\\ndegeneration. Myopia Can Be Managed The dangers of myopia, in conjunction with\\nthe normal challenges of subpar vision, mean it is important for parents of\\nmyopic children to manage the condition as part of your child’s eye health.\\nThe goal of myopia management is to slow the progression of myopia and reduce\\nits impact on your child’s life. The younger myopia management begins, the\\nmore effective the treatment. We are excited at Lumen Optometric to announce\\nthe launch of our children’s myopia management service in partnership with\\nTreehouse Eyes®, the country’s leading myopia management service. The\\nrevolutionary system, designed to treat your child’s myopia and significantly\\nreduce the threat of more serious eye diseases, is one of the most important\\ninnovations since glasses were first prescribed hundreds of years ago!

SO WHY DID THE SCREEN MOVE\\nFURTHER BACK WITH MYOPIC PATIENTS? This is due to the whole eye growing longer\\nin depth, which occurs in myopic patients. This front-to-back elongation moves\\nthe retina (the screen) beyond the point where the cornea (the projector)\\nexpects to concentrate its light to a focus. SO WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? When\\nthe outer shell of the eye (the sclera) elongates, it forces all the internal\\ncomponents that line the inside of the eye (the retina) to also stretch. There\\nare two problems with an enlarged eye and a stretched retina: Problem #1 – A\\nnuisance Your child has to wear stronger glasses/contacts every time their\\nprescription increases. They become dependent on glasses/contacts from the\\nmoment their eyes open in the morning to when their eyes close for bedtime.\\nProblem #2 – A health concern The stretched retina is thinned and weakened,\\nwhich leads to a higher risk of blinding eye diseases, such as myopic\\nmaculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts.

The bad news: there is a clear connection between\\nparents passing their nearsighted genes to their children. The good news: your\\ngenetics are not entirely to blame! Even though myopic inheritance has been\\nestablished, the steep rise in myopia over the past 50-60 years cannot be due\\nto inheritance alone. In the graph above, you will notice that in the 1940s,\\nthe prevalence of myopia in this select group of East Asian university\\nstudents was 10% to 37%. If you fast forward to the present, the prevalence is\\nstaggering; it is over 80% to 90%! It is impossible for such a sudden shift to\\nhave occurred in the gene pool of those nations—so the cause cannot be\\ngenetics alone. In looking for the cause of this progression, researchers\\nstudied the visual demands of those university students. It was demonstrated\\nthat the average student in Shanghai was responsible for 15 hours of homework\\nper week, compared to 6 hours per week in the United States. Even though the\\nprevailing thought that excessive close work leads to more myopia, they found\\nsomething else more interesting. They found that it was the lack of outdoor\\ntime that led to an earlier and more rapid nearsighted progression! One thing\\nthat is clear based on the epidemiological studies, and it is that genetics\\nalone cannot account for this explosive myopic epidemic. ARE ELECTRONIC\\nDEVICES HARMING MY CHILD’S EYES? The answer is a complicated “yes.” The logic\\nof excessive screen time worsening vision is sound, but there has been no\\nconclusive evidence that screen time alone contributes to myopic progression.\\nWhat is known is that with every moment our children are spending time indoors\\nwith their eyes glued to screens, they are not spending those moments\\noutdoors. This is where science has stepped in to find a strong correlation\\nbetween outdoor playtime and the slowed or delayed onset of myopia. Children\\nwho spend a couple of hours outdoors every day have been found to be four\\ntimes less likely to become myopic. Our stance when it comes to screen time is\\nboth scientifically-driven and rooted in common sense. Being outdoors provides\\nthe healthy sunlight our eyes and skin need. It’s also fantastic for both\\nphysical and visual development. Being less sedentary and more active outdoors\\nenforces better hand-eye coordination, depth perception, and eye coordination\\nskills. All efforts should be made to reduce screen time when possible for\\nthese reasons. Click here to learn about the treatments available to slow or\\nstop the progression of your child’s myopia.

Zeiss IOLMaster Optical Biometer An optical biometer is\\ntraditionally used by surgeons to perform power calculations for lenses that\\nare to be implanted in the eye. We utilize optical biometry for a different\\nreason: to measure the length of your child’s eye, which is referred to as\\naxial length. As your child grows, their eyes grow as well. Our goal is early\\ndetection and differentiation between natural growth of the eye versus\\naccelerated myopic progression. Since a longer eye leads to a stretched retina\\n(which has its own complications as seen in the “Is Myopia Unhealthy” page),\\nit’s critical that we know the rate at which your child’s eyes are growing.\\nPreviously, the only known method to monitor the eye’s growth was through the\\nprescription, but each prescription does not correlate with a specific eye\\nlength. Typically, prescription changes lag axial length changes, which means\\nthat if you only monitor through prescription, chances are that you will miss\\nlength changes that may have already occurred. Treehouse Eyes affiliates such\\nas our office are one of the few offices in all of Los Angeles County that\\nemploy technology solely to measure axial length for children. Medmont Meridia\\nCorneal Topographer A leading-edge topographer is critical to monitor how the\\ncornea (the clear window of the eye) changes over time with myopia treatments.\\nMedmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model\\n“E300” being the gold standard topographer for a decade. Their newest\\ntopographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more\\naccurately capturing your child’s cornea in three dimensions. Increased\\ntopographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your\\nchild’s eye, which yields faster and better outcomes. Medmont partnered with\\nLumen Optometric to help launch the new gold standard and we’re proud to be\\nable to offer this latest form of technology to our patients. WAVE Custom Lens\\nDesign Lumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles county that employs\\nWAVE to create 100% fully-custom lenses for your child. WAVE combines all the\\ntopographical data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and\\nmanipulate every aspect of your child’s lens design. From a doctor’s\\nperspective, the customizable nature of WAVE allows for (1) maximum myopia\\nmanagement, (2) more accurate vision correction, (3) increasing the level of\\nmyopia protection in a lens. For patients, it simply means their eyes are more\\nprotected from myopic progression, they see better and arrive at a clear\\nendpoint in less time. Aren’t All Myopia Management Lenses Custom? Depending\\non the type of lens a practitioner may be limited to (either due to technology\\nor training), their definition of custom will differ. This is an overview of\\nthe three different types of “custom” lenses you will encounter as a\\npatient/parent. Basic custom – These types of ortho-k lenses are similar to\\noff-the-rack suits in that they come in a predefined size. Depending on your\\nneeds, the suit is then upsized or downsized to another predefined size.\\n“Basic custom” ortho-k lenses exist in certain parameters and different lenses\\nare selected based on visual estimation. Due to the lack of true\\npersonalization, your child can share the same lens design as another patient.\\nSemi-custom – This category of ortho-k lenses begins to incorporate technology\\nsuch as topography in the design of the lens. Lens design software will use\\nthe topographical data to generate a lens off of an pre-established template.\\nTo return to the suit analogy, measurements are taken for a suit to be made,\\nbut the suits still have certain non-modifiable assumptions made about the\\nproportions. And if a suit has to be modified, you still operate within those\\nnon-modifiable template assumptions. Fully-custom – WAVE lenses are all fully-\\ncustom designs. WAVE lenses incorporate topographical data of the eye which\\ncan then be fully-manipulated by a Certified WAVE Designer (CWD). Every aspect\\nof the lens can be changed relative to one another, leading to the most form-\\nfitting and visually effective lens. We utilize WAVE lenses because our\\npatients see the best out of them! Tip – If a doctor can’t show you the visual\\nlayout of your child’s lens design with numerical readouts of those design\\nelements, it’s likely not a fully-custom lens. If you point to any one aspect\\nof the design and ask for it to be changed in real time for demonstration, yet\\nit can’t, it’s likely not a fully-custom lens. Lastly, fully-custom lenses are\\nall doctor-designed from start to finish, meaning that the lenses are all\\ndesigned in-house by the same doctor taking care of your child. Basic or semi-\\ncustom lens designers outsource their change requests to lens consultants.\\nFully-custom lenses require more training to design and troubleshoot, in\\naddition to requiring very specific hardware. We only fit fully-custom lenses\\nbecause they are the healthiest option for your child.

WHAT IS MYOPIA & WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT PROGRESSES?\\nWhen your child is myopic (which leads to nearsightedness), it means that\\ndistant objects are blurrier than near objects. To understand why this occurs,\\nlet’s first consider how a perfect eye works. Consider when conditions are\\nperfect: When light passes through the clear, front window of the eye\\n(cornea), it is focused on the inner lining of the eye (retina). Here’s an\\nanalogy (Figure 1): think of the cornea as a movie projector, with the retina\\nas a projector screen. The projector and the screen are 20 feet apart, and the\\nprojector casts its image 20 feet away onto the screen. The result is a clear\\nimage. Consider when the conditions are imperfect: A nearsighted eye is\\nlonger, which causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly\\non it, leading to a blurry image (Figure 2). Imagine the projector casting an\\nimage 20 feet away, but with the projector screen now sitting 25 feet away,\\nwhich leads to a blurry, out-of-focus picture.

The future is here and the answer lies with scleral lenses.\\nWILL I SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCLERAL AND SOFT LENSES?\\nScleral lenses are built from highly-\\ncustomizable, firm lens materials, which offer clearer vision relative to the standard soft lenses. Example: consider how vision \\nis better through a window versus clear, \\nflexible plastic sheeting.\\nCAN SCLERALS BE WORN THE WHOLE DAY?\\nThey can be worn for the full  course of the day.

      "my_row: [176, 5914, \" In this video, we'll go over my opium management decision making and some of the flow charts can be for fairly complicated and the tree-all size has one, but I think we like to, I've got it fairly simple, a simplified thing. And so we'll start with atropine here. Okay. So atropine we order from OSRX and it's at .025 and .05 are the percentages that they offer. You can also prescribe 1% if needed with progresses, with transitions. If we know that both parents have a super high prescription and the kid is progressing at a young age, okay, and their axial lengths are larger than they're supposed to be. The no need to worry about it. Doctors have used it for a long period of time. There's a lot more doctors who are scared about using, above never use it, that have opinions about it, but the doctors that have used 1%. Don't worry about it so much. It just works, right? And so atropine I typically say for children under six years old or as a combination treatment. Usually I tend to have there be more little boys on atropine as opposed to little girls because when it comes to little girls they tend to be a little bit more mature and the other options are more available to them. Okay. So these are the percentages we never prescribe .01 and then otherwise as combination treatment, we just consider a complex treatment with ortho-k or with soft multifocals if their axial length progression is greater than about maybe .2 millimeters per year, right? Anyone from .1.15, the truth is pretty normal, I sometimes you get .1 to .15, this is probably a upper limit. You shouldn't really be going above .2. And then the next is soft multifocal contact lenses and I as a breed them, abbreviated SMFCLs. And this is for low myopia. The reason why we mentioned low myopia is because when you're creating an ortho-k and you're asked why my why low myopia for this versus why not just fit them in ortho-k, you're trying to create a certain amount of plus in the pupil. And the thing is is that when you're trying to displace the tissue central, you're trying to displace the central tissue to the paressential area, the red ring, when the prescription is not that low there's actually not that much tissue displacement. So it's a little tough creating all that much plus in the pupil. Most doctors do mention that they still have done it, but I still like to play it safe. I don't, when it comes to wave, you can sort of calculate how much plus you're going to anticipate putting in the pupil and when it comes to low myopia designs, the numbers don't pan out. So I'd still prefer for the young prescriptions for the young kids to wear the soft multifocal and then when they do, I mean ultimately they'll still progress a little bit once they get into the .1.50s or so .1.25, .1.50, then you can switch them over to ortho-k. It's also a great option for parents who are hesitant about ortho-k. Some parents definitely do see the benefits and some patients, even though it's FDA-approved, they get a little bit nervous about sleeping in lenses, even though you explain to them exactly that you're only sleeping in the lenses, you're not, you're not supposed to sleep in normal soft contacts because typically if you're sleeping in them, that meant that you've been wearing them all day long. And that's not the case with ortho-k, but it works well as a bridge. And so again, soft multifocal scan also be used with atropane as well. If actually like there's not under good control. Normally I would start with natural view one day multifocal, unless the parent comes to a specifically mentioning my site one day. The main difference is that the my site one day, since they're the only ones that have the FDA approval for a soft contact, they actually charge a lot more for it. And the natural view tends to work better. It has higher parameters if it's needed and the amount of plus up that's generated out in the periphery is actually quite high. And this pans out even, you can tell for adults to, the adults tend to do a bit better when it comes to the natural view types of designs. As opposed to the standard, Coopervision, Biophinity, Proclear types of multifocal, right? And so for the kids, they get the same amount of higher plus out in the periphery. And then when it comes to ortho-k, well that's a typo. That's for greater than one doctor in myopia. So, you're at 125, 150 or so. If both eyes are 125, then I'll still suggest it, or if one eye is one, the other one is 150, then I'll still consider ortho-k. At that point, it's just simpler. Or if they have more cylinder than that. When we design it custom, we can actually knock out vast majority of the sill. Very rare. Do I recall having patients still have sill presenting even patients up to four to four to four to four to four to four to four to four to four to four to five to four. So it's the non-custom designs, right? that were the sill typically normally knocks down about half or so when it's customary really does take care of it because of our G-SIM designs most most standard non-custom lenses are R-SIM unless you go with something like dual access or whatnot and so even then the G-SIMs are more complicated than the dual access lenses and then ortho-k works better for patients who or parents have had lacic for their kids they understand it's almost like a form of lacic but it's protective and so when it comes to all the treatments that's basically what we have here and I think it'll get more complicated as we have more treatment options available to us as spectacle lenses come out but right now it's basically I imagine really young kids and then kind of in between this is for the best majority of the kids that we're going to meet it definitely has more of the appeal because they can see clear without having to work glasses right and so we're alternatively both of these are either one of these combined with that you can\", 'Doc_MyopiaDesignMaking.wav', None]\n",

And so I'm recording this today just to make sure that we have a little bit more clarity in terms of contact lenses. I've been seeing some news reports that mention that contact lenses aren't healthy to wear during times of the COVID pandemic. And I just want to make sure that everybody knows that there's absolutely no scientific basis, there's no studies that point towards any contact lens wear being unhealthy. And so there's some very specific guidelines to follow to make sure that you're wearing contact lenses in a healthy manner. And so most of these we've gone over with you in training or after you've worn contacts just as a quick touch point. And so one thing is to make sure your eyes washing your hands, okay, so 20 seconds is what we're aiming for here, I'd say a good solid 10 seconds of soaping, 10 seconds of rinsing and drying your hands very well, then and only then should you handle your lenses in the morning. So place them in and the rest of the day, as long as you're not touching your eyes or your face, then you'll be perfectly fine. In terms of disinfection, you have to make sure that you're disinfecting them well too. So most of the times we prefer the peroxide based solution, cleansers, and so usually you'll have a little case and you'll fill it with a solution that has a red cap and after six hours, it'll be completely disinfected. So if you're wearing lenses that you discard every two weeks or every month, or if you're wearing corneal reshaping lenses, you definitely want to make sure you're continuously cleaning your lenses every night or throughout the day, depending on how you wear your lenses. Now for daily disposables, when you do remove them at the end of the day, make sure again, your hands are clean, but you would just discard those lenses, okay? So again, so long as you're keeping your hands clean and you're disinfecting your lenses, there's nothing to worry about in terms of wearing your contact lenses. Again, if you have any questions, give us a call or you can email us or text us on our main line. You can find all that information on our website and hopefully we'll get to see you guys soon.

It was very painful. So good news now. It doesn't feel that way anymore, huh? Yeah. It's a huge difference, really huge. I can drive again. I was saying that one of my triggers was being in a dark room with lit screens, which was terrible for work meetings. I would sit in those meetings with my eyes closed, and people would think I was bored or tired. It was very embarrassing. I had to explain it to everybody, but I had a big test where I was at a conference for a whole week like this, and it was pretty great. I could go the whole day at the conference without problems. Yeah, that's wonderful. I mean, being able to do what you need to do without having all that discomfort, it really adds up. You think about the little bits of discomfort throughout the day, and you stretch it out over 8 to 10, 12 hours, and then it really starts adding up. I'm in animal care, and quality of life is something we discuss a lot, and my quality of life was pretty low, because it was on my mind just constantly, constantly bothering me. So, yeah, it's really improved my quality of life. So, you recommend it to family or friends if they have the same type of symptoms? Absolutely. I plan on telling people. I plan on posting about it. Hey, do you have these symptoms? You should see a specialist if you're in the area. So, yeah. I will be singing the praises of these lenses for sure. Yeah, I'm glad they really help you. What about your skepticism? Yeah, I was going to say, I was really skeptical. The thing is, I could see just fine, and for the most part, everything seemed like the glasses I was wearing was suited for what I needed, but I was having some sort of internal problem. In a way, I was, but really, I just didn't understand how lenses could fix that problem. But these are complex lenses, and they're really amazing, and my husband and I both did all the research. We thought it sounded a little cuckoo, but it was our last thing to try. So, really, it's, I am, I believe it now. Yeah. I'm so glad that they're working out for you. It sounds like such a cliche. I know. At the end, it always gets a little tricky. I'm a believer. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you so much for your time, and I'm glad everything's working out well for you. \", \"docs\\\\youtube\\\\Eye Fatigue Treatment - Leslie's Neurolens Testimonial.m4a\", None]\n",
      "my_row: [181, 1040, \"Here's a perfect eye that doesn't need a prescription, looking to the left. Light is focused by the cornea onto the inner surface of the eye, the retina. This is what's required to see clearly. For our young patients that become myopic, which leads to nearsightedness, their eyes elongate and the world now falls out of focus. Glasses or contacts are traditionally used to correct this blur. But as myopic parents know, the first pair of glasses or contacts is never the last. When a child wears traditional glasses or contacts, it corrects their central vision. But it wasn't until recently that we learned two new things. First, we learned that traditional glasses and contacts overcorrect their peripheral vision. Second, we learned that the brain pays more attention to the peripheral vision to regulate how the eye grows. Since the brain is watching this region, it grows the eye to land itself back on the plane of clear vision. This cycle repeats itself over and over again into adulthood, leading to worsening vision and eye health.\", 'docs\\\\youtube\\\\How And Why Do Eyes Worsen？.m4a', None]\n",
      "my_row: [182, 1215, \"This is an eye looking straight up towards the ceiling, and this is an ortho-k lens placed on the eye. Ortho-k lenses are shaped differently than standard contacts. They take on what I call a volcanic shape. Ortho-k lenses work by creating negative pressure, also known as suction, in the region under these humps. The cells then migrate and multiply in this region, ever so slightly thickening the zone. The cornea then takes on the shape of the ortho-k retainer lens. Now here's why ortho-k is special. Let's go back to the picture that we sketched in a previous Why do eyes get worse video. Remember how traditional glasses and contacts over corrected your child's peripheral vision, which led to the accelerated growth of the eye? With ortho-k, there's a unique optical effect that occurs. First, it allows your child to maintain clear vision wherever they're looking. Optically, ortho-k lenses cause the peripheral vision to be focused inside of the eye instead of behind it. Because the peripheral vision is focused inside of the eye, it reduces the stimulus for accelerated growth. And without the stimulus for growth, the eye will retain a smaller shape and your child's eyes will remain healthier for life.\", 'docs\\\\youtube\\\\How Ortho-K Works & How It Slows Myopia.m4a', None]\n",

Before I had scleral lenses, um, I had, I had gas permeable lenses and they were so uncomfortable and it always felt like I had glass in my eyes. It felt like, um, my eyes were super dry all the time. I travel often, so I needed something that was comfortable and that I was able to wear for long periods of time. Due to my condition, my condition in both of my eyes, I'm not able to wear glasses and see perfectly. So it was kind of mandatory for me to have contacts in order for me to see, um, exceptionally well. Right. Um, the process itself, it was so easy and the receptionist, everyone in Lumen Optometry, they were just answering all my questions that were so, um, flexible with their schedule. As I said earlier, I travel often, so I needed something, I needed a lot of time, um, to, first of all, I live in Marina Del Rey, so I needed a lot of time, um, to get there and they were just all very flexible with, um, their schedules. The other thing I wanted to say is that, um, the scleral lenses are so comfortable. It's so comfortable. Like, you don't even feel that they are. And I was really afraid because of the size of the scleral lenses, I never had anything, you know, that big, um, you know, in my eyes, so I wanted to make sure that it was, um, that it was going to be comfortable and it was. And Dr. Tove, um, definitely made sure that it was before I went home. Um, he, he, him and his receptionist made sure that I knew how to take off the lenses because it's a completely different process, um, than the gas permeable lenses that I had before and they made sure that I knew how to put them on by myself before I went home. So that process itself was, um, very thorough and I appreciate that they could, they were concerned about my health when it comes to that. Um, other than that, like I had an overall great experience. I recommend it to anyone moving forward. I definitely recommend it to my friends and family. Um, they were so easy to work with and they were really, really so happy to answer any of my questions.

Every time I was working on the computer, it gets really blurry, but after neurolenses, it helped a lot. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah, I know. This year, when you came back, for our viewers here, we always have patients take a survey, and the survey will ask questions, things about headaches and your severity of headaches, stiffness in your pain in your neck and shoulders, discomfort with computers, tired eyes. Christine landed fairly high on most of those. She ranked as very often under quite a few, and so when she came back for her yearly follow-up this time, she marked rarely for all of those, and so that's always a really, really positive finding.

She's been willing to help us out with this video testimonial of her SLARO lenses. So Cindy, when you first came in, what was going on with your current contacts and your issues that you're experiencing? Well, I had ongoing issues with my rigid cast permeable lenses, fogging up, just not clear, needing to take them out several times a day to clean them, to try to see better and I thought, gee, got to do something about this. So I called up the practice and was told that I probably would be a good candidate to look into the SLARO lenses and so I did. Oh, that's great. I remember when you first came in, you had mentioned that you were cleaning them, I think you had almost mentioned once every like 15, 20 minutes or something like that. Yes. Yeah. So it was impacting my lifestyle. I mean, I was nervous to go out because I was always afraid the lenses would fog up while I was driving and having to carry cleaning solution, take them out of public restrooms, clean them, all of that. So, yeah. Super, super comfortable. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So at this point, Cindy's wearing the S-MAP created lenses and so the S-MAP creates a custom scan of the whole frontal aspect of the eye and we create a SLARO lens off of that and I coin these as SLARO 2.0 lenses. So how do they feel? They feel wonderful. I don't even realize they're on my eye. Very, very comfortable. Yeah. It's good to know. And then your prescription is extremely high, so what would you say in terms of stability of your vision? Does it fluctuate like it did with gas permeable lenses? Oh, very stable. So much better. Just put them in in the morning and they stay in all day. Last thing to come out at night and it's been fabulous. Just to kind of get my life back to know I could see clearly all day. All right.

I had a hard time after a while focusing on, like, spreadsheets, for example. I would get headaches, and honestly, I would avoid some of that close work. Yeah, I know, it's not comfortable, especially when we're on the computer for so many hours a day, or a computer, and we're staring at our phones now, too, and so when we think about the NeuroLens, is there a prescribe specifically just for the computer to wear over your contacts, and how does it feel now? Great! A lot better. I put them on only when I'm working on the computer, and I'm able to work comfortably for a few hours at a time, and I'm not getting the dry eye and the headaches that I had before. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, these symptoms do come, for some patients, they all come together. Patients will have headaches, or dryness specifically is a big one. For some patients, they have dry eye symptoms, but their eyes technically aren't dry when we look for signs of dryness, and so sometimes lenses like NeuroLens can ease those symptoms, too.

      "my_row: [188, 5850, \" In this video, we'll go over my opium management decision making and some of the flow charts can be for fairly complicated and the tree-all size has one, but I think we like to, I've got it fairly simple, a simplified thing. And so we'll start with atropine here. Okay. So atropine we order from OSRX and it's at .025 and .05 are the percentages that they offer. You can also prescribe 1% if needed with progresses, with transitions. If we know that both parents have a super high prescription and the kid is progressing at a young age, okay, and their axial lengths are larger than they're supposed to be. The no need to worry about it. Doctors have used it for a long period of time. There's a lot more doctors who are scared about using, above never use it, that have opinions about it, but the doctors that have used 1%. Don't worry about it so much. It just works, right? And so atropine I typically say for children under six years old or as a combination treatment. Usually I tend to have there be more little boys on atropine as opposed to little girls because when it comes to little girls they tend to be a little bit more mature and the other options are more available to them. Okay. So these are the percentages we never prescribe .01 and then otherwise as combination treatment, we just consider a complex treatment with ortho-k or with soft multifocals if their axial length progression is greater than about maybe .2 millimeters per year, right? Anyone from .1.15, the truth is pretty normal, I sometimes you get .1 to .15, this is probably a upper limit. You shouldn't really be going above .2. And then the next is soft multifocal contact lenses and I as a breed them, abbreviated SMFCLs. And this is for low myopia. The reason why we mentioned low myopia is because when you're creating an ortho-k and you're asked why my why low myopia for this versus why not just fit them in ortho-k, you're trying to create a certain amount of plus in the pupil. And the thing is is that when you're trying to displace the tissue central, you're trying to displace the central tissue to the paressential area, the red ring, when the prescription is not that low there's actually not that much tissue displacement. So it's a little tough creating all that much plus in the pupil. Most doctors do mention that they still have done it, but I still like to play it safe. I don't, when it comes to wave, you can sort of calculate how much plus you're going to anticipate putting in the pupil and when it comes to low myopia designs, the numbers don't pan out. So I'd still prefer for the young prescriptions for the young kids to wear the soft multifocal and then when they do, I mean ultimately they'll still progress a little bit once they get into the .1.50s or so .1.25, .1.50, then you can switch them over to ortho-k. It's also a great option for parents who are hesitant about ortho-k. Some parents definitely do see the benefits and some patients, even though it's FDA-approved, they get a little bit nervous about sleeping in lenses, even though you explain to them exactly that you're only sleeping in the lenses, you're not, you're not supposed to sleep in normal soft contacts because typically if you're sleeping in them, that meant that you've been wearing them all day long. And that's not the case with ortho-k, but it works well as a bridge. And so again, soft multifocal scan also be used with atropane as well. If actually like there's not under good control. Normally I would start with natural view one day multifocal, unless the parent comes to a specifically mentioning my site one day. The main difference is that the my site one day, since they're the only ones that have the FDA approval for a soft contact, they actually charge a lot more for it. And the natural view tends to work better. It has higher parameters if it's needed and the amount of plus up that's generated out in the periphery is actually quite high. And this pans out even, you can tell for adults to, the adults tend to do a bit better when it comes to the natural view types of designs. As opposed to the standard, Coopervision, Biophinity, Proclear types of multifocal, right? And so for the kids, they get the same amount of higher plus out in the periphery. And then when it comes to ortho-k, well that's a typo. That's for greater than one doctor in myopia. So you don't want to 125 or 150 or so. If both eyes are 125 and I'll still suggest it, or if one eyes ones, the other ones one 50, then I'll still consider ortho case. At that point, it's just simpler. Or if they have more cylinder than that. When we design it custom we can actually knock out vast majority of the sill. Very rare, do I recall having patients still have sill presenting. Even patients tend to forward out there's a sill. non-custom designs, right, that were the sill typically normally knocks down about half or so. When his customer really does take care of it because of our G-SIM designs, most standard non-custom lenses are arse and unless you go with something like dual-axis or one not. So even then the G-SIMs are more complicated than the dual-axis lenses. And then ortho-k works better for patients who or parents that have had lacic. For their kids they understand it's almost like a form of lacic. It's protective. And so when it comes to all the treatments, that's basically what we have here. And I think it'll get more complicated as we have more treatment options available to us as spectacle lenses come out. But right now it's basically I imagine really young kids and then kind of in between. This is for the best majority of the kids that we're going to meet. It definitely has more of the appeal because they can see clear without having to wear glasses, right. And so we're alternatively both of these, either one of these combined with that chipping.\", 'Doc-MyopiaDesignMaking.mp4', None]\n",
      "my_row: [189, 4074, \" In this video, I'm going to be giving an introduction into how we use our text messaging service company called Weeb. So the first thing how to access Weeb, we'll go ahead and on the task bar here, we'll see this blue icon. And if we hover over it, it will say Weeb. So we can go ahead and double click on that. Once that loads up, you will be prompted to type in your username and password here. And you can go ahead and hit login. And this is the screen that is going to show up when you first open Weeb. So as you can see here, we have a phone button, a messaging button, and a payments button. These are the three most common areas of Weeb that we use. So if I click into this phone button here, you can see all of the phone calls that was made and by which person, it was made by you can also see if we have any missed calls, you can also see the patient name or the phone number, completely missed a call from. Also on this tab here, if we do need to call a patient, you can go ahead and hit this patient icon here. And this will give you a list of all of our patients in our Weeb database. And so you can either search that way or you can type in the patient's name over here. For the messages button here, this is how you will see where you will see all of our text messages that patients have sent to us and that we send to patients as well. And so if you notice here, there is an actionable tab versus an all tab. The all tab here will show all of the messages here from patients. And these have already either been answered or have been taken care of. Which is why it's in the all tab. If we click into actionable, we can see here that we do have some messages that patients have sent to us, but we have not yet responded back to them. So if you hover over the yellow each of the icons here, you can see this yellow dot means the message has not been responded to. If we scroll down. We'll see here a red dot and this message, this icon here indicate that the message failed to send. So if we click into this patient, you can see the red means that this patient has opted out of text. So we will no longer be able to send text to them. And if you do need to message a specific patient, again, you can type in the patient's name here. And you can see all of the message thread that was happening with this patient. Another common feature that we use on weave is this payment button right here. And so this is when we have a patient who we are sending them a text to pay or a secure link. When they are unable to be in office, we can send them a secure link through weave here. So we can go ahead and we can scroll and look for the particular patient that we need to send the text to pay to or we can type their name here. Once you have the correct patient, you'll see this screen here with the active request amount. And so if we wanted to put a new amount, we can just type that here. And from here, we can either take payment with the terminal, which is our clover or we can send them a text to pay. And so once you click that, this is what the message will look like. So say hi, this is Lumen reminding you of your balance. Please use this secure link to pay. And then once you have that, you can go ahead and hit set. It will show you a prompt to show you a preview of the message just so that you can ensure that everything is imported correctly and the payment is the correct amount. So once that is correct, you can go ahead and click got it. And you can see here if we go back to our messages, this is what the payment will look like. The text will look like for the patient to complete payment. And so if we want to check on the status update of a payment, we can go ahead and click payment the three dots here, which will bring us to payment history. And here we can see all of the text to pay that we have sent off to different patients. So here you can see all these people have paid. And these are still open text to pay, meaning that the patient has not yet opened the link to complete payment.
