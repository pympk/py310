Due to my eye condition I have to get scleral lenses. It was the easiest and most professional staff to work with. I am really happy with the turn out and HIGHLY recommend them if you need scleral lenses.Virginia L.We have been going to Lumen for a couple of years now.  Everyone is fantastic!!!  My husband and I both have the Neurolens glasses and our headaches have decreased by at least 90%.  Dr. Eric To is great, he takes the time to explain everything during the examination and answers all of your questionsK.G.Our experience has always been a positive one. I didn\\'t think my insurance covered vision but the front desk staff encouraged me to at least let them check.   They saved me hundreds of dollars! Great addition to Sierra Madre!DrewThe staff here is the best staff I have ever interacted with in the medical industry, hands down. They are extremely knowledgeable, professional, excellent at communicating, and super prompt. They are also so quick to reply via email and they even text. That is seriously so impressive. Tramanh N.Dr. Eric To covered many aspects of the eye that I had never experienced.  His office uses several eye equipment that looks into different parts of the eye that resulted in my rx glasses being made the best rx glasses I\\'ve ever had - and I\\'ve been seeing eye doctors for nearly two decades.Noemi S.Dr. To saved my quality of life- no exaggeration. I thought I was losing my vision, and I had so much pain. He figured out what two other doctors could not. I could not be more thankful he helped me. Thank you, thank you. From, Your Former Neurolens SkepticLeslie G.Clean and efficient office with friendly staff. It was my first time getting glasses and Dr. To was friendly and very helpful in explaining my options.Jordan RMy favorite place to go get my eyes checked!
