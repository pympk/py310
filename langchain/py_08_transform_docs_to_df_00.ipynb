Candidacy Our Technology Frequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens Exams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID 19 Protocols Videos About Us Office Testimonials Blog 3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked Blog AMD Awareness Month 3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked February 3, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Age related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in adults aged 50 and older. Given its complexity, it’s essential to understand the facts about the condition rather than believing the common myths often shared online or by friends and family. Knowing more about AMD can help you take steps to prevent or delay its progression, so here are statements you can overlook to maintain your vision for years to come. Myth #1: AMD Is a Disease That Only Affects Older Adults AMD is an eye condition caused by deterioration in part of the retina, called the macula. This area at the back of your eye helps you see things with sharp detail and color when looking straight ahead for example, when reading or driving a car but it does not affect peripheral vision like looking out into the distance around you. While researchers are still working to understand what causes this macular degeneration, it’s likely due to age combined with other risk factors such as smoking, obesity and genetics. Who is at risk of AMD? People over age 50 have an increased risk of developing early stages of this condition; however, younger people may also be diagnosed if they have certain genetic mutations associated with these conditions. Myth #2: There Is No Cure for AMD Though there currently isn’t a cure for late stage AMD, treatments are available depending on which type has been diagnosed. Dry AMD has no treatment yet, but recent studies indicate that some dietary changes may slow its progression. Lifestyle changes that can help include eating leafy green vegetables rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, as well as omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oil might reduce inflammation throughout your body, including within your eyes. Similarly, maintaining good overall health by exercising regularly, eating healthy foods, quitting smoking and protecting yourself from UV light will help lower ocular inflammation. Myth #3 All Vision Loss From MDM Is Irreversible Treatments such as intravitreal injections of anti vascular endothelial growth factor medications and photodynamic therapy can help improve vision in some cases. Other treatments such as laser therapy, vitrectomy, cataract surgery and low vision aids can also help reduce AMD’s effects. Early diagnosis and management are key to preserving your sight longer with AMD. Time to Get Checked If you are over 50 or have any other risk factors for developing AMD, you should get an eye exam with your doctor. If you live in the Sierra Madre area, Lumen Optometric can provide comprehensive eye exams to help detect AMD early and offer recommendations for treatment and management. We also provide other ophthalmologic services and products, such as contact lenses and orthokeratology. Call us today at to schedule an appointment.

There is NO scientific evidence to support the claims that contact lens wear is unhealthy during these times. For the vast majority of contact lens wearers, their contact lenses are inserted and removed at home, with no manipulation throughout the day. When worn properly, contact lenses are cleaned or disposed of on a daily basis. In contrast, glasses typically are not disinfected every day!

That’s why millions of people wear these lenses for several hours on a daily basis. However, despite being a common device used to correct vision, it’s not unusual for some contact lens wearers to forget a thing or two about contact lens safety. Generally, contact lenses are safe when they are worn responsibly and cared for properly. Whether you are new to wearing contacts or you have been a long time contact lens wearer, make sure that you follow these 10 important rules listed by neurons treatment expert Lumen Optometric. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses. Closing your eyes while wearing your lenses reduces oxygen and makes the surface of your eye more vulnerable to infection.Don’t wear your contacts when you are in the shower, swimming pool, ocean, or hot tub. Tap water, seawater, and the water from lakes, rivers, and pools harbor organisms that can cause an eye infection.Have your contact lenses fitted by a qualified eye care professional. And make sure to follow their instruction on when to replace your contacts. Using lenses for longer than the manufacturer’s recommendation will increase your risk for eye infection as protein buildup could occur. If you are also using dry eye treatment, ask your doctor about precautions on wearing contacts, if any.Always use fresh contact lens solutions every time you store your contact lenses in their case. Never reuse solution or top off old solution since the disinfecting ability of the old solution is already gone.Never use saline water for disinfecting or cleaning your contact lenses. Saline solution is just sterile saltwater, so it has no ability to clean or disinfect contacts.Wash your hands with soap and water before touching your contact lenses. Make sure to completely rinse and dry your hands.Clean your contact lens case using a multipurpose contact lens solution. Let it dry during the day and make sure to replace it every month.Check your contact lenses for tears or chips. Although these lenses are soft, a tear or a chip can still scratch your eye. It’s best to discard your lenses if they have been damaged.Discard your lenses if they land on the floor or in the sink.If you are using reusable lenses, make sure to rub the lenses with a multipurpose contact lens solution. This will help remove debris or protein buildup. Lumen Optometric Need to consult a scleral optometrist? Visit Lumen Optometric to get excellent and personalized eye care services.

The obvious benefits of fresh air and physical exercise aren’t the only perks for kids who play outdoors. Recent research shows that increased “sun time” can actually slow down the progression of myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), or even postpone its onset! But First, What Is Myopia and Why Is It Harmful? Myopia is an eye disease that causes the eye to elongate more than it should, resulting in blurry distance vision. It’s caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, two of which are not spending enough time outdoors and doing excessive near work like device use. Many parents aren’t aware that childhood myopia significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration later in life. It’s been shown that higher myopia is associated with a greater risk of eye disease. That’s why it’s important to stop myopia in its tracks with myopia management. 3 Reasons Why Outdoor Play Benefits Your Child’s Eyes Whether your child is currently nearsighted or not, spending time outdoors in the sunshine can help delay the onset of myopia or slow its progression. 1\\\\. The Brightness of the Sun The sun’s visible light is significantly brighter than the lighting in almost any indoor setting, which may play a major role in controlling myopia. Studies have shown that when sunlight comes in contact with the retina, it causes the release of dopamine into the eye. This may prevent the eye from elongating. Preventing the eye from growing too long is the main goal of myopia management. What is certain: children who spend at least 2 3 hours playing outdoors in the sunshine progress less rapidly than children who spend almost all their time indoors. 2\\\\. Long Distance Focusing It is well established that prolonged near activities like reading and screen time contribute to myopia onset and progression. It’s no surprise that studies now show COVID 19 confinement may have caused higher rates of myopia in children as well. Spending time outdoors, on the other hand, encourages your child to focus on distant objects like trees, basketball hoops, a ball flying through the air anything that’s more than an arm’s length away. 3\\\\. Vitamin D Vitamin D helps smooth muscle tissue around the eye’s crystalline lens allowing it to function properly. This smooth muscle helps focus light on the retina, and may also help maintain the proper eye shape and length between the lens and the retina, which can become distorted as a child’s eyes grow with every passing year. Moreover, the sun’s invisible UVB light triggers Vitamin D production. Some studies have found that nearsighted individuals have lower levels of Vitamin D than those with normal vision. However, more research is needed to solidify this claim, as only small scale studies have been performed. The recommended time for daily outdoor play is at least 2 hours for children over the age of 6. Be sure to send your child outside with a water bottle, sun hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.

The more you know about workplace eye safety, the better you can protect your eyes and the longer you can enjoy clearer and healthier vision. Lumen Optometric, the area’s leading specialist in corneal reshaping and other eye care services, shares some of the things you can do to protect your eyes in the workplace. 1\\\\. Wear the necessary eye protection. Those whose career is in construction work, engineering and landscaping tend to be more at risk of eye related injuries. If you belong to any of these fields, make sure that you always wear the applicable eye protection. Doing so not only keeps you safe but also ensures you’ll be able to carry out your tasks in a more efficient manner. 2\\\\. Reduce exposure to blue light. People working in construction, engineering, and other physically demanding jobs run the risk of developing eye problems, but this doesn’t mean those working in the office aren’t exempt. Staring in front of a computer screen can make office employees more prone to digital eye strain. Its symptoms may include headaches, fatigue, dry and watery eyes, and blurred vision. If you’re experiencing these yourself, schedule a consultation with a premier eye exam doctor like Lumen Optometric promptly. You can also take steps to lower your eyes’ exposure to blue light. Using an anti glare screen on your computer can help. You may also adjust screen brightness or position the monitor in such a way that it’s not directly facing a bright light source. 3\\\\. Follow the 20 20 20 rule. For every 20 minutes of screentime, take a 20 second break and look at an object 20 feet away. You don’t even need to stay seated as you do this. How about taking a quick stroll around the workplace to give your eyes a much needed rest?

By limiting your child’s screen time, you help your child to experience the many benefits. As a parent, you should be mindful of how much time your child spends on devices. You might be wondering, how can a parent help in preventing eye diseases in their children? Well, it all starts with limiting screen time. Here are several ways for you to do just that. Set Expectations The first step to limiting your child’s screen time is to let them know what you expect. Set clear expectations early on, explaining why you are limiting their screen time and why it’s important for them to spend more time playing outside or reading books. If they have concerns or questions about limiting their screen time, listen and address them before setting the limit so that they understand why it is important to follow these rules. You can even make a deal with your child: if they spend 30 minutes doing something other than using screens, then they can watch TV or play video games for 30 minutes afterward (or whatever works best). However, don’t give in to demands be consistent! Set a Timer Setting a timer is an effective way to limit your child’s screen time. Not only will it remind them when their allotted time is up, but it can also help them keep track of how much time they’ve spent on various activities as well. You can choose from several apps that are available for download onto your smartphone; or if you prefer, there are physical timers out there as well (like ones with bells). If using an app, simply select the length of time that you want your child to spend looking at screens and set the alarm accordingly. Once this is done, you can set up notifications to alert you every hour so that if anything goes wrong or if any inappropriate material is being viewed you’ll know about it right away. Create a “Tech Free” Zone in Your Home You can create a “tech free” zone in your home by choosing a room or space that is free of all screens and then putting them there. This could be your child’s bedroom, or it could be a quiet spot in the house where you can enjoy each other’s company without distractions. This will allow everyone to relax and disconnect from technology while they’re at home, which may help prevent screen time overload and overstimulation when using technology later on. Lead by Example The most effective way to control your child’s screen time is by monitoring your own usage as well. While it is important to set limits for your child, you need to be aware of how much time you are spending in front of a screen as well. Children will often mimic their parents, so if you want them to cut back on their own screen time, then it’s best for parents to do the same thing first. Choose Treehouse Eyes For Better Vision It’s important for your child to develop social skills and human interaction. You can’t do this if they’re glued to their screens. It also helps them learn how to manage their distractions, which is an important life skill that will help them get through things like school and work.

To ensure that your child can do well in class, you will need to manage their refractive error. This usually means going to a trusted local eye doctor for prescription eyeglasses. But not every child wants to wear eyeglasses, especially those who are active in sports and other physical activities. This makes contact lenses a more attractive option, but is your child actually ready for them? Lumen Optometric, the leading eyecare provider in the area, shares how you can know. 1\\\\. Your child is asking if they can wear them. The decision to wear contact lenses will depend on the child. If wearing eyeglasses makes them unhappy and uncomfortable, then they will be far more motivated to take good care of their contact lenses. 2\\\\. They make an effort to be clean and hygienic. Proper use and care of contact lenses is a big responsibility. Cleanliness should always be observed to ensure safety and comfort and to prevent infections and other eye problems. If your child knows the importance of cleanliness and makes an effort to practice good hygiene, then they should be ready to wear contacts. 3\\\\. Your child does their chores without being asked repeatedly. A certain amount of discipline is required on the part of the child when it comes to contact lens use. The proper cleaning and storage of contact lenses are akin to doing household chores. When they don’t need to be told twice about what needs to be done, then they’re already a good candidate for contact lenses. 4\\\\. They are active in sports. Eyeglasses get in the way of your child’s athletic interests. By letting them wear contacts, they can maximize their potential in sports, allowing them to perform well while enjoying clearer vision.

One of these problems is diabetic eye disease, which can severely damage your vision. Diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the conditions that result from this disease. Fortunately, Lumen Optometric is here to share four steps you can take to prevent or slow down diabetic eye disease. 1\\\\. Undergo a Dilated Eye Exam Annually Diabetic patients are highly advised to visit a dilated eye exam doctor at least once a year. In this assessment, your ophthalmologist will identify early signs that diabetes is affecting your eyesight. Typically, diabetic eye diseases only show a few symptoms until the condition has advanced. If your vision starts to blur due to diabetes, consult a professional immediately to determine the best treatment for you and save you from irreversible vision loss. 2\\\\. Manage Your Blood Sugar Keep your blood sugar level in your target range by eating food that is low in sugar and carbohydrates, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood sugar. For personalized assistance, consult a primary care physician, an endocrinologist or a nutritionist. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor. 3\\\\. Control Your Blood Pressure Managing blood pressure can protect your eyes from diabetic retinopathy, which is a complication of diabetes that damages the retina. If your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are high, your tiny fragile blood vessels would react negatively, resulting in serious eye damage. In the event that your eye condition has worsened, call your eye doctor right away for corneal reshaping or other treatments. 4\\\\. Maintain an Active and Healthy Lifestyle A balanced diet and regular exercise can help control your diabetes, which can benefit your eye health. As much as possible, avoid consuming processed and fried food, an excessive amount of red meat, high sugar beverages, and food with refined carbohydrates. For a hassle free mealtime, you can ask your diabetic care team to create a meal plan that works for you and provides you with enough energy to maintain an active lifestyle. For outstanding diabetic eye care, you can rely on us at Lumen Optometric. We provide comprehensive eye examinations, contact lenses and other optical solutions.

Besides giving you the ability to see, they let you learn new skills and interact with others. Taking good care of your eyes goes a long way in maintaining good vision and avoiding sight threatening conditions. A local orthokeratology specialist gives five tips to keep your eyes healthy. 1\\\\. Schedule Regular Eye Exams Routine comprehensive eye exams help diagnose various eye conditions in their early stages, including glaucoma, cataracts and age related eye conditions. Sometimes, they also allow specialists to catch signs of other health problems, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. How often you need to get your eyes checked typically depends on your age and family history of eye disease. You may need to visit an eye exam doctor more frequently if you have an existing medical condition. 2\\\\. Keep Your Eye Prescription Up to Date Frequent headaches, constant squinting and blurred vision are common signs you need to update your prescription eyewear. If you feel relief when you remove your glasses, it definitely means you need a new pair. Moreover, experts recommend getting new corrective eyeglasses every two years. 3\\\\. Protect Your Eyes From the Sun Your eyes are just as susceptible to sun damage as your skin. When heading outdoors, be sure to wear UV blocking sunglasses. Wearing a wide brimmed hat is another thing you can do to protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays. 4\\\\. Maintain a Healthy Diet Eating well balanced meals will benefit your eyes and overall well being. Incorporate foods high in zinc, omega 3 fatty acids, and vitamins A, C, and E into your diet. Leafy greens, nuts, fish, and colorful fruits and vegetables are especially rich in these nutrients. 5\\\\. Stay Hydrated Your eyes could suffer if you don’t drink enough water. Blurred vision, eye fatigue and a stinging sensation in the eyes are typical signs of dehydration. Drink at least eight glasses of water daily to hydrate your eyes and body. Don’t wait before you experience significant changes in your vision before seeing an eye doctor. Lumen Optometric is here to handle your eye care needs.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at Lumen Optometric share daily habits that can benefit your eyes and vision. 1\\\\. Wash Your Hands Thanks to recent events, hand washing should already be part of your daily routine coming from the outdoors. Even if you stay indoors most of the time, you should wash your hands regularly. Common vision related diseases like conjunctivitis (pink eye) are caused by touching in or around the eyes with unclean hands. 2\\\\. Wear Eye Protection Whether you’re mowing the lawn, doing some woodwork in your workshop, or performing home repairs, don’t risk eye injury and always wear eye protection. Protective glasses are easy to obtain, comes in many sizes, and can be worn over existing eyeglasses. If you’re working on anything that involves welding, make sure to wear a welding mask or goggles. 3\\\\. Handle Your Contact Lenses Carefully Your contact lenses come into direct contact with your eyes; you’ll definitely want to keep them clean. Always make sure that you’re handling them with clean hands, keep your contact lens cases sterilized, and discard expired contact lens solution. If you’re undergoing dry eye treatment, your eye doctor may prescribe a different type of contact lenses, with different handling instructions. Make sure you follow them closely to avoid damage to your eyes. 4\\\\. Maintain a Healthy Diet Eating fast food every day probably won’t make you go blind, but it’s not good for your health, either. Various studies have shown that a diet that contains significant amounts of foods that are rich in Omega 3 and lutein can help reduce the risk of cataracts, night blindness, and other eye problems. 5\\\\. Rest Your Eyes Most of us spend a significant portion of the day staring at computer screens, especially those who work from home. Make sure to rest your eyes every once in a while. The “20 20 20 Rule,” is a good daily practice to turn into a habit. The rule is simple: every 20 minutes, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Doing this several times a day can help reduce eye strain. Lumen Optometric is your leading provider of eye care services, including Neurolens® treatment. Give us a call at .

But how much do you really know about this eye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll explore 5 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about your child’s eye health and long term vision. 1\\\\. Myopia is an Eye Disease Myopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. 2\\\\. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye disease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people worldwide. If things don’t change, half of the world’s population will have some degree of myopia by the year 2050! 3\\\\. It’s a Progressive Condition Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. 4\\\\. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease Myopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight threatening eye diseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50% higher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop cataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults than children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of clear vision a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided their children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic maculopathy fell by 40%. 5\\\\.

In fact, there are many reasons to have them spend time outdoors, not least of which is to protect your child’s vision. Studies show that children who spend time playing outdoors in the sunshine experience less myopia progression than those who stay indoors. Moreover, encouraging more outdoor playtime is important for promoting overall health and wellbeing in your kids. Below we’ll explore some fun outdoor activity ideas to try with your kids and discuss why spending time outdoors may slow a child’s myopia progression or even postpone its onset. 5 Outdoor Activities to Do With Your Kids This Winter 1\\\\. Snow Play If you live in a snowy region, bundle up your kids in warm layers and have them: ● Build a snowman ● Enjoy a snowball fight ● Paint the snow with some food coloring or watercolors ● Make a snow maze ● Build an igloo ● Build snow castles (the same way you would sand castles) ● Make snow angels ● Collect snowflakes during a snow flurry and study their beautiful shapes 2\\\\. Blow Ice Bubbles Kids love playing with and popping bubbles. If temperatures are low enough, they might freeze in mid air! They’ll get a kick out of watching them freeze and possibly catching or popping them. To make your own bubble solution, mix 1 part water with 4 parts dish soap and a few drops of light corn syrup. It’s best to try this activity when winds are calm, as harsh breezes can cause the bubbles to pop before they freeze. Once the bubbles have landed on a surface and are completely frozen, they are beautiful to photograph which can be part 2 of this activity. 3\\\\. Go Sledding Sledding is a classic winter activity that your child will love. To go sledding, all you need is snow, a sled, and a hill! Easy enough. But before you hit the slopes (or hills), be sure to follow these safety guidelines: ● Choose a sled that can be steered and can brake ● Wear a helmet ● Dress warmly, but be careful as the scarf can get caught under the sled ● Children 5 years old and under should sled with an adult 4\\\\. Go on a Winter Scavenger Hunt A winter scavenger hunt is a wonderful way to explore nature with all of your senses. Before you head out, make a list of things to see, smell, listen for, and feel. Ask your child to check each item off the list. For example, your list can include listening for the sounds of birds chirping, footsteps crunching in the leaves, or water babbling in a nearby stream. On the list of things to look for, you can include different types of trees, animals, animal tracks, cloud shapes, birds’ nests, and more. Take your camera along and let your child take pictures of what they find. You can also leave an empty space on the list for your child to fill as they explore new things on their own. 5\\\\. Decorate a Tree with Edible Ornaments For Animals This activity is an unconventional twist on building a bird feeder and perfect for those who live near a forest. The idea is to make edible ornaments and hang them on a tree (or potted plant in your garden) for wildlife to feed on during the winter. Your ornaments can be made using various seeds, peanut butter, dried fruit, and popcorn. It’s best to use biodegradable materials to hang your ornaments, and don’t use fishing lines, as birds can get caught in it. What’s the Connection Between Time Outdoors and Myopia? There is increasing evidence that children who spend extra time daily playing outdoors have a reduced risk of developing myopia; and if they already have myopia, time spent outdoors could slow down the worsening of this condition, also known as myopia progression. These findings are significant, as having myopia significantly increases a child’s risk of developing sight threatening eye diseases later in life. Moderate to high levels of myopia make a child more susceptible to developing cataracts, retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and glaucoma later in life. At Treehouse Eyes, our mission is to battle childhood myopia by providing myopia management to nearsighted children. Our myopia management treatments can effectively slow down your child’s myopia progression and reduce their future risk of eye disease. If your child has myopia, or if you need your first consultation, contact us today to schedule a myopia eye exam. Wishing you and all of our patients a healthy and enjoyable winter season!

This way, your trusted optometrist can detect any conditions or diseases that may trouble them later on. Which eye conditions are these exactly? Lumen Optometric, the trusted eye exam doctor in the area, offers a quick overview of some of them. Refractive Errors These refer to conditions that can cause blurry vision. Refractive errors include farsightedness (hyperopia), when close objects appear distorted, nearsightedness (myopia), when objects viewed at a distance are blurry and astigmatism, when objects both near and far are unclear. They may occur when the cornea doesn’t bend, or refract, light properly. Symptoms include a disinterest in reading or viewing distant objects and squinting or turning the head in an odd fashion when watching television. Children diagnosed with refractive errors can be treated through prescriptive glasses, and even corneal reshaping, or orthokeratology (Ortho K). The latter refers to the use of gas permeable lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia, hyperopia and refractive errors. Ortho K is a safe and effective alternative to eyeglasses, refractive surgery, or contact lenses. Amblyopia Another common eye problem in babies and young children is amblyopia or ‘lazy eye’. This happens when the vision of one or both eyes did not develop properly during childhood, or when eye conditions, such as refractive errors, weren’t corrected promptly. Strabismus Also known as cross eyes, strabismus is when the eyes aren’t aligned properly–instead pointing at different directions. This causes loss of depth perception because the child learns to ignore the image received by the misaligned eye, relying only on the one from the straight, or better seeing eye. Treatment options for strabismus may include eyeglasses and vision therapy. Ptosis When the upper eyelid droops and restricts or blocks vision, this is called ptosis. A child with this condition may tip their head back, lift up their chin, or raise their eyebrows to try to see better, which may cause head or neck problems over time. Visit your local eye doctor for a thorough eye exam if your child exhibits these symptoms. Color Deficiency Also called color blindness, this eye problem makes it difficult for the child to distinguish specific shades of color. This is usually an inherited condition, but there are also certain diseases that can cause color deficits. While there is no cure for color deficiency, there are special glasses and contact lenses your child can wear that allow them to see color differences. To prevent or avoid lasting vision problems for your child, make sure to visit a premier eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a regular eye exam.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at Lumen Optometric shares a quick guide on contact lens solutions. Multipurpose Vs. Hydrogen Peroxide Solutions There are two types of contact lens solutions: multipurpose and hydrogen peroxide based. They serve the same purpose disinfect your contacts and remove debris but they work in different ways. Multipurpose solution, also known as all in one solution, is simple to use. Wash your hands, put your contacts in your palm, then moisten the lenses with the multipurpose solution. While some types of multipurpose solutions are marketed as “no rub” products, experts recommend rubbing the lenses with it for 10 seconds to remove remaining debris. Apply a drop of saline solution in each lense to rinse before wearing it. Hydrogen peroxide solution, on the other hand, requires more time or attention. Unlike multipurpose solutions, this type of contact lens solution does not “spoil,” and is ideal for people who are sensitive to certain chemicals, or for those undergoing therapy like dry eye treatment. Hydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at disinfecting contact lenses, but it must not touch the eye directly. To use it, fill a small case with the solution (most contact lenses come with such a case) and soak them for six to eight hours. Before taking out the contacts, a neutralizer must be applied to turn the hydrogen peroxide to a plain saline solution. Which One Should You Choose? Between the two, the multipurpose solution is the more cost effective and easy to use, and can be used virtually anywhere as long as you have a contact lens case or a clean surface to clean them in. However, it is not as effective at disinfecting contact lenses as the hydrogen peroxide solution. Making it an all in one solution requires certain chemicals that may not be ideal for some people who may be sensitive to certain substances. This also means it has a shorter shelf life. The hydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses, but there is a risk of harming the eye if one were to forget applying the neutralizer. It is also important not to reuse or top off the solution after use. Contact lens cases must also be replaced every one to three months to cut the risk of infection.

But apart from the style of your eyeglass frame, you should also look into the frame materials. Lumen Optometric, a trusted scleral optometrist and eyeglass provider, discusses some of the most popular materials used for eyeglass frames. Titanium Titanium is commonly used in designer glasses. It is an excellent material for eyeglass frames and hinges because it is very lightweight, sturdy, hypoallergenic and corrosion resistant. However, titanium is significantly more expensive than other frame materials. Titanium alloy, which is a combination of titanium and other metals, is typically used as a cheaper alternative to titanium. Stainless Steel Stainless steel is a reliable material for eyeglass materials. It’s durable, strong, hypoallergenic and non corrosive. It may not be as lightweight as other materials, but it can be easily shaped into ultra thin eyewear frames. Stainless steel is also flexible, and this usually adds to the comfort of eyeglass wearers. So whether you are wearing glasses most of the time or you’re only using it temporarily while undergoing dry eye treatment, this type of frame material can be really comfortable for you. Plastic Zyl or propionate is typically used in making the plastic frame material. Zyl, which is also known as cellulose acetate, is the most common type of plastic frame material. Meanwhile, propionate is the second most popular plastic frame material. It is hypoallergenic and nylon based, and it has a different look and feel than other types of plastic. Lumen Optometric has expertise in different kinds of eye care services. Whether you’re considering Neurolens treatment or you’re simply looking for a new pair of glasses, our staff will ensure that your needs are met.

What’s less well known is what these different eye conditions are. Presbyopia is one of these diseases. It’s a condition that usually affects people aged over 40 and makes it harder for their eyes to focus on objects. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing small print, such as text messages, clearly. No need to worry though to help restore your vision, a scleral optometrist will prescribe you multifocal lenses if you’re a good candidate for one. In general, there are three types of multifocal lenses: Bifocal lenses – As the name suggests, bifocal lenses have two prescriptions: the upper lens helps you see objects from afar while the lower lens helps you read and focus on objects near you.Trifocal lenses – Like bifocal lenses, trifocal lenses have upper and lower lenses that help you with distance vision and reading respectively. The difference between the two is that trifocal lenses, as the name suggests, have a middle section that helps you with tasks that require intermediate vision, like using a laptop. Progressive lenses – Progressive lens don’t have the lines found on bifocal or trifocal lenses. That’s because the power of the lenses gradually changes from the top to the bottom. Adjusting to Your New Bifocal Lenses Multifocal lenses will take some getting used to. Here are some tips on adjusting to your new multifocal lenses: Wear your multifocal lenses all the time – You’ll get used to your new multifocal lenses faster if you wear them all the time. Don’t look down while walking or going down the stairs – The lower part of your bifocal lenses makes everything look bigger, so your feet may appear out of focus. If you need to look down while walking, make sure to tilt your head up and look through the upper portion of your multifocal lenses. Make sure your new multifocal eyeglasses fit your face properly – It’s harder to get used to multifocal eyeglasses and lenses if they don’t fit your face properly. For more info about your multifocal lenses, neurolens treatment, and your other treatment options, don’t hesitate to consult your eye doctor. Looking for eye specialists near you?

This assessment is crucial to diagnosing, preventing and treating eye conditions that could lead to vision loss. To help you further understand what dilated eye exams are, Lumen Optometric is here to answer the most commonly asked questions about this process. “What Is a Dilated Eye Exam?” A dilated eye exam involves pupil dilation, which is a simple and painless procedure performed to increase the size of the pupils. This process allows your ophthalmologist to assess the health of your optic nerve and retina. If you are nearsighted or farsighted, your eye doctor will give you dilating eye drops to check vision problems that hinder you from seeing clearly. “What Conditions Can It Detect?” Glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinal detachment and ocular tumor are some of the conditions that can be diagnosed with a dilated eye exam. This procedure provides optimum viewing of the dilated pupil, which allows for the diagnosis and monitoring of the retina. While there are some diseases that can be detected without pupil dilation, a dilated eye exam is still important to ensure an accurate and complete diagnosis. “What Can I Expect During the Exam?” When your eyes are dilated, your vision may be blurry and your eyes may be sensitive to light for a few hours. For your safety, ask a loved one to drive you home from your eye appointment. In case your eye doctor finds refractive errors in your vision, they may provide you with a prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses to help improve your eyesight. At Lumen Optometric, we are committed to providing only the best eye care services to help you take care of your vision problems.

Are you curious about the neurolens treatment and want to learn more? In today’s article, Lumen Optometric answers some frequently asked questions about neurolenses. How Does It Work? The neurolens Measurement test will determine if you are a good candidate for neurolenses. These lenses are the first and only prescription lenses that can help correct the misalignment in a patient’s vision at all distances. Using neurolenses has been found to relieve symptoms like neck pain tension, eyestrain, headaches and eye fatigue. How Often Should I Use It? Your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen Optometric recommends that you wear your neurolenses during all your waking hours for the best results. If this is not possible, then you should at least wear these lenses while doing near work like reading or using a digital device. In general, you should see results with your neurolenses within your first three to seven days of wearing them. Some patients might take longer however, sometimes taking up to three weeks. Does It Still Work If I Use Contacts or If I Have 20 20 Vision? Your new neurolenses incorporate both your regular eyeglasses prescription and your contoured prism prescription. If you prefer wearing contact lenses, then you can order your neurolenses to only use your contoured prism prescription. You’ll just need to wear your neurolenses while wearing your contacts. This also means that people with 20 20 vision can still use neurolenses if they suffer from misalignment.

We meet dozens of parents and children every day who come in for eye exams, myopia treatments and other services. During these visits, we welcome and address questions or concerns that parents have about their child’s eye health. Because certain myopia treatments include contact lens wear, many parents ask whether they’re safe to wear for young children. Here’s what the research says: A recent study, Adverse Event Rates in The Retrospective Cohort Study of Safety of Paediatric Soft Contact Lens Wear: the ReCSS Study, shows that contact lenses for children are just as safe for children as they are for adults. (This study appears in the January 2021 issue of the peer reviewed Journal of Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics.) The study followed 963 children aged 8 to 16 over the course of 1.5 to 3 years (for a combined 2713 years of contact lens wear time) to determine the risk level associated with wearing soft contact lenses. All of the subjects were 13 years of age or under at the time of their first fitting, with more than half of the children fitted with soft contacts at or before the age of 10, on average. The study results indicate that age doesn’t play a role in contact lens safety. In fact, the risks of developing adverse reactions to contact lens wear among children proved to be the same as in adults. According to the study, the rate of inflammatory conditions associated with contact lens wear were less than 1% per year of wear. Multifocal Lenses for One effective method of myopia management includes the use of MiSight daily multifocal soft contact lenses. MiSight contact lenses are FDA approved for the treatment of myopia and have been shown to effectively slow down the rate of myopia progression. Many parents like this method as it requires minimal maintenance; at bedtime, the child discards the pair they are wearing, and inserts a fresh pair in the morning. It also rids the child of the need to wear glasses during the day, allowing them to freely partake in sports and other activities. The myopia management program at Treehouse Eyes can help preserve your child’s gift of sight for a lifetime. Treating your child’s myopia will give them clear vision today, while reducing their chances of developing sight threatening eye diseases later in life. it’s never too early to start treating myopia.

November 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Today, you can have your eyes checked without actually seeing your eye doctor using online vision tests. Many eye clinics offer these tests that you can accomplish via your smartphone. They claim to determine how sharp your vision is, if you have astigmatism, or experiencing eye sensitivity. Discover if online eye tests are any good and when they are useful from a local eye exam doctor. Are Online Eye Tests as Good as Visiting Your Eye Doctor? Typically, an online eye test only checks your visual acuity and gives an estimate of your refractive error. Sometimes, it includes contrast sensitivity and color blindness. However, this kind of test can’t determine if you have conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, or macular degeneration. Keep in mind that routine eye exams with your eye doctor are still irreplaceable. Get your eyes checked as frequently as advised by your eye specialist. Regular comprehensive eye exams can help with the early detection and treatment of different eye conditions, especially those that don’t show symptoms until their later stages. When Are They Helpful? When you’re away, and you break or lose your glasses or contact lenses, that’s when online eye tests are most useful. Sometimes, an online vision test can help keep track of your eyesight and refractive error between routine eye exams. Still, it helps to know that the results of some online eye tests have been validated with limited studies because it’s still a new and developing technology. More studies are required to ensure the accuracy of prescriptions generated by online vision tests. For your family’s eye care needs, turn to Lumen Optometric.

While they are a common, albeit harmless, condition among infants, blocked tear ducts developing in adults may indicate an underlying problem. Lumen Optometric, the trusted scleral optometrist in the area, shares more of the essentials you need to know. What Can Cause Blocked Tear Ducts? There are many different reasons blocked tear ducts can occur. These may develop because of an age related change, when the tiny openings (puncta) that allow tears to drain become narrower, which can cause a blockage. Other common reasons include infection of the eyes, tear duct system, or nasal passages. An injury or trauma can also result in blocked tear ducts. This can be as minor as foreign particles getting lodged in the eyes, or as serious as a blow to the head or a broken nose. What are the Symptoms of Blocked Tear Ducts? Watery eyes and excess tears streaming from the eyes may be signs of a blocked tear duct. But these may be accompanied by: Redness and irritation of the affected eyeCrust forming along the eyelidsExcess mucus or discharge from the eyesEye infections, like pink eye or conjunctivitisPain and inflammation of the inside corner of the eyeBlurred vision You should note, however, that watery eyes due to cold or sinus infection may be unrelated to a blocked tear duct. The same goes for swelling or redness in the eyes, which may be a result of an injury that doesn’t affect the tear ducts. When you’re experiencing some or most of the symptoms mentioned above, you should go see Lumen Optometric, your trusted local eye doctor promptly. We don’t just specialize in dry eye treatment–we can also manage a number of other eye conditions. How Do You Deal with Blocked Tear Ducts? While a blocked tear duct can result in discomfort and swelling, it is almost always correctable. Its treatment will depend on its underlying cause. To accurately pinpoint the reason for your blocked tear ducts, we’ll perform a comprehensive eye examination and, depending on the results, recommend the effective and appropriate solution. Whether you need to deal with blocked tear ducts or considering neurolens treatment, Lumen Optometric has got you covered.

Blog eye care Can Blue Light Glasses Protect Kids From Digital Eye Strain?Can Blue Light Glasses Protect Kids From Digital Eye Strain? January 8, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Today, children are more exposed to digital devices, which makes a lot of parents worry. Using devices like computers, cellphones, and tablets can result in digital eye strain. One of the things that are believed to help prevent the condition is blue light glasses. Find out if blue light glasses can protect children against digital eye strain from a scleral optometrist. Where Does Blue Light Come From? Blue light is visible light with shorter wavelengths but more energy than other light at the other end of the color spectrum. The main source of blue light is the sun but it can also come from your digital devices, LED lights, television screens, and fluorescent lights. Fortunately, there is no known evidence that blue light from screens is damaging to a child’s eyes. Do Blue Light Glasses Work? Kids who spend hours in front of screens are more prone to develop digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome. Among the most common signs of this eye condition are eye fatigue, headaches, shoulder or neck pain, changes in vision, and dry eye. To keep track of your child’s vision and ensure their eyes are healthy, visit your eye doctor regularly. At Lumen Optometric, you can count on us to take care of your child’s eyes. We specialize in myopia treatment, dry eye treatment, and more. Blue light glasses are available in prescription and non prescription lenses. These glasses have a slight yellow tint to the lenses and can help prevent digital eye strain in children. However, these glasses do not completely filter all blue light but they can reduce your child’s exposure by up to at least 80 percent. Still, the best way to prevent this eye condition is limiting your child’s screen time, especially for younger ones. For your family’s eye care needs, Lumen Optometric is here to help. We offer neurolens treatment, scleral lenses, orthokeratology, and more. Call us at or fill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

Let’s explore the efficacy of correcting visual habits in mitigating its advancement. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent ocular condition with multifaceted causes and implications. In this post, we delve into whether myopia can worsen despite corrected visual habits. The Mechanisms of Myopia Occurrence: The journey of myopia onset is intricate and begins before visual symptoms manifest. Research indicates that the eye undergoes accelerated axial growth one to two years before myopia becomes clinically evident. During this period, compensatory mechanisms within the eye attempt to counteract the elongation, including the flattening of the anterior surface of the lens. However, these mechanisms eventually exhaust themselves, leading to the establishment of myopic refractive status an early to mid stage irreversible pathological change. The Influence of Age on Myopia Progression: Understanding the age at which myopia sets in is crucial in predicting its progression. Studies suggest that the earlier myopia occurs and the faster it progresses, the less responsive it is to interventions aimed at improving visual habits. This underscores the importance of early detection and intervention in younger individuals to potentially mitigate the severity of myopia progression. Challenges in Eliminating Causative Visual Habits: While correcting visual habits is a fundamental aspect of managing myopia, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges associated with eliminating causative factors. Factors such as excessive near work, limited outdoor time, and genetic predispositions contribute to myopia development. Despite concerted efforts to modify these habits, complete eradication remains elusive, posing a continued risk for myopia progression. Conclusion : In conclusion, the journey of myopia progression is complex, and influenced by various factors including age, genetic predispositions, and environmental habits. While correcting visual habits is beneficial, it’s crucial to recognize the limitations in eliminating causative factors. Early intervention remains key in potentially slowing down myopia progression, emphasizing the importance of regular eye exams and proactive management strategies. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed to empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources to navigate their myopia journey effectively.

Blog eye care Can Poor Sleeping Habits Affect Your Eyes?Can Poor Sleeping Habits Affect Your Eyes? June 10, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Sleep is crucial to your health and to every part of your body, including your eyes. It ensures that your eyes have enough moisture and rest to perform well. If you are not getting enough sleep, this could affect your eyes and increase your risks of various side effects ranging from mild (dark circles and puffy eyes) to severe (eye infections and vision loss). Lumen Optometric, a trusted provider of contact lenses and eye care services, further discusses the negative impact of poor sleeping habits on your overall eye health. Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Eyes One common but less dangerous effect of poor sleep is having dark circles underneath your eyes. Some people, though, are more prone to having puffy eyes rather than dark circles after a night of inadequate sleep. In other cases, when people are not able to get enough sleep, they experience eye spasms and twitching throughout the day. This often makes it difficult to do work or activities like reading. It can also pose hazards if you are driving. Another usual side effect of sleep deprivation is having strained, dry and itchy eyes the next day. This is a slightly more serious effect of poor sleep. Dry eyes specifically can be painful and it can cause irritation. This is mainly because your eyes are not getting proper lubrication. Lack of sleep may also cause your eyes to be sensitive to light or your vision to be blurry. People who don’t get enough sleep have an increased risk of glaucoma, a condition caused by excessive buildup inside the eye. If you have been experiencing these symptoms more frequently, make sure to visit an eye exam doctor. You should also address the source of your eye symptoms in this case, poor sleeping habits. Tips on Improving Your Sleep Remember that your eyes go through a lot whenever you’re awake. They work several hours a day, so it is important to give them enough time to recover through sleep. If you are having problems getting a good quality of sleep, here are some tips that might help you: Exercise regularly. This can help you sleep better, but make sure to avoid it three hours before your bedtime.Get as much sunlight as you can during the day.As much as possible, avoid exposure to blue light and digital screens at least two hours before bedtime.Consider wearing an eye mask if you get stimulated even by the faintest of lights at night. You can also try blackout blinds to prevent outdoor lights from seeping into your bedroom.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says 90% of these incidents are preventable. Generally, the kind of eye protection you need depends on the potential hazards present in your workplace. A local orthokeratology expert shares some of the most common causes of workplace eye injuries. What Are the Common Causes of Workplace Eye Injuries? Flying Objects Does your job involve sanding, riveting, chiseling, hammering, riveting or machining? If so, you must wear appropriate eye protection like safety glasses, face shields or goggles. These tasks can expose you to small flying objects that can enter your eyes, including metal fragments, wood particles and cement chips. Chemicals You must be careful when working with chemicals because they can cause irreversible eye damage. Proper safety gear will protect your eyes from chemical splashes, fumes and vapors. Gasoline, grease, oil and paint thinner can also harm your eyes. Object or Tool Penetration Permanent eye damage can occur due to the penetration of tools or sharp objects. When this incident happens, seek medical attention immediately. Always wear safety glasses and avoid tools you have no experience using. Radiation Lasers and welding equipment can produce high levels of infrared, ultraviolet radiation and heat. Workers need to wear safety goggles when performing tasks involving these tools. Doing so will protect them from eye problems like cataracts, retinal burns and blindness. Which Eye Problems Usually Occur at Work? Digital Eye Strain Many jobs today require you to stare at digital screens for hours. If you spend a significant time in front of a computer, you might experience digital eye strain. Headaches, dry eyes and blurred vision characterize this condition. It can also cause neck and shoulder pain. These symptoms can occur due to glare on screens, poor seating posture and improper viewing distances. Uncorrected refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism can also trigger digital eye strain symptoms. The only way to know if you need prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses is to get an eye exam. Moreover, taking breaks from computer screens and ensuring good lighting will help alleviate eye strain. Eye Infection Usually, eye diseases spread in the workplace through droplets from sneezing or coughing. You might develop an eye infection if you accidentally touch your eyes with contaminated hands. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis occurs from exposure to Staphylococcus species and other bacteria. Its symptoms include eye redness, burning and a sensation of having something inside the eye. Artificial tears, antibiotics and other topical medications are the common treatment options for this eye condition. Regular visits to your eye exam doctor will go a long way in keeping your eyes healthy and maintaining good vision. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care needs.

You may be dealing with what’s known as computer vision syndrome (CVS). An orthokeratology and eyecare expert explores the causes and symptoms of CVS and how this condition can be corrected. Causes and Symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome Extended screen time, a lack of sufficient lighting, poor posture and bad visual habits can lead to computer vision syndrome. Over time, our eyes have a hard time focusing and refocusing on digital screens, causing multiple discomforts. The main symptoms of CVS include difficulty shifting focus, dry or itchy eyes, recurrent headaches, and blurred or double vision. In some cases, it may also cause neck, shoulder, and back pain, creating a ripple effect on your overall well being. Can Computer Vision Syndrome Be Corrected? The good news is that computer vision syndrome can be corrected. It is not a permanent condition, so your vision can improve significantly with the right approach and professional help. Here are just some of the methods that can be employed: Eye Exercises Specific eye exercises can be suggested by your eye exam doctor to alleviate the symptoms of CVS. These exercises can help strengthen your eye muscles and improve your eyes’ ability to focus. Prescription Glasses In some cases, prescription glasses specially designed for computer use may be recommended. These glasses have coatings to reduce glare and block harmful blue light emitted by digital screens. Vision Therapy This is a customized program of visual activities designed to correct specific vision problems and improve visual skills. Vision therapy can help treat CVS by training the eye muscles to reduce strain and improve visual comfort when using screens. Lubricating Eye Drops Dry eye is another symptom of CVS, and you can use lubricating eye drops to combat it. These drops help replenish your eye’s surface and maintain moisture. Environmental Modifications This could include adjusting the lighting in your workspace to reduce glare, positioning your computer screen at an optimal distance and angle, and increasing the font size on your screen to reduce eye strain.

During this appointment, your eye care professional will assess your eyes and determine the most suitable type of contact lenses for your needs. Here’s what you can expect during your contact lens fitting session. Assessment of Your Eye Health and Vision Needs Your eye care professional will begin by reviewing your medical and eye health history. This examination includes a check of visual acuity, an evaluation of eye movements and an examination of the general well being of your eyes to determine whether eye conditions might affect your suitability for wearing contact lenses. Precision Measurements for a Perfect Fit Following the eye health assessment, the optometrist or ophthalmologist will meticulously measure the curvature and diameter of your corneas. These measurements are crucial for determining the correct size and type of contact lenses that will provide the best fit for your eyes, preventing discomfort and potential complications. For instance, scleral lenses are larger than standard contact lenses and rest on the white part of your eye, the sclera. Due to their design, optometrists perform a more detailed fitting process for scleral contact lenses than regular contacts. Tailoring to Your Lifestyle and Preferences Your lifestyle and preferences play a significant role in the recommendation of suitable contact lenses. The eye care professional will take into account factors such as your level of physical activity, preferred wearing schedule and specific vision correction needs. Communicating your preferences ensures personalized recommendations. Follow Up Appointment A follow up appointment is typically scheduled after a week or two to ensure you adapt well to your new contact lenses. Your eye care professional will check for any changes in eye health and may adjust your prescription or lens type if necessary. They can also help you identify issues like dry eyes that could affect lens comfort and recommend dry eye treatment as needed. Contact lens fitting is a comprehensive process that requires professional expertise for the best outcome. Lumen Optometric is a premier eye care provider dedicated to improving your eye health.

Worry not we’re here to clear up all the confusion. Read on as Lumen Optometric explains why, when, and how your contact lenses may impact your examination results. Should You Wear or Not Wear Contact Lenses for an Eye Exam? Eye exams sometimes involve more than just reading a standard eye chart. There can be several tests, each targeting a different aspect of your eye health. The primary concern with leaving your lenses in during the exam is the potential for inaccuracies. Contact lenses can disguise certain eye conditions or changes in your prescription. They might also obscure indications of dry eye, a condition that demands effective treatment early on. As such, it is preferable to take contact lenses out at least two hours before the appointment. Doing so allows your cornea to revert to its natural shape which can be altered by prolonged contact lens wear ensuring a more accurate examination. Discussing Your Contact Lens Concerns During an Eye Examination During your eye exam, be sure to discuss your contact lens experiences with your eye care provider. This way, they can evaluate your eyes with them on and off. For instance, if you mention issues with blurry vision or eye fatigue, they might consider a neurolens treatment, a revolutionary option for correcting misalignments and bringing comfort. Likewise, if you’re a candidate for scleral lenses, they will have a specialized understanding of your contact lens fitting. Lenses should not just correct vision but should also promote overall eye health.

September 1, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Contact lenses offer a safe and effective way to correct poor vision, being especially useful to those who find eyeglasses inconvenient or uncomfortable. But in order to get the most out of your contact lenses, you’ll need to make sure they’re worn properly. Some people, for instance, leave their contact lenses in for too long, which is risky and highly discouraged. Lumen Optometric, the premier eye exam doctor in the area, explains more. Why You Shouldn’t Overwear Contact Lenses Avoid wearing your contact lenses for too long in a day, and you absolutely shouldn’t leave them on when you sleep. Doing so can lead to complications with your eyesight. In fact, prolonged contact lens use may cause the wearer to experience the following symptoms: Inflammation of the cornea, or keratitisRedness and swelling of the conjunctiva, or the transparent skin covering the whites of the eyesEyelid swellingLight sensitivityBlurred visionDry eyesBurning sensation when the contact lens are inserted But How Long Is ‘Too Long’? The period may vary with each patient, but it’s generally recommended that contact lenses are worn for a maximum of 10 12 hours each day. Anything longer than that can put the eyes at risk of infection and discomfort. If you’re using contact lenses for the first time (and don’t have dry, sensitive eyes) your eye care specialist may suggest wearing them for 6 8 hours on that first day. How to Deal With Overwear If you’ve left your contact lenses for too long and are now experiencing adverse effects, the first thing you’ll need to do is visit a trusted eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a comprehensive eye exam and the necessary solution. Our eye specialists will suspend contact lens wear until all the symptoms have been resolved. As your eyes heal, we may suggest switching to a new lens material with higher oxygen permeability, or recommend using daily disposable lenses.

This condition pertains to the clouding of the lens of the eye. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 17.2% of Americans older than 40 have cataracts in one or both eyes. While a common eye condition, many myths still surround cataracts. A local orthokeratology specialist debunks five of them. 1\\\\. Cataracts Only Occur in Older Adults One of the most popular misconceptions about cataracts is that they only occur in older adults. The truth is they can be present at birth. Cataracts can also develop in younger individuals, and some medications can increase your risk for cataracts, such as corticosteroids. 2\\\\. Overusing Your Eyes Can Cause Cataracts How much you use your eyes doesn’t have anything to do with your risk of developing cataracts. However, cataracts can make doing up close work more challenging. While healthy lifestyle changes can’t prevent cataracts, they can slow down the eye condition’s progression. 3\\\\. Eye Drops Can Treat Cataracts No eye drops can prevent or dissolve cataracts. Cataracts are not growths but changes in the structure of the lens. Removing and replacing the affected lens is the only way to treat this eye condition. If you have cataracts, only an eye exam doctor can determine which treatment option suits you. 4\\\\. Cataract Surgery Is Risky Cataract surgery is one of today’s safest procedures, with a success rate of 95%. It’s painless and only takes around 15 to 20 minutes. You can usually leave the hospital a few hours following the surgery. Most patients recover within four weeks, but some notice a significant improvement in their vision a few days after the procedure. 5\\\\. Cataracts Can Go Back Following Surgery Once the affected lens has been replaced, cataracts will not recur. However, some people may experience cloudy vision because the membrane holding the synthetic lens can decline with age. Fortunately, a quick and safe in office laser procedure can address this issue.

However, beware of what is and isn’t true about your eyes. Doing your research and learning the truth can help you better take care of your eyes. A local scleral optometrist debunks some of the most common myths about vision and eye health. Reading in the Dark Is Harmful to Your Eyes Your mom has probably told you that you shouldn’t read in the dark because it will damage your eyes. Reading in low lighting conditions may lead to eye fatigue or a headache but it can’t cause permanent damage. Constantly Wearing Your Glasses Will Weaken Your Eyes Wearing glasses will not make your eyes weak. While some eye conditions will get worse over the years, it doesn’t have anything to do with glasses. Moreover, your glasses are there to help you see better and correct your vision. Using Digital Devices a Lot Is Bad for Your Eyes Using your phone, computer, and other digital devices for an extended period can result in eye fatigue. However, it will not result in nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. To avoid eye strain, make sure you’re taking breaks in between using your devices. It would also help to wear the right eyewear. At Lumen Optometric, we offer neurolens treatment and other vision correction options. Eating Carrots Will Make Your Vision Better Another common myth about your vision is that it will improve by eating carrots. This vegetable is rich in vitamin A, which is necessary for you to maintain good eyesight. However, your body only needs a tiny amount of vitamin A for vision and you can get it from other sources like fish, dairy, darky leafy greens, and bright colored vegetables.

In this blog post, we’ll explore this topic and examine the existing evidence surrounding the relationship between sleep patterns and vision in children and teenagers. The Link Between Sleep Habits and Vision: Currently, there’s a lack of direct clinical trial evidence confirming the precise impact of sleep habits on vision. However, intriguing findings from animal models provide suggestive insights into this connection. Disrupting the overall circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep wake cycles, may potentially influence refractive development in the eye. Understanding the Role of Circadian Rhythm: The eye is a complex organ, with various components operating on their own biological rhythms. These include the cornea, choroid, intraocular pressure, and lens. Disrupting these biological rhythms can affect the rate of eye growth, potentially impacting vision development over time. Indirect Evidence and Myopia Risk: While direct clinical evidence is lacking, indirect evidence from animal models suggests that staying up late and waking up late common habits among children and teenagers may increase the risk of myopia. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent vision condition characterized by difficulty seeing distant objects clearly. Considerations and Caution: It’s essential to interpret these findings with caution and recognize the limitations of extrapolating animal model data to human populations. While suggestive, these findings do not provide definitive answers regarding the impact of sleep habits on vision in children and teenagers. Conclusion: In conclusion, the relationship between sleep habits and vision in children and teenagers remains an area of ongoing research and investigation. While animal model studies suggest a potential link between disrupted circadian rhythms and vision development, direct clinical evidence is needed to confirm these findings in human populations. Fostering healthy sleep habits for children is essential for overall well being, including their vision health. Encouraging consistent sleep schedules and adequate rest may contribute to optimal vision development.

May 8, 2020 by Lumen Optometric It’s not uncommon to feel irritation or scratchiness in our eyes. This sensation is typically associated with dry eye and seasonal allergies, even though the difference between the two is often muddled. This may be due to the fact that both conditions can affect our eyes simultaneously, the symptoms overlapping. Fortunately, with a specific dry eye treatment and simple lifestyle tweaks, your visual issues can still be corrected. What Is Dry Eye? Dry eye is a common problem that is likely to occur after age 50. It is a condition experienced by people who don’t have enough quality tears to lubricate and nourish their eyes. Dry eye can occur due to several causes, including tears not being made properly and tears evaporating too fast. Other patients may have a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, where the glands in the eyelids become clogged, preventing the production of oil found in tears. More than 86% of all patients with dry eye have this condition. Another possible reason for dry eye is ocular misalignment which can be corrected by neurolens treatment. Is It Seasonal Allergies? The symptoms of seasonal allergies can be similar to dry eye, but the indicating sign is itchiness. When the eye is exposed to an allergen like pollen and pet dander, histamines are released, causing the eyes to itch or tear. If seasonal allergies are affecting your eye, taking antihistamine can be quite effective to fight the inflammation. There are other steps you can take to ease your allergy symptoms. Close the windows and doors in your eyes when the pollen count is high outdoors. Use clean mattress covers on your bed to prevent dust mites. Use a dehumidifier in your home when humidity levels are high to prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Wear sunglasses when you’re outside to help keep pollen out of your eyes. When experiencing a severe dry eye, it’s safer not to assume the cause and instead seek out professional advice from an eye doctor or a scleral optometrist. Here at Lumen Optometric, we can expertly determine the cause of your symptoms and prescribe the appropriate treatment plan. Call us today at or fill out this contact form to schedule an appointment.

Read on to discover how sports eyewear can help improve your performance and where you can find personalized eyewear solutions just right for your sport of choice. Benefits of Wearing Sports Eyewear The right sports eyewear can be a game changer in the following ways: Enhancing Visual Performance Stepping up your game begins with seeing the game better. Sports eyewear, whether it’s a simple pair of sports glasses or customized contact lenses, can significantly enhance your ability to focus and see clearly. For every basketball player aiming for the hoop or a tennis player watching out for the incoming serve, better vision equals better performance. Protective Features Beyond improving your vision, another crucial reason to wear sports eyewear is to protect your eyes from potential injuries. High speed sports like hockey or racquetball create numerous opportunities for errant balls or pucks to cause serious harm to your eyes. Protective sports eyewear can guard against these risks and provide peace of mind as you play. Importance of Correct Prescription and Fit Just like the right cleats or a cozy pair of gloves, having the proper prescription and fit for sports eyewear is essential. An incorrect prescription can defeat the purpose of wearing eyewear and hinder your game performance. Similarly, eyewear that doesn’t fit securely can become a distraction or slip off at an inconvenient time. It’s crucial to consult an eye exam doctor to ensure your prescription is up to date and your eyewear fits well. Different Types of Sports Eyewear Depending on the sport, there are many types of eyewear to choose from. Sports Glasses These are excellent for those who require a prescription for their vision but also need the structural robustness to withstand physical sports. Sports glasses typically have reinforced frames and lenses to maintain their shape and performance. Prescription Sports Goggles For those involved in high impact sports, prescription sports goggles offer a higher level of protection. They fit snugly to your face to prevent any foreign objects or harsh sunlight from impairing your vision. Sports Sunglasses For those sunny outdoor games, sports sunglasses not only improve your vision but also shield your eyes from harmful UV rays, helping to prevent long term eye damage. Lumen Optometric: Enhancing Your Sports Performance At Lumen Optometric, we aim to help you find the ideal eyewear for your sporting needs. We offer comprehensive eye exams to ascertain your precise prescription and orthokeratology services for those looking for a lens free solution.

These are often serious and need medical attention. Neurolens treatment specialist Lumen Optometric has shared below what you need to do if you have the following injuries: Embedded Foreign Object If an object, such as a piece of glass or metal, penetrates or enters the globe of the eye and or is sticking out, you’ll need to call for emergency medical help or bring the child to the emergency room as soon as possible. You should also cover the affected eye with a small cup taped in place so that it keeps all pressure off the eye. Make sure to keep your child (and yourself) as calm and comfortable as possible until help arrives. Irritations If your child has dirt, sand, or other foreign bodies on their eye surface, our resident scleral optometrist recommends that you wash your hands thoroughly and examine the eye. Don’t touch, rub, or press the eye itself except by flushing, as other methods can easily scratch the surface, especially the cornea. Next, tilt your child’s head over a basin or sink with the affected eye down and gently pull down the lower lid. Encourage your child to open the eyes as wide as possible, but if it’s an infant or small child, it’s helpful to have a second person hold the child’s eyes open while you flush. Afterward, gently pour a steady stream of lukewarm water from a pitcher or faucet over the eye, and flush for up to 15 minutes. Check the eye every 5 minutes to see if the foreign body has been flushed out. When you need to have your eyes checked by a trusted dry eye treatment expert, don’t hesitate to visit Lumen Optometric.

It can cause damage to your eye’s optic nerve and can lead to permanent vision loss. While there’s still no cure for this condition, early detection and treatment can help slow its progression and prevent vision loss. A neurolens treatment specialist shares essential things you should know about glaucoma. Certain Groups of People Are at Higher Risk All people can get glaucoma but there are groups of individuals who are at higher risk. People over 60, individuals with a family history of glaucoma, diabetes patients, and African Americans over 40 are more likely to develop glaucoma. People with diabetes have twice the risk of getting glaucoma. Glaucoma is also six to eight times more likely to occur in African Americans than whites. Routine Eye Exams Helps With Early Detection and Treatment Seeing your eye doctor regularly can help with the early detection and treatment of glaucoma. Your eye care specialist may prescribe eye drops to keep the condition from progressing. If you are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma, you may need to schedule eye exams more frequently. Whether you need an eye exam or dry eye treatment, Lumen Optometric is here to help. A Healthy Lifestyle Can Help You Avoid Vision Loss Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and eating a nourishing diet can help you avoid glaucoma related vision loss. It will also help to control your blood pressure, maintain a healthy weight, and quit smoking if you do.

It is gas permeable and it creates a saline filled reservoir over your eye’s cornea. Scleral lenses can be used to treat various corneal conditions and they are among the safest and most effective forms of visual correction. To help get satisfactory results and to ensure that your scleral lenses continue to be safe and reliable as you use them, scleral lenses and dry eye treatment expert Lumen Optometric shares some tips below. Know When to Remove Your Lenses Most scleral lens wearers can comfortably wear their lenses for 12 to 14 hours. However, experts recommend taking the lenses off one hour before you go to sleep. Moreover, if your lenses fog throughout the day and you feel like you need to remove them already, don’t hesitate to do so. Typically, fogging occurs as a result of poor alignment of the lens with the eye. In this kind of situation, the lens rocks and causes mucus to form. The mucus then becomes trapped in the saline layer of the lens, which causes the blurry vision. That said, it is important to get the best fit of scleral lenses for your eyes in order to minimize filming or fogging. Rub Lenses After Removing Make sure to rub your lenses after removing them so as to remove surface debris. You can ask your scleral optometrist to demonstrate the proper way of doing this so that you can avoid damaging the lenses. Generally, it is ideal to rub each lens for two to 20 seconds, depending on your care solution. Use a Filling Solution With No Preservatives A preservative free filling solution is the best way to keep your eye’s health at an optimum level. Regular eye drops can cause damage to your eyes and your lenses because these often contain preservatives, so you should avoid using them at all times.

Do you experience these two problems at the same time as well? Is there a way to avoid or lessen their effects? Dry eye treatment experts from Lumen Optometric share some info! Dry Eye and Migraines Studies have been conducted on the theory of dry eye and migraines being involved with one another and worsening the effects of both. A study titled Tear Osmolarity and Subjective Dry Eye Symptoms in Migraine Sufferers was made in 2017 and was made to explore this correlation. Tear osmolarity refers to the amount of salt content in an individual’s tears. Tear osmolarity is a regular test for dry eyes, as the higher the salt content of a person’s tears, the more prone they are to dry eye. In the above mentioned study, they had 34 migraineurs in the research group, and during the observation period, migraine attacks were generally accompanied by dry eye. Additionally, the more frequent the migraine attacks became, their tear osmolarity also increased. To summarize, the study focused on the link between migraines, dry eye, and tear osmolarity. And during the study, when migraines occurred, the effects of dry eye were also observed. And the more migraines with severe pain and discomfort the research subjects experienced, the saltier their tears became, resulting in them becoming more susceptible to dry eye. Dry Eye Treatment Contact lens users are very susceptible to the effects of dry eye, and these lenses need the right amount of lubrication to function comfortably on the surface of the eyes. If you’re someone who uses a contact lens and has been having bouts of dry eye, contacting your scleral optometrist or nearest eye clinic would be the best course of action. If you’re getting dry eye that comes with migraine, lessening the effects of both is possible by getting the proper dry eye prescription and taking standard medications against migraines. Commonly, treatment for dry eye is done by the use of artificial tears, as dry eye happens when your eyes can’t get the right amount of lubrication they need. With eyes that lack the proper amount of lubrication, artificial tears are the optimal way to address dry eye. They are available over the counter and come in the form of liquid, gel, or ointment types. If your eyes are always tearing up and lessening your tear reserves, getting assistance from an eye care clinic and requesting tear duct plugs is a good way to prevent dry eye. Contact Us!

Determining the cause of your eye discomfort can be tricky, and getting the correct diagnosis and treatment to find relief is essential. Continue reading to learn the difference between eye allergies and infections, their symptoms, and when it’s time to seek professional help. Symptoms of Eye Allergies If you’re dealing with an eye allergy, some common symptoms might include itching and redness, as well as watery or teary eyes. Your eyelids may also appear swollen and you could experience sensitivity to light. These symptoms are usually caused by your body’s immune response to allergens, leading to inflammation and discomfort. Symptoms of Eye Infections On the other hand, eye infections often come with different symptoms, such as pain or discomfort in the eye itself. You may notice yellow, green, or bloody discharge and crusting around the eye. Blurry vision or vision loss can be associated with eye infections too, so it’s essential to pay close attention if you notice any of these signs. Causes of Eye Allergies Eye allergies can be triggered by various factors, such as seasonal allergens like pollen and grass or indoor allergens like dust mites and pet dander. Irritants such as smoke, perfume or chemicals can also cause allergic reactions in your eyes, making them feel itchy and uncomfortable. Causes of Eye Infections Eye infections, on the other hand, can arise from bacterial infections (like staphylococcus or streptococcus), viral infections (such as herpes or adenovirus) or even fungal infections (like aspergillus or candida). These types of diseases can be more severe and require immediate attention from a medical professional. Diagnosis and Treatment If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, it’s crucial to consult a professional for a proper diagnosis. At Lumen Optometric, we offer a variety of treatments to address your specific needs. For instance, our Neurolens treatment is an excellent option for those experiencing eye strain and discomfort. If your eyes are feeling chronically dry and irritated, our dry eye treatment can provide much needed relief. If you wear contact lenses, our skilled scleral optometrist can help fit you with the most comfortable lenses possible. Prevention Tips To help prevent eye allergies and infections, it’s essential to practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly. Avoid allergens and irritants as much as possible, and keep your living space clean to minimize exposure to indoor allergens. Regular eye exams and check ups are also crucial to catching any potential issues early on.

Even if your vision seems clear, getting routine eye exams is essential. Many people aren’t even aware of an eye problem until they see an eye specialist. A local scleral optometrist shares why regular eye exams matter even if you have 20 20 vision. Keep Track of Vision Changes You will never know if your vision has changed or if you need to start wearing prescription glasses until you see a specialist. Eye doctors will perform various tests to trace even the slightest changes in your vision. Regardless of age, you should schedule regular eye exams. It will ensure you have the appropriate vision correction eyewear, allowing you to see clearly and comfortably. Your eye doctor can also determine if you need dry eye treatment during your appointment. Early Detection of Vision Threatening Conditions Specialists can catch early signs of sight threatening conditions during comprehensive eye exams. Cataracts, macular degeneration and glaucoma are some eye problems that don’t manifest apparent symptoms until in their later stages. Early detection and treatment are crucial in preserving vision and delaying the progression of these eye conditions. Catch Signs of Other Health Issues Your eyes can say a lot about your overall health. It isn’t uncommon for eye doctors to detect indications of other health issues while assessing their patients’ eyes. If this is the case, they will encourage you to get further assessments from a medical practitioner.

We believe in helping our patients by providing them with the information that they need to safeguard their vision and eye health. We strongly suggest scheduling comprehensive eye exams every one to two years and familiarizing yourself with some of the early signs of eye conditions. In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric discusses the eye symptoms that you shouldn’t ignore. Double Vision If you experience double vision when both of your eyes are open, then it might mean that your eye muscles aren’t aligned properly. Possible causes for this condition can include serious neurological problems, so you need to take this symptom seriously. If you only have double vision in one eye, then you might have an issue related to your retina or a cataract. We recommend scheduling an appointment with us immediately so we can figure out the cause of this problem. Itching and Burning Sensation If you feel an itching and burning sensation in your eyes then you might have a condition called blepharitis. This condition is caused by bacteria or microscopic mites that live on your eyelids. Other possibilities include a painful inflammation of the eyelid’s oil gland, infections, styes, or overexposure to UV rays. As an expert in contact lenses and eye exams, we can figure out the cause of this symptom. Sudden Increase in Floaters If you experience a sudden increase in the number of floaters, then you need to see your eye doctor as soon as possible. This can indicate that the retina and blood vessels have been torn. If you also see flashes of light, then this can be a sign of retinal detachment. Fortunately, eye doctors have a lot of options when it comes to treating this condition. The treatment depends on the location and size of the tear. If you need to schedule an eye exam, then give Lumen Optometric a call. We offer comprehensive eye exams, orthokeratology and other vision care services.

These cleaning materials are made of wood pulp and have roughly textured surfaces that can scratch the lenses of your eyeglasses and can affect the coating on them too. As much as you need to, avoid using the hem or the edge of your clothes in cleaning them as well. Unless your shirt is made purely with cotton, wiping your lenses with it can cause more trouble in the long run. Microfiber cloth is the best material to use when wiping grime, dirt, and other substances off the lenses, as they are designed to do so with great care and efficiency. Handle With Care When performing maintenance and cleaning on your specs, remember to properly handle them. Take them off by holding both sides, and don’t pull them off by using one hand, as this is one of the most common causes of joint snapping for older eyeglasses. Avoid holding them by one of their frame arms, as it can bend your eyeglasses at an awkward angle and can cause fitting issues. If you’re gonna wipe the lenses, hold your eyeglasses by the bridge (the part that goes over your nose) and gently wipe the lenses in a circular motion. If taking care of eyeglasses feels like a hassle for you, you can try having contact lenses prescribed to you instead. Cleaning Solutions Using strong chemical cleaning solutions on the surface of your lenses is not a good idea, as most household cleaning fluids contain ammonia or some other form of strong acids. These can destroy and erode the protective coating over the lenses, and leave minuscule amounts of the chemical on the surface of the lenses that are facing inwards toward your eyes, which can cause irritation and discomfort, or worse, dry eye.

Let’s explore the pros and cons of glasses and contacts to help you make the best choice for your eyes and lifestyle. Advantages of Contact Lenses Contact lenses offer a clear, natural field of view without any obstructions or distortions at the edge of your vision. For those concerned with their appearance, contact lenses won’t block your face or alter your appearance, although some can change your eye color. For athletes and those leading an active lifestyle, contact lenses are the way to go as these are less likely to be dislodged. The range of options available is vast. You can choose daily disposables, weeklies or even monthlies based on your comfort level and lifestyle. Before making your decision, schedule a comprehensive eye exam to identify any specific concerns or determine whether you need to work with a scleral optometrist. Disadvantages of Contact Lenses On the flip side, contact lenses require maintenance. They need to be properly cleaned and stored, which can be time consuming. Some people may even feel discomfort or irritation, especially if they have sensitive eyes. Dry eyes can be a common issue for people considering the switch. Dry eye treatment is available and can greatly ease the transition to contact lenses. You may also want to consider a trial period with contacts before you fully commit to the switch. The risk of eye infections also increases as contacts are directly worn on the eye. On top of that, the recurring expenses for contact lenses and care products can add up, making them an expensive choice in the long run. Make the Switch With Lumen Optometric At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to discuss your options whether you are switching to contact lenses from eyeglasses or need a Neurolens treatment.

Eyesight only refers to the ability a person has to see clearly without any corrective lenses, which varies from person to person and can change over time. Meanwhile, vision is the ability to process what a person sees and it can be improved with practice. Lumen Optometric, the eye center to trust for neurolens treatment, gives more insight on how they differ from each other. Eyesight This is something that takes place in the eye. Light enters through the front of the eye and then an image is created on the retina. If the eye is not perfectly shaped, the image may not focus perfectly on the retina. When this happens, some may wear glasses or contact lenses in order to improve eyesight or clarity of what they see, or in some cases, wear special lenses prescribed by their trusted scleral optometrist. The image of what they see in their eyesight is then transferred to the brain where vision takes place. Vision This takes place in the brain. The brain receives a clear image and then the vision is the process of understanding and analyzing the image. The brain automatically filters the information and determines what information is important and ignores the rest of the information. Vision can be both consciously or subconsciously processed and is affected not only by information coming in but also by what we expect to see due to prior knowledge. How Do They Work Together? Let’s say a child is presented with a picture of a cow. Eyesight is used to see the image clearly, while vision processes what they see and recognizes what the image is. When an eye doctor tells the child that they have 20 20 vision, they’re really saying that their eyesight is fine. While this means the child can see clearly, vision still refers to recognizing the image and whether both their eyes work together to process what they see. So, if the child has never seen a cow before, their vision won’t be able to recognize what the image is.

Having myopia as a child significantly increases the risk of developing sight threatening conditions like macular degeneration,, glaucoma, and retinal detachment later in life. Even children with low levels of myopia have a greater risk of glaucoma and retinal detachment compared to their non myopic counterparts. The good news is that slowing down the progression of myopia can drastically lower the risks of developing eye disease later in life. Innovative products like MiSight 1 day contact lenses help ensure a healthier future for myopic children. As part of the Treehouse Eyes network, we are proud to be one of the first practices in the country to be certified to fit MiSight 1 day contact lenses for myopia treatment, and be part of the Brilliant Futures Program. CooperVision, which manufactures MiSight 1 day lenses, calls Brilliant Futures “the new standard of care” for children with myopia. “It provides inclusive practice, child and parent support to create the optimal environment for compliance, satisfaction, clinical outcomes and long term loyalty, all via a comprehensive management program featuring MiSight 1 day daily disposable contact lenses.” What are MiSight 1 Day Contact Lenses? MiSight 1 day contact lenses are soft lenses that are worn daily and disposed of after each use. A fresh pair of contacts are placed into the eyes every morning to provide the child with crisp and clear vision while also slowing the eye’s elongation the source of progressive myopia. These contacts are safe and easy for children to use since they require almost no maintenance. Four different clinical trials were conducted to study the safety and effectiveness of MiSight lenses over a 3 year span; 135 children between the ages of 8 12 participated in the trials. Those who wore MiSight contacts experienced considerably less myopia progression than those who wore conventional soft contact lenses. MiSight 1 Day Contact Lenses: A Popular Choice CooperVision recently partnered with Sarah Michelle Gellar, a well known American actress, entrepreneur and producer, to help spread awareness about the importance of myopia management and annual eye exams for myopic children. The need for myopia management hit home for Gellar, who is myopic herself and has a child with myopia. “My husband and I are both nearsighted and our myopia has continued to worsen over time. We want our kids to have a chance for better vision and lower their risk for future eye health issues” explains Gellar. While regular eyeglasses or contacts help children see a whiteboard or tennis ball, “MiSight 1 day lenses offer children the benefits of clear vision while slowing myopia progression during their growing years. That is why I am thrilled to be partnering with CooperVision on this campaign,” Gellar says. Moreover, many parents are pleased to learn that MiSight 1 day contact lenses are FDA approved. In November 2019, the lenses received FDA approval to slow myopia progression in children who are 8 12 years old at the time of their first fitting making MiSight 1 day contact lenses the only FDA approved soft contact lenses for myopia management! We Are Proud to Be Part of the Movement In addition to MiSight, our highly trained and experienced doctors can offer other treatment options to manage childhood myopia, including specialized overnight wear contact lenses and prescription eye drops.

GMAC, of which Treehouse Eyes is a member, invited junior racers to the go kart track for an unexpected eye exam before heading out for some fun! A recent survey of parents by the Global Myopia Awareness Coalition found \\u200b\\u200b” half of the parents reported their children spent more than four hours using electronic devices each day during the pandemic, compared to 18% of parents reporting the same behavior prior to the pandemic.” Most children don’t notice anything is wrong with their vision until it starts to really impact their activities. Eye screenings done by a pediatrician are important, but they don’t always pick up on myopia, especially at lower levels. This is why GMAC decided it was more important than ever to raise awareness of myopia and the treatments available. Watch the “Little Kid License” video now: In the same survey mentioned above, GMAC discovered that “ more than 70% of parents believe their pediatrician will flag any issues related to their children’s eyesight and, almost the same amount trust that their child would say something if they had vision issues.” Unfortunately, this is often not the case. But, why is this such an important problem to face? Myopia develops rapidly as children grow. Remember, your child’s eye grows like any other part of their body as they age. Since children are prone to growth spurts, naturally their eyes are as well. Myopia occurs when a child’s eyes grow too fast, leading to blurry distance vision and greater risk for eye diseases later in life. We know the start of the school year is insanely busy with back to school activities along with the everyday obligations of work and life, but it’s now more important than ever to find a provider that understands how to diagnose and treat your child’s myopia. Give your child the tools they need to succeed! To schedule your child’s back to school eye exam, visit book an appointment or to see a list of all providers near you visit Treehouse Eyes today.

Don’t be haunted by an eye infection. If you’d like to obtain decorative lenses for a Halloween costume, make sure to get an eye exam so your eye doctor can give the proper prescription and provide you with information about the proper contact lens cleaning and care. 2\\\\. Get A Prescription For Decorative Lenses The CDC and the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend not to purchase decorative contact lenses from costume shops, online stores, beauty salons, drug stores, flea markets, or anywhere that doesn’t require a prescription. Make sure to see a doctor to get lenses properly fitted, so your child isn’t at risk for vision problems such as eye infections and eye sores which can lead to permanent vision loss. Learn more about decorative lenses here. 3\\\\. Be Mindful Of Makeup Use Halloween makeup can be a fun way to enhance any costume, but it’s essential to not share makeup for the risk of eye infection. Practice good hygiene by taking off all makeup before bed and avoid using old, expired makeup. For eyelash extensions, it’s important to test for lash glue allergies and practice proper hygiene during application. See more about Halloween makeup safety. 4\\\\. Have Fun!

Fortunately, you’re not stuck wearing such lenses, thanks to high index lenses. In today’s post, your local eye exam doctor at Lumen Optometric shares a look at high index lenses. Regular Lenses People suffering from refractive errors nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism choose to wear eyeglasses to correct their vision: it’s easier to wear than contact lenses, not as invasive or costly as an eye operation, and it can be fashionable. Eyeglasses correct refractive errors by compensating for factors such as eye length and the curvature of the cornea and lens, providing good vision. Sometimes a person’s vision may require strong eyeglass prescriptions that require thicker lenses. Most eyeglass wearers are nearsighted, which requires lenses that are thinner at the center than at the edges. The stronger the prescription, the thicker the edges will be, which can result in heavy lenses. This can limit one’s options in terms of eyewear selection, as one may need to stick to thicker frames to hold their lenses. Wearing contact lenses might not be an option for some people. High Index Lenses Many of today’s eye care centers offer high index lenses as an option. They provide the same level of refractive correction as regular lenses but are much thinner. High index lenses offer the following benefits: Thinner and lighter High index lenses have thinner edges even at high power, which opens up a wider selection of frame styles for you. Lighter lenses also make it easy to wear, even for prolonged periods. Aesthetically pleasing One reason why some people dislike wearing glasses is that high power lenses tend to look like the bottom of a soda bottle, colloquially called “Coke bottle glasses,” which makes the eyes look smaller (for nearsighted prescriptions) or larger (for farsighted prescriptions). High index lenses are “aspheric,” that is, less rounded than regular lenses, which means even high power lenses won’t distort your facial features.

January 22, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Your child’s academic performance highly depends on their sight. 80% of learning occurs through vision, meaning eye problems can hinder your little one’s ability to do well in school. Moreover, many young kids aren’t aware they have issues with their vision or don’t complain of symptoms. That’s why regular appointments with your local eye doctor matter. A local scleral optometrist shares how poor vision can affect children’s learning. Difficulty Focusing Myopia or nearsightedness is a common refractive error in children. Individuals with this eye condition can find it difficult to see distant objects. If your child is nearsighted, they might struggle to see the text on the board, which can cause them to lose focus. Their grades could suffer when they can’t concentrate on and understand their teacher’s instructions. If you’ve noticed that your child keeps squinting or holding reading materials too closely to their face, schedule a visit with your eye doctor immediately. Only eye specialists can confirm if they are nearsighted and require prescription glasses. At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to assist with your family’s eye care needs. Aside from contact lenses and glasses, we offer dry eye treatment. Poor Reading Comprehension Vision issues can impact a child’s reading comprehension skills. The eyes must work harmoniously to move across the page, recognize letters and understand the text. It isn’t uncommon for children with vision related learning problems to get confused with similar looking letters, shapes and words because they can’t see the figures properly. Compromised Hand Eye Coordination Several studies have shown that exercise during school days can improve academic performance. If your little one doesn’t like playing outside with other kids or tends to shy away from activities that require distant vision, there’s a chance that they have problems with their sight. Your child won’t be able to enjoy the benefits of physical activity on their cognitive and motor skills if they don’t exercise during the day.

May 11, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Contact lenses are a common option for correcting refractive errors, like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. They can give you a more natural look than eyeglasses and are generally safe to wear as long as you care for them properly. Many first time wearers tend to find it challenging to put in and remove their contacts. Put in and take out your contacts easily using these helpful tips. How to Put in Your Contacts Before handling your contacts, wash and dry your hands. Failing to do so heightens the risk of eye infections and corneal ulcers from bacteria exposure. Wash your hands using soap and warm water to ensure they are clean. Moreover, avoid drying your hands with cloths or towels with lint. Go in front of a mirror and stand on a flat surface. If there’s a sink below you, make sure to plug the drain. To avoid confusion, make it a habit to put in the same lens first. Place your contacts on the tip of your index or middle finger of your dominant hand. Inspect your lenses for scratches or damaged areas. If your lens forms a blow and the edges turn up, it means it’s in the correct position. Hold your upper lid open with your non dominant hand while in front of a mirror, and hold down your lower lid with the ring finger of your dominant hand. It’s now time to put the lens in your eye, which you should do while looking at the ceiling. To allow your lens to get in place, shut your eyes and roll them in a circular motion. Open your eyes and blink a couple of times. Check your eyes in the mirror to see if the contacts are in the center of your eyes. You’ll know your lenses are in the right position if you’re comfortable and seeing clearly. If not, take out the lenses and reinsert them. Repeat the same procedure to your other eye once you’ve successfully put in the first lens. How to Take Them Out Again, make sure your hands are clean and dry before touching your contacts. Remove any leftover contact lens solution from the case and allow them to dry or dry with a clean cloth. Get in front of a mirror and gaze up. Pull your lower lid down using the middle finger of your dominant hand. It helps to take off the same lens first to save yourself from confusion. Gently push the lens down to the white of your eye using the index finger of your dominant hand. Carefully pinch the lens with your index finger’s pads and thumb to take it off your eye. Do the same procedure to remove the lens from your other eye. Need to upgrade your contact lens prescription? Lumen Optometric has options for different vision correction needs.

August 25, 2021 by Lumen Optometric There is nothing wrong with drinking alcohol occasionally or in moderation. However, too much of it can harm various parts of your body, including your eyes. It can also affect your current and future eye health and vision. Continue reading to learn how alcohol affects your eyes and vision from a local scleral optometrist. What Does Alcohol Do to Your Eyes? Moderate drinkers should expect the effects of alcohol to wear off after a while, especially if they take proper care of their bodies after drinking. After going out for drinks with your friends, make sure to drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated. It’s also important to get sufficient rest and sleep. Meanwhile, heavy drinkers are at risk of vision changes and even permanent eye damage. If you drink a lot in a single day, you may experience dizziness and blurry vision. Making heavy drinking a habit is never a good idea because there is a close correlation between the liver and the eyes. Every organ in your body is related, a reason why you should focus on your holistic health. It’s essential to get regular health checks and eye exams to keep track of your overall health. At Lumen Optometric, we offer comprehensive eye exams and dry eye treatment. Excessive Drinking and Your Vision Over time, drinking too much alcohol can cause brain damage. If your brain does not function properly, your vision may also suffer. You may have permanently blurred vision or double vision due to the weakening of eye muscles. When this happens, your reaction time may also decrease. Excessive drinking also compromises your peripheral vision and causes you to develop tunnel vision. This condition can make driving difficult because your eyes can’t react well to headlights. Another thing that alcohol can damage is your ability to distinguish contrast in colors. Moreover, too much drinking may also result in optic neuropathy, migraines, and rapid eye movements. At Lumen Optometric, we’re more than happy to assist with your eye care needs. We offer a wide range of services, including myopia management, orthokeratology, and neurolens treatment. Call us at or fill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

Women are particularly vulnerable to cataracts due to hormonal changes. As of writing this article, the only treatment for cataracts is surgery. During cataract surgery, the doctor will remove the cloudy lens and replace them with an intraocular lens or IOL. The exact cause of cataracts may be unknown, but many experts believe that oxidative stress can damage enzymes and proteins in the eye’s natural lens. As such, the best way to reduce cataract risks is to eat a healthy diet that consists of antioxidant chemicals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Lumen Optometric, a top provider of corneal reshaping services, recommends adding these foods to your everyday menu. Fruits and Vegetables According to research, you need five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day for optimal eye health. Choose organic fruits and vegetables. When eating them as is or adding them as an ingredient for meals, leave the skins on, as they are full of vitamins A, C, and E as well as lutein and zeaxanthin. Fruits and vegetables offer the highest total antioxidant capacity, so be sure to include them in your regular meals. Fish Another way to reduce the risk of cataracts is by eating foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids. This includes seafood such as shrimp, tuna, salmon, and trout. If your eye exam doctor tells you that you are at risk for cataract development, you can slow the progression by eating fish at least twice each week. This way, you nourish your eyes and protect your vision. Whole Grains Having three servings of 100% whole grains daily is a great way to prevent cataracts. This may include amaranth, quinoa, sorghum, or millet. While these grains seem unfamiliar to you, research some recipes and add something new to your diet. In addition to that, you should also read food labels carefully. Avoid white bread and bakery items that may contain refined grains and sugars and select minimally processed items. Nuts and Seeds Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects membranes of eye cells from radical damage. A few foods, including cooking oils, seeds and nuts, are exceptionally rich sources. Preserve the health of your eyes with the help of Lumen Optometric. In addition to comprehensive eye exams, we also provide prescription glasses and contact lenses.

Blog eye care How Long Does My Child Need ?How Long Does My Child Need ? June 1, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Introduction: As parents, one of the key concerns regarding our children’s vision is understanding how long myopia management is necessary. We often wonder when myopia progression might come to a halt and whether interventions are required indefinitely. In this blog post, we’ll explore this question and shed light on the factors influencing the duration of myopia management. Understanding the Age of Myopia Stabilization: A crucial aspect of determining the duration of myopia management is identifying the age at which myopia tends to stop progressing. However, this age can vary significantly among individuals and is influenced by various factors. These factors include the age of myopia onset, the intensity of near work, parental history of myopia, and lifestyle factors. Factors Influencing Myopia Stabilization: The age of myopia onset plays a significant role in predicting when myopia is likely to stabilize. Generally, earlier onset of myopia is associated with a higher likelihood of continued progression into adulthood. Additionally, the intensity of near work, such as prolonged hours spent studying or engaging in screen activities, can impact myopia progression. Parental history of myopia also serves as a crucial indicator. Children with one or both myopic parents are at a higher risk of developing and progressing myopia. These genetic factors contribute to the overall prognosis and duration of myopia management. Understanding Ocular Growth Charts: Ocular growth charts provide valuable insights into the projected age of stabilization for myopia. However, it’s essential to recognize that these projections assume relatively stable visual and lifestyle conditions. In reality, significant changes in visual demand can trigger a second phase of myopia progression even after years of stable presentation. Conclusion: In conclusion, the duration of myopia management for your child depends on various factors, including the age of myopia onset, intensity of near work, parental history of myopia, and lifestyle factors. While ocular growth charts offer insights into the projected age of stabilization, it’s crucial to consider the dynamic nature of myopia progression, especially in response to changes in visual demand.

October 7, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Your eyeglasses or contact lenses may seem like they’re still working perfectly, but they probably aren’t if you’ve had them for a while. In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses how often you should have your eye prescription updated. How Often Should You Update Your Eye Prescription? People have different eye care needs. Some need to have their eye prescription changed annually, while others won’t need to update theirs every three years. If you’ve been keeping up with routine appointments with your eye doctor, you’d already have an idea of how often you should update your eye prescription. Some factors affect how often a person should see their eye exam doctor and have their prescription updated. For many people, age and genetics are two such factors: if you have a family member who needs to update their prescription regularly, chances are you’ll be needing the same. Lifestyle is also another factor. For example, if you have a job that requires constantly facing a screen, eye strain can affect your vision over the long term. Signs That You Need to Update Your Eye Prescription Regular visits to your eye doctor can help determine how often you should update your prescription. The pandemic has made it difficult for people to see their eye doctor, but if you haven’t had an eye exam even before the quarantines began, then you should see one as soon as possible even more so if you’re experiencing one or more of the following: You’re having frequent headaches. Pain behind or around the eyes is a warning sign that your brain is trying to compensate for the change in your vision. While resting your eyes and taking pain medication can provide temporary relief, updating your eye prescription is a better long term solution. You’re often squinting. Squinting can help focus your vision and bring clarity. However, you shouldn’t have to not with an updated eye prescription. You’re having trouble reading signs from a distance. If your daily routine includes tasks that depend on clear vision such as driving, then an outdated prescription may put you at risk.

They occur when the shape of your eye prevents light from focusing correctly on your retina, or the light sensitive tissue layer found in the back of your eye. More than five million Americans suffer from refractive errors, impacting their quality of life. But the good news is that this vision problem can be corrected. The premier optometrist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares a quick overview of different refractive error types and their treatment. 1\\\\. Myopia. Also called ‘nearsightedness’, this particular refractive error makes it hard for people to see far away objects. Myopia happens when the eye is too long in the back, or when there’s a problem with the shape of the cornea (the clear front layer of the eyes) or the lens (the inner part of the eye that helps with focusing). 2\\\\. Hyperopia. To those with hyperopia, or ‘farsightedness”, nearby objects will appear blurry. This refractive error happens when the eyeball grows too short from front to back, or when the cornea or lens has a different shape than normal. Unlike those who suffer from myopia, which may develop in patients between the ages of 6 and 14, people with hyperopia are usually born with this vision problem. 3\\\\. Astigmatism. When a person has astigmatism, they’ll have trouble seeing both far away and nearby objects clearly. This is caused by a differently shaped cornea or lens, which makes light bend differently as it enters the eye. 4\\\\. Presbyopia. This type of refractive error affects middle aged and older adults. Presbyopia is an age related vision problem that makes it hard for people to see things up close because the eye lenses have become harder and less flexible, preventing light from focusing properly on the retina. How Refractive Errors are Treated Before a refractive error can be corrected, it has to be diagnosed accurately during a comprehensive eye exam performed by a trusted eye care professional like Lumen Optometric. Once the vision problem is diagnosed, it may be corrected using prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Myopia and hyperopia may also be fixed without the benefit of eyeglasses or contacts through orthokeratology. This safe, FDA approved and non surgical treatment involves the use of custom lenses that gently reshape the eyes as you sleep. Ask us more about this particular solution and determine whether this will be a viable option for you.

Whether you have a normal eye condition or you have existing eye conditions or a risk for certain eye conditions, the following tips from Neurolens treatment specialist Lumen Optometric will surely help give you peace of mind whenever you need to drive in the evening: Night Driving Glasses If you’re having difficulty driving at night, you can ask your eye care specialist to prescribe special night driving glasses that can help you see better on the road. This type of glasses usually has a yellow tint and anti reflective coating. Also, lenses made with wavefront diagnostic technology can reduce glare, halos, starbursts and other aberrations that can distract your vision. Regular Eye Checkup Make sure to have your eyes checked by a specialist at least once every two years. If you have a significant eye condition or you have trouble with your eyes or vision, you may have to visit your eye doctor more frequently. Don’t hesitate to go for a checkup if you experience vision problems on the road at night. Your doctor may recommend that you take specialized testing, such as an evaluation of your visual field or contrast sensitivity, to determine what’s wrong and what can be done to improve your condition. Also, don’t neglect any treatments prescribed to you. If you need dry eye treatment or treatment of an eye disease, make sure to follow your doctor’s instructions. Other Tips Below are other simple ways to help ensure your safety while driving at night: Always keep your car windows clear so that you can have a good view of the road.Do not drive if you are tired or stressed. Driving requires focus. If you are already exhausted or dealing with several distractions, it would be better to have someone else drive instead.Plan your trips, especially if you will be going on a long drive. As much as possible, stick to roads that you are familiar with and avoid dark, unlighted streets and risky spots.

It does not only strengthen and improve one’s physical abilities; it can also help boost a person’s mental sharpness, emotional health, and social skills. But due to the nature of various kinds of sports, risks of injuries are always present. One example of this is the risk of eye injury. That said, it is important to have the right gear and protective eyewear to keep your eyes safe. This is true for anyone, whether you are wearing glasses or contact lenses or not. By wearing the right eye protection, you can save yourself from eye injuries such as corneal abrasion, detached retina, eye socket fracture, and hyphema. Polycarbonate lenses are usually recommended for protective sports eyewear because they are impact resistant and shatterproof. They are also thinner and lighter than plastic and provide UV protection. Make sure that the polycarbonate lenses that you use meet or exceed the current sport specific ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International standards. In this post, corneal reshaping expert Lumen Optometric shares tips on how you can protect your eyes when playing different sports. Baseball and Softball Use helmet mounted faceguards that are approved by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE). Eye guards like goggles or spectacles are also recommended to minimize injury in case of a ball impact. Sports eye guards should be approved to ASTM F803 19 or the most current standard. Football Use a faceguard with a polycarbonate visor shield. The shield will protect against objects that can potentially penetrate openings in the faceguard grid. Soccer Use sports eye guards that have ASTM F803 19 approval. Basketball Use sports eye guards like goggles or spectacles that are approved to ASTM F803 19. Field Hockey Use sports eye guards that are approved to ASTM F2713 18 or the most current standard.

A dry eye treatment specialist shares some tips here. Preparing Is the First Step The first thing you should do to incorporate good eye care into your active lifestyle is to prepare ahead of time. Get a travel pouch that fits your contacts, solution, gels, etc. Do not forget to pack eye drops that can alleviate itchiness during the hayfever season or dryness caused by heavy air conditioning. Consider Switching to Disposable Contacts Sometimes, using weekly or even monthly contact lenses does not make it easy to live your active lifestyle, especially if preparing travel kits is not your thing. If this is the case, bring up the idea of switching to contact lenses that you can dispose of daily with your optician. However, this might not be a fitting option if you use scleral or other specialty lenses, says a scleral optometrist. Bring Your Sunglasses Overexposure to ultraviolet rays can lead to a host of eye related issues like cataracts or corneal sunburn, so it is important to take the right precautions to safeguard your vision from damage. Having a pair of sunglasses with you during travels is just as essential as having all your eye care accessories. Sure, contact lenses do provide protection against UVA and UVB, but unlike sunglasses, they do not fully cover your eyes including the skin on your lids.

In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses what causes dry eye syndrome, and how you can manage it if it happens to you. What Is Dry Eye Syndrome? Dry eye syndrome is characterized by dryness around the eyes, which may be accompanied by irritation, inflammation, or blurred vision. Anyone can experience these symptoms, however, discomfort is more pronounced for people who wear contact lenses, as lack of moisture increases friction between the eyes and the lenses. Dryness is usually caused by hormone changes, some autoimmune conditions, or damage to the tear glands or the skin around the eyes. Advanced age and certain types of allergies may also contribute to dry eye syndrome. Some types of contact lenses, when worn for long periods, can also cause dryness in the eyes. Managing Dry Eye Syndrome If you’re experiencing symptoms of dry eye syndrome, do not take any medication or try how tos that you may find online. Visit an eye exam doctor to determine its cause and plan treatment. One of the most common treatments for dry eye syndrome is taking lubricating eye drops, which are often prescribed for dryness caused by inefficient tear glands or very low humidity levels. If dryness is determined to be caused by the medication that you’re taking, your eye doctor may require changes to your prescription. Choose the Right Contact Lenses If dryness occurs when you wear your contact lenses, you don’t have to limit its usage or switch to eyeglasses if you’re not comfortable wearing one. The following are other types of contact lenses that are more suitable for people suffering from dry eye syndrome: Soft Contact Lenses These contacts are made of hydrogel, which contains water. Soft contact lenses are typically disposable, however, some manufacturers offer extended wear options that are reusable for up to 30 days. Silicone Based Hydrogel Contact Lenses These are functionally similar to hydrogel based contact lenses, but have better moisture retention. Gas Permeable Contact Lenses These contacts are relatively more rigid, but they let oxygen reach the eye. Orthokeratology contact lenses are made from a similar material.

However, by making a few lifestyle changes, you can lower your risk for these conditions. This Healthy Aging Month, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, shares tips on taking care of your aging eyes. Eat a Balanced Diet Make sure to include in your diet foods rich in eye friendly nutrients, such as Vitamin A (which helps protect the cornea, the surface of your eye) and Vitamin E (which prevent free radicals from damaging proteins in your eyes). Should You Take Supplements? Supplements can help prevent vitamin deficiencies, but they’re not a substitute for a balanced diet. If you’re considering taking supplements, consult your eye doctor. Undergo Routine Eye Exams How often should you have your eyes checked? As a general rule, those aged 40 and above should see their eye doctor at least once a year. What many patients don’t realize is that they don’t usually notice that their vision has deteriorated unless the change is abrupt or significant. That’s because your brain automatically adapts to any changes in your vision, sometimes tricking you into thinking there’s nothing wrong with your vision even though it has already deteriorated. Through routine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect changes in your vision before they significantly affect your lifestyle and prescribe treatment. For instance, they might give you a higher prescription for your contact lenses. Wear Sunglasses Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays can damage your vision and increase your risk for conditions such as cataracts or macular degeneration. To protect your eyes from UV damage, always wear sunglasses while you’re outside. In particular, we recommend wearing sunglasses with a shade of UV 400, which provide nearly 100% protection from UV rays.

That’s why parents are doing whatever they can to help their children successfully transition to the next academic grade. Below, we share our top tips for parents, so they can ensure that their child’s vision is a tool for success in school. 1\\\\. Balance Indoor and Outdoor Time Outdoor play offers numerous benefits, but many children aren’t getting enough of it. Most children spend much of their time indoors, whether in a classroom, at home, or in after school activities. Kids who regularly play outdoors have improved motor skills, feel more independent, and practice important social skills. But the main benefit of “outdoor time” that eye doctors like to focus on is the lower incidence of myopia (where distant objects appear blurry). Numerous studies published in journals like Ophthalmic Research and Review Of Optometry have shown that children who spend 1.5 2.5 hours per day outdoors during the daytime have a reduced risk of becoming myopic or, if they have myopia, it progresses at a slower pace. Sending your kids outside to play every day will help their vision, overall health, and contribute to academic success. 2\\\\. Encourage Your Child To Take Frequent Breaks Once the new school year begins, students are often busy with daily homework, reading assignments, and visually demanding recreational activities like video games. While all of these activities are important, they shouldn’t be done without periodic breathers. Eye strain is a real concern for the many students who spend hours in front of a book or screen and can put a damper on their grades. Minimally, have your child follow the 20 20 20 rule: every 20 minutes they should focus for 20 seconds on an object that’s at least 20 feet away. Even better, encourage slightly longer breaks for a snack in the sun, or a quick walk around the block to allow their eyes to focus on more distant objects. 3\\\\. Have Their Eyes Examined by an Optometrist Whether or not your child wears glasses, yearly eye exams will help ensure healthy visual development. It’s no surprise that children who don’t see well perform at a lower level than their peers. In some cases, young children aren’t even aware that their vision has changed, or they may not be able to verbally express it. At our practice, our eye exams go far beyond the standard vision screenings offered in school. We thoroughly check your child’s eye health and several visual skills, including visual acuity, focusing, tracking and teaming. If your child has myopia we will discuss if they are a candidate for myopia management. Myopia management treatments can slow or stop myopia in children and teens and doing so will minimize their risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life. 4\\\\. Filter Out Blue Light Now, more than ever, children’s eyes are focusing on screens of all shapes and sizes. While science hasn’t yet confirmed the damaging effects of blue light on a child’s eyes, one thing is certain: blue light exposure (especially in the evening) can lead to reduced sleep quality. Good quality sleep is crucial for cognitive and physical development, which is why many parents purchase blue light glasses or utilize blue light filters such as screens and software on devices. Blue light also contributes to digital eye strain, leading to symptoms like eye pain, headaches, blurred vision and dry eyes. If your child uses a tablet, smartphone, or computer before bedtime, speak with us about whether blue light glasses or lens coatings can help. Give your child the tools they need to succeed!

Blog eye care Is It Possible to Prevent Glaucoma?Is It Possible to Prevent Glaucoma? January 17, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Around 80 million people around the world have glaucoma. Interestingly, around half of the individuals with this eye problem aren’t even aware of it. This condition often shows no symptoms in its initial stages. It’s frequently called “sneak of the sight” because when not detected and treated early, it can cause irreversible vision loss. Learn if glaucoma is preventable from your local orthokeratology specialist. What Is Glaucoma? Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve or the nerve in the back of the eye. Its symptoms are usually not noticeable in its early stages. People often only notice changes in their vision once the condition has progressed. The only way to confirm if you have glaucoma is to get a comprehensive eye exam. While it has no cure, early treatment can help preserve your sight. Who Are at Risk? You can get glaucoma, regardless of your ethnicity and age. However, it’s more common in people over 60, African Americans over 60, and those with a family history of glaucoma. If you are at high risk of this eye condition, you might need to see your eye exam doctor every one to two years. Is It Preventable? While glaucoma isn’t preventable, it can be caught early through regular eye exams. Early detection and treatment go a long way in preventing significant or permanent vision loss. Eating nourishing meals has also been proven to be beneficial to eye health. Include leafy greens, colored fruits, berries and vegetables in your diet. Regular exercise can lower eye pressure, which is helpful for people with glaucoma. Even low intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is ideal for glaucoma patients. Quitting smoking and wearing UV blocking sunglasses are other ways to protect your eyes from the effects of this vision threatening eye condition. If you experience sudden vision changes, don’t wait long to schedule an eye exam. At Lumen Optometric, we provide more than prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses.

July 14, 2020 by Lumen Optometric COVID 19 has changed the way people move and interact in public spaces, influencing our personal hygiene and habits. For contact lens wearers, the “new normal” has put a question on their use of contacts. While contact lenses are generally a safe and effective form of vision correction for many people, concerns have grown as to whether it’s OK to continue using these lenses or not amid the pandemic. Since contact lenses are inserted and removed using one’s fingers, wouldn’t this pose a higher risk of coronavirus infection? According to recent research, there is no sufficient evidence suggesting that contact lens wearers have a higher risk of contracting COVID 19. Experts have also emphasized the importance of proper handwashing and good hygiene in order to prevent or reduce such risks. Lumen Optometric, a trusted expert in eye care and dry eye treatment, shares more tips below. Observe Proper Handwashing Before handling your contact lenses, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Afterwards, dry your hands with a clean towel or unused paper towels. If soap and water are not available, you can use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% of alcohol. Regularly Disinfect Contact Lenses Your scleral optometrist will also likely advise you to regularly disinfect your contacts if they are monthly or two week lenses. Make sure to follow the cleaning instructions of the manufacturer or your eye doctor. If you have disposable lenses, get rid of them properly every after use. Discontinue Wearing Contacts and Switch to Glasses if Sick If you are experiencing any COVID 19 symptoms or you have tested positive for COVID 19, it would be best to stop using your contacts and switch to glasses for the meantime. Take note, however, that wearing glasses cannot protect you against COVID 19 or prevent transmissions of the virus. Lumen Optometric is a local practice that offers top notch eye care services.

A myopic eye is one that grows too long front to back. We know this because we measure it using special equipment that calculates the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length, and with advanced equipment we can now measure this down to fractions of a millimeter. So myopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye – if a normal eye is shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye would more resemble a football. Portrait of boy working on team project in art class Once an eye is too long, there are currently no known treatments or cures which can cause the axial length of the eye to reverse. Refractive surgery performed on adults, such as LASIK, does not “shrink” the eye, but rather reshapes the front surface of the cornea to enable clear vision without corrective lenses. While the patient who has successful refractive surgery can now see clearly, they still have an elongated eye, so still have the risks associated with the disease. The Dangers of Having Myopia There are different types of myopia as well. If a child develops myopia at a young age, we know that they are at higher risk to develop high myopia and even pathological levels of myopia. High levels of myopia can lead to an increased risk for diseases of the eye such as retinal detachments, glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy. Unfortunately, those diseases can all lead to permanent vision loss. These life altering diseases are another layer of danger besides the obvious need for optical correction in glasses or contact lenses in order to see clearly. When you have pathological or degenerative myopia, other signs can form on your eyes that your eye doctor needs to monitor over time. Lattice degeneration and lacquer cracks of the retina all show signs that the retina is under duress because the eyeball has grown excessively long. Ask your doctor about these signs and other ones such as a tilted optic nerve head disc and choroidal neovascularization that happen exponentially higher in cases of extremely high levels of myopia. What are the Best Ways to Treat Myopia? The best treatment is to first prevent myopia if possible. More research is being conducted in this area, but as a general rule, eye doctors are encouraging at least two hours of outdoor activity per day. More outdoor activities under natural sunlight have been associated with a lower risk of developing myopia in the first place. If your children have to do intense studying or reading, it is recommended to do as much reading as possible when the sun has set versus reading during the day. Regular checkups with your eye doctor to diagnose myopia as early as possible are also critical. By catching myopia at an early age, there can be many different types of interventions to prevent myopia from worsening. Myopia typically begins in school aged children and can worsen until the leveling out usually in your mid twenties. As far as the visual component is concerned, usually, a pair of glasses or contact lenses are sufficient. Once the eyes have stopped growing, refractive surgery procedures can be employed as well. But keep in mind that simply correcting your vision will not stop your eyes from getting worse. The root cause of myopia, an eyeball that continues to grow excessively long during our youth, needs to be addressed. Special pharmaceutical agents such as atropine have been shown to slow down the progression of myopia considerably. Special contacts such as orthokeratology lenses worn at night are effective as well. Even soft contact lenses and glasses designed with special optics different from the traditional pair of glasses can be effective to slow down the rate of myopic progression. Custom Orthokeratology or Overnight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed contact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while sleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names for orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping system, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the curvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While initially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see more clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in reducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused in front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the optical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact lenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning and disinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper hygiene ‘ortho k’ is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating children of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that can be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to treat children with amblyopia, sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic progression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are being designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight contact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia by almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers throughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral retina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact lens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia as well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating Eyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a similar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is a particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact lenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s bodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of power in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial length elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids just like yours so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above are four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been diagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with a contact lens while sleeping.

January 1, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Routine visits to the eye doctor are necessary for maintaining the good health of your eyes. If you feel that there is something wrong with your vision or experiencing discomfort in your eyes, you must consult a specialist immediately. You can either go to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist if you have issues with your eyes. Read on to discover which eye exam doctor you should visit for your eye condition. Optometrists VS Ophthalmologists An optometrist attends optometry school for four years and usually do a year of residency. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist goes to medical school for four years and does a four year residency. Also, an ophthalmologist typically does a fellowship for one to two years. They can choose a specialty like glaucoma or pediatrics. Ophthalmologists will have an MD or DO following their name while optometrists will have an OD after their names. Who Should You Go To? Both optometrists and ophthalmologists can prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses. The main difference between the two professions is that an ophthalmologist performs surgeries while optometrists don’t. Ophthalmologists are surgeons who can also treat eye diseases. States may indicate which conditions optometrists can treat while ophthalmologists can treat all eye diseases. For eye exams and prescriptions, you can go to both eye doctors. Usually, an optometrist is the better option for those who need more contacts. On the other hand, those who need surgeries should consult an ophthalmologist. It’s the same for serious conditions like macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. For your eye care needs, you can depend on Lumen Optometric.

Both organizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia, and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life. What is Myopia? Myopia causes blurry distance vision, which can be compensated for with glasses or contact lenses to provide a child with clear vision. However, myopia is caused by an eye that is growing too long and, once started, myopia usually gets worse in children as the eye continues to grow abnormally fast. Higher myopia increases the lifetime risk of serious eye diseases such as retinal diseases and glaucoma. How Bad is the Myopia epidemic? In late 2019, the American Academy of Ophthalmology created a Task Force on Myopia, recognizing the importance of this growing disease in children and the potential lifelong impact myopia has on individuals and society. This task force identified priorities of educating other physicians, working with government agencies and health agencies, and educating parents and schools about this issue so that more proactive steps can be taken to help children. Treehouse Eyes Co founder, Matt Oerding, was recently interviewed about the prevalence of myopia alongside Dr. William Reynolds of the American Optometric Association and Dr. Emily McCourt, the chief of ophthalmology at Children’s Hospital Colorado.” Over the last two decades, there’s been an increase in myopia or nearsightedness worldwide, not just in the United States. And that corresponds with an increase in near devices, especially digital devices,” Reynolds said. Watch the full interview by clicking here. Myopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050. Can Myopia be Stopped? There is hope for parents, however, as several treatments are now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good candidate for treatment.

It’s estimated that the 700,000 workplace eye injuries that happen every year cost businesses roughly $934 million in combined productivity loss, health costs, fines, and employee compensation. That’s why employers are being encouraged to promote vision health among their employees this Workplace Eye Wellness Month. Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, shares eye care tips below: Remind Employees to Observe the 20 20 20 Rule While using a computer, you should take short breaks to allow your eye muscles to rest. Every 20 minutes, employees should look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Avoid Sitting Too Close to the Computer Screen A common myth is that you can develop myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) if you sit too close to the screen. However, this myth has been debunked by the fact the two vision conditions have strong genetic links. While sitting close to the screen won’t cause nearsightedness or farsightedness, it can increase digital eye strain. To prevent digital eye strain, the computer screen should be about 20 to 28 inches away from the face. However, if employees keep moving closer to the screen to see better, they should see an eye specialist as soon as possible. That’s because they may need a higher prescription for their eyeglasses or contact lenses. Adjust the Computer’s Display Settings Another way to reduce digital eye strain is to adjust the computer’s display settings to make it easier for your eyes to follow the text and see images. Adjust the computer display’s brightness to the same level as your workplace’s brightness, enlarge the font size for easier viewing, and reduce the color temperature to reduce the blue light the short wavelength visible light associated with increased eye strain emitted. Alternatively, employees can also wear computer glasses, which have yellow tinted lenses that block blue light. For more tips on reducing your exposure to blue light, consult your local eye doctor.

Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, with the symptom being blurry distance vision. Studies show that myopia rates in children are increasing as kids spend less time outdoors and more time involved in near work like digital device use. What many parents don’t know is that rapidly progressing myopia is more than just a hassle it can harm your child’s eye health. Children with progressive myopia are far more likely to develop potentially sight threatening eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration later in life. Given the growing prevalence of myopia in children the media are taking notice. There have been a number of articles recently about this issue in the New York Times, Women Fitness and more locally here in Bay Area Moms and Macaroni Kid. These articles have great tips for parents. We recommended kids get outside at least 2 3 hours a day and take frequent breaks from screen use to help their vision. We also offer new myopia treatments, including customized contact lenses and prescription eye drops, that we can use to treat myopia. Our practice specializes in providing these treatments and offers myopia consultations to customize a treatment plan for each child. What Causes Myopia to Progress? Genetics play a large role in myopia development. Two nearsighted parents are more likely to have a myopic child than a couple with only one myopic parent, or no myopic parents at all. No one knows exactly why myopia progresses, but spending most of the day indoors, focusing on near objects like screens and books, may be risk factors. More research is needed to determine whether the fact that children are spending less time looking at faraway objects like a moving baseball or a basketball net might be contributing to the increase in myopia cases around the world. How Can I Prevent Myopia From Worsening? One of the best pieces of advice for parents of nearsighted children is to increase their child’s outdoor playtime in the sun. In research studies, the progression of myopia was slower in children who spent a considerable amount of time in the sunshine than in children who did not. The World Health Organization advises that children under 5 spend 1 hour or less per day in front of a screen, and no screen time is recommended for infants under 1. The Children’s Eye Foundation recommends outdoor play daily, and no screen time for children under 2. They also recommend no more than 1 2 hours per day for 2 to 5 year olds, with frequent breaks. How Can a Eye Doctor Help? Myopia management eye doctors do more than prescribe corrective lenses. Although no actual cure for myopia exists, there are methods that can help control its progression. Like most treatments, myopia treatment in children is most effective when started early before a child is highly myopic.

When it comes to their vision, early detection of issues like nearsightedness (myopia) is crucial for timely intervention and effective management. Myopia can impact a child’s academic performance, social interactions, and overall quality of life if left unaddressed. In this article, we’ll highlight key signs that parents should watch for to identify if their child may be experiencing nearsightedness. Frequent Squinting: One of the most common signs of nearsightedness in children is squinting. If you notice your child squinting often, especially when trying to see distant objects like road signs or the whiteboard at school, it could indicate that they are having difficulty focusing on distant objects. Sitting Close to the TV or Holding Devices Close: Children with nearsightedness may instinctively sit closer to the television or hold digital devices closer to their face to see more clearly. While occasional closeness to screens is common, persistent behavior of this nature could be a red flag for myopia. Complaints of Headaches or Eye Strain: Children experiencing nearsightedness may complain of frequent headaches or eye strain, particularly after engaging in activities that require focusing on distant objects for extended periods, such as reading or watching movies in a theater. Difficulty Seeing the Whiteboard or Screen at School: If your child consistently has difficulty seeing the whiteboard or screen in the classroom, despite sitting in the front rows, it could indicate nearsightedness. They may also struggle to recognize faces or objects from a distance. Rubbing Eyes Frequently: Excessive rubbing of the eyes can be a sign of eye fatigue or strain, which often accompanies nearsightedness. If you observe your child rubbing their eyes frequently, especially after engaging in activities that require visual concentration, it’s worth investigating further. Decline in Academic Performance: Unexplained declines in academic performance, particularly in subjects that require visual acuity like reading or math, may be attributed to undiagnosed nearsightedness. If your child’s grades suddenly drop or they express frustration with schoolwork, consider scheduling an eye exam. Family History of Myopia: Genetics play a significant role in the development of myopia. If one or both parents have myopia, there’s an increased likelihood that their children will also develop the condition. Keep this in mind and remain vigilant for signs of nearsightedness in your child, especially if there’s a family history. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia: Recognizing the signs of nearsightedness in your child early on is essential for proactive intervention and effective management. If you observe any of the aforementioned signs or have concerns about your child’s vision, don’t hesitate to schedule an myopia consultation with a Treehouse Eyes provider. Remember, addressing vision issues promptly can significantly impact your child’s overall well being and success in various aspects of life. Let’s work together to ensure our children’s vision remains clear for a bright future ahead.

It can help you sleep better by regulating your circadian rhythm. Studies show that daily and healthy exposure to sunlight can benefit the eyes of little ones. A local scleral optometrist explains why safe sun exposure is great for your children’s eyes. Sunlight and Your Kids’ Eyes Myopia or nearsightedness happens when the shape of the eye is too curved, keeping light from properly focusing on the retina. People who have it struggle to see distant objects. When not detected and treated early, it can affect a child’s performance in school and at play. Have you noticed that your child blinks or squints a lot? Do they often complain of headaches or that they can’t see the words on the board at school? If so, it’s best to schedule a visit with your local optometrist. These are typical signs of nearsightedness in children. At Lumen Optometric, we are here for your family’s vision correction and dry eye treatment needs. Moreover, research shows that children who spend time outdoors are less likely to develop this vision condition. Experts believe bright sunlight can aid in the retina’s production of dopamine, a hormone that can help regulate eye growth. Tips for Healthy Sun Exposure While natural light might benefit your child’s eyes, you should discourage them from looking directly at the sun. Like adults, they need to wear UV blocking sunglasses to keep their eyes safe from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. Even when it’s cloudy outside, you and your child should apply sunscreen and wear sunglasses. Wearing a wide brimmed hat can also reduce the UV rays that reach your little one’s eyes. Then, limit their time outdoors during the sun’s peak hours, which is from midday to early afternoon. Routine eye exams can help you keep track of your family’s vision and eye health.

It affects the cornea, or the clear layer that covers your eye’s iris and protects the pupil. Lumen Optometric discusses its causes, symptoms, and treatment. What Causes a Scratched Cornea? Anything that comes into contact with the clear surface of your eyes can lead to a corneal abrasion. Rubbing your eyes too hard can cause a scratched cornea, as well as a grain of dust or sand getting lodged on the front of your eye. Wearing contact lenses longer than is recommended and poking your eye accidentally can also lead to this type of eye injury. The risk of a scratched cornea increases when you experience dry eye syndrome. Being diagnosed with this condition makes it hard for you to sleep, since the eyelids may stick to the cornea. Upon waking up, your eyelids may tear a part of your cornea, resulting in a scratch or abrasion. What Are the Symptoms of a Scratched Cornea? Any eye injury, including a corneal abrasion, must be examined by your eye doctor.

They might experience difficulty seeing in dimly lit areas. As you age, your risk of developing certain eye conditions also increases. These are among the many reasons seniors should see their eye doctor regularly. Learn more about the importance of senior eye care from a local scleral optometrist. Why Is Senior Eye Care Important? Individuals over 60 are more prone to eye diseases that can lead to irreversible vision changes. Many of these conditions do not manifest symptoms until they are in their later stages. Some of the most usual age related eye problems include cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Dry eye and retinal detachment are also common in seniors. Moreover, their early detection and treatment are crucial to preserve vision and improve quality of life. Quick Eye Care Tips for Seniors Schedule Routine Eye Exams Regardless of age, you must see your eye doctor regularly. Routine comprehensive eye exams can detect eye problems in their initial stages. Early treatment of vision threatening conditions is essential to preserving vision. Also, only an eye care specialist can trace changes in your vision. They can determine if you need dry eye treatment or new prescription eyewear. Make Indoor Spaces More Accessible Good lighting can enhance the safety of your living space. Place nightlights in hallways, bedrooms and hallways to reduce the likelihood of falling or tripping. To make rooms easier to navigate, consider having furnishings, walls and flooring in contrasting colors. For instance, light colored countertops make dark colored items easier to see. Eat Nourishing Meals Leafy greens, nuts, oily fish and citrus fruits are beneficial to eye health. Eat foods rich in zinc, omega 3 fatty acids, carotenoids, and vitamins A, C, and E. Meanwhile, minimize your consumption of foods high in saturated fats, sodium and sugar. Exercise Regularly Daily movement can improve blood circulation in your eyes. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight, lowering your risk of diabetes. Walking, stretching and yoga are gentler exercises seniors can try.

Blog eye care Should You Go for Daily or Monthly Contact Lenses?Should You Go for Daily or Monthly Contact Lenses? October 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Cutting corners is never an option when it comes to proper eye care. As such, you’ll want to know which type of contact lenses best suit your needs and preferences, so it does its job while not getting in the way of your daily routine. However, with so many specific choices available, it can be a bit overwhelming to work out which type of lenses are best for your use. To help you determine your most preferred type of contact lenses, corneal reshaping expert Lumen Optometric has put together a quick comparison between daily and monthly contact lenses, and which is most ideal for your daily use. Daily Contact Lenses Also known as daily disposables, they come ready to insert in individual blister packs for one day use. When the day’s done and you’re about to sleep in for the night, just dispose of your lenses in the trash. When you wake up, you open another blister pack for a new pair. You don’t need to worry about cleaning or storing the lenses each time you use daily contact lenses since they’re disposable. They’re also generally very thin and have a high water content, and if you remove these contacts during the day for any reason, you’ll need to replace them with a fresh new pair. Monthly Contact Lenses These lenses are thicker and more durable than daily lenses because they have to resist drying out while you store and use them for 30 days. When you aren’t wearing them, you can store the contact lenses in a small two sided container with some contact solution. When using monthly contact lenses, you need to clean them to avoid infections and protein buildup. There are various contact solutions you can use to clean monthly lenses, and you should only use the ones recommended by your eye doctor. This is because different brands and types of solutions that use different chemicals can be incompatible and even destroy a contact they’re not designed for. Which is More Ideal for Your Use? The type of contact lenses you’ll use can actually depend on what your trusted eye doctor prescribes you. Your prescription might determine whether you choose monthly or daily contact lenses, but not all types of contacts are available for every prescription. For instance, if you need multifocal lenses, some are only available as monthlies. But if your prescription allows you to use both daily and monthly lenses, then you can consider which is better for your lifestyle. If your lifestyle makes it likely that something may get in your eye, then having daily disposables means you can just take out the lens and throw it out so you won’t have to bother with trying to clean the contact of any contaminants. This is especially handy if you work outdoors or don’t have easy access to facilities to clean and store your contact lenses. But if you have a controlled lifestyle and always have access to a washroom and mirror to remove and clean your lenses if needed, then monthlies could work better for your daily use.

Overexposure to the sun, particularly its UV rays, can damage your eyes too. This eye condition is called photokeratitis or ultraviolet keratitis. Your trusted eye exam doctor at Lumen Optometric lists the symptoms of photokeratitis and what you can do to treat your sunburned eyes. Symptoms of Sunburned Eyes It can be hard to tell when your eyes are already being overexposed to the sun. But if your eyes hurt whenever you look at an area near the sun, it’s usually an indication that your eyes have been overexposed to UV rays. Apart from this, you may also experience the following symptoms: eye painlight sensitivityblurry visionredness or discomfort in the eyesseeing haloseyelid twitchingheadachegritty feeling in the eyestemporary loss of vision These symptoms can last for one or two days.

How to Treat Sunburned Eyes Photokeratitis usually resolves on its own within a couple of days, so its treatment is mainly focused on reducing discomfort from the symptoms. During this time, make sure to rest your eyes and remove your contact lenses. This will help your eyes heal more quickly. You can also ask your doctor if they will recommend pain relievers or antibiotic eye drops. Below are some other at home remedies that you can try: Close your eyes and place cool compress over them.Don’t rub your eyes as this will only cause further irritation.Lubricate your eyes with artificial tears.

AMD typically occurs as aging causes damage to the macula, a part of the retina that controls sharp vision. While it does not cause total blindness, AMD makes it harder for people to perform their daily routines, such as reading, driving, or doing any close up work. In this article, Lumen Optometric, known for high quality eyeglasses and contact lenses, explains everything you need to know about AMD. What Are the Different Types and Symptoms of AMD? There are two types of AMD: dry and wet. Dry AMD, also called atrophic AMD, occurs when the macula gets thinner and progresses slowly over many years. It also has three stages: early, intermediate, and late. During the early and intermediate dry AMD stage, some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience mild blurriness in their central vision. On the other hand, wet AMD, also called advanced neovascular AMD, is a less common type of late AMD. It happens when abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, which eventually causes damage to the macula. As such, wet AMD causes faster vision loss. It’s important to note that any stage of dry AMD can turn into wet AMD, but wet AMD is always late. People with late AMD may notice straight lines looking wavy or crooked. They may also see a blurry area near the center of their vision, which may get bigger as time goes by. Some people report seeing blank spots or having trouble seeing in low lighting. If you experience any of these symptoms, be sure to see an optometrist immediately. How Do Doctors Diagnose AMD? One effective way to check if you have AMD is through an eye exam. Your eye exam doctor may also perform any of the following procedures to diagnose AMD successfully: Distance and near vision acuity testsDilated eye examination (which also includes using an ophthalmoscope) The pupil of your eye is dilated to allow your doctor to observe your macula at the inside back wall of the eye.Optical coherence tomography testing (OCT) To gain a clearer picture of your macula and its supporting layers, OCT generates high quality images of the eye.

It affects all of the systems of the body, including the eyes. The decrease in estrogen levels can alter one’s eyesight. Even the shape of the eyes undergoes a slight change, making it hard for women to wear contact lenses comfortably. Eye Conditions Associated With Menopause The following are some of the most common eye conditions that affect women during menopause: Dry Eyes – Women over the age of 50 have been shown to be at high risk of developing symptoms of dry eye syndrome such as blurred vision, light sensitivity and swollen or reddened eyelids. The decrease in hormone levels can also lower the salinity of the inner tear film and the oils of the outer tear film. Cataracts – Decreased hormone levels can also increase the risk for cataracts. Common signs and symptoms include seeing fading colors and halos around light sources and having difficulty seeing at night. Scheduling regular visits to your eye exam doctor can help detect this condition early. Glaucoma – This eye condition is also common in menopausal women. It leads to the damage of the optic nerve, usually from increased eye pressure. Early detection and treatment can help protect the eyes from vision loss associated with glaucoma. Eye Care During Menopause Taking a proactive approach is the best way to preserve your vision during your menopause years. In addition to annual eye exams, your eye doctor may recommend hormone therapy to restore your estrogen levels. While it may help reduce the risk of developing these eye conditions, patients who undergo such are four to seven times more likely to develop dry eye symptoms. Other ways to control menopause symptoms include a more natural approach like taking herbal supplements and consuming a diet rich in Vitamin D. Lifestyle changes can also help reduce dry eye symptoms like removing drafts and wearing wraparound sunglasses outdoors.

We will be discussing the four best ways to treat your myopia so it no longer gets worse. Everything we discuss is based on solid science and research, double masked clinical trials, and recommendations based on mountains of peer reviewed data. Certainly, we’ve heard and researched other more holistic approaches, if they turn out to be effective, know that this is surely a growing field however and as things change you’ll certainly hear it from us first! What is Myopia? Before you can defeat your enemy, you need to know exactly what it is. Myopia is a disease of the eye that is usually the result of an eyeball that has grown too long. We call how long the eyeball is the ‘axial length’. When the axial length grows excessively long, your vision will suffer in direct correlation. So any treatment we discuss has to show efficacy in its ability to reduce axial length elongation compared to a control group. Other times, the cornea may be too steep which can also cause myopia. However, for the sake of this article, we will address the major cause of myopia which is the excessive axial length of the eye. As when we talk about managing myopia, we will be talking about ways that have shown clinical evidence in slowing down axial length growth. Custom Orthokeratology or Overnight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed contact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while sleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names for orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping system, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the curvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While initially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see more clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in reducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused in front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the optical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact lenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning, and disinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper hygiene this is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating children of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that can be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to treat children with amblyopia, or sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic progression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are being designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight contact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia by almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers throughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral retina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact lens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia as well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating Eyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a similar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is a particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact lenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s bodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of power in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial length elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids just like yours so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above are four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been diagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with a contact lens while sleeping. Atropine involves an eye drop that can signal the eye to grow a little slower. Custom soft multifocal lenses are worn during the day. And even specially designed glasses are on the horizon to improve the progression of myopia.

But with so many of these conditions identified by the medical community, it can be hard to list down all of their possible effects on the eyes. Understanding the risk your specific autoimmune disorder poses to your vision is key to ensuring optimal eye health. Consult your eye doctor immediately if you start experiencing eyesight problems. In this blog, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye care center for neurolens® treatment, shares some of the autoimmune disorders that affect the eyes. Lupus It is a type of autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body, including the eyes. It can lead to eye related conditions like retinal vascular lesions and optic neuropathy. Symptoms may include blurred vision, sore or dry eyes, and light sensitivity. Rheumatoid Arthritis It is a chronic multisystem disease with musculoskeletal manifestations. While it primarily targets the hands, arms, legs and feet, this inflammatory disorder can also affect the eyes. Dry eye syndrome, however, is the most common eye condition to accompany rheumatoid arthritis. A visit to an eye doctor can help determine necessary dry eye treatment to alleviate discomfort. Other eye related conditions associated with rheumatoid arthritis include scleritis (inflammation of the white part of the eye) and uveitis (inflammation of the tissues in the eyewall). Multiple Sclerosis This autoimmune disorder affects the central nervous system. Given that the optic nerve is directly connected to it, an individual may be diagnosed with MS after the development of initial symptoms of vision problems. Optic neuritis, for instance, can bring a combination of color vision loss, blurred vision and double vision that usually affects only one eye.

Seeking a comprehensive eye examination after a concussion is crucial for several reasons, including the detection and management of vision problems that may arise as a result of the head injury. Continue reading as a trusted eye exam doctor further discusses the importance of having your eyes checked post concussion. Visual Disturbances and Concussions Concussions can lead to a range of visual disturbances, such as blurred vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia) and difficulty focusing. These symptoms may not be immediately apparent but can manifest in the days or weeks following the injury. A post concussion eye exam helps identify and address these issues, promoting a more effective recovery. Detecting Ocular Motor Dysfunction Concussions often affect the coordination of eye movements, known as ocular motor function. This can result in difficulties with tracking objects, maintaining focus or experiencing eye strain. A specialized eye examination can pinpoint ocular motor dysfunction, guiding the implementation of targeted therapies to improve eye coordination and alleviate associated symptoms. Assessing Binocular Vision Problems Binocular vision problems, where the eyes struggle to work together seamlessly, are common after concussions. This can lead to double vision, depth perception challenges and discomfort. Through a comprehensive check, an eye doctor can assess binocular vision problems and recommend appropriate interventions, such as vision therapy or corrective lenses. Addressing Light Sensitivity Photophobia is a frequent symptom post concussion. Exposure to light can exacerbate headaches and discomfort, whether you’re wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses. Optometrists can evaluate the extent of light sensitivity during an eye exam and recommend strategies to manage it effectively. This may include specialized lenses or advice on controlling lighting environments. Preventing Prolonged Visual Symptoms Early detection and intervention are key to preventing prolonged visual symptoms after a concussion. Without proper assessment and treatment, visual issues may persist and impact daily life. Timely eye exams can identify underlying problems and enable the implementation of targeted therapies, promoting a smoother recovery process. Lumen Optometric is a trusted eye specialist in the area.

Vision problems may inevitably lead to challenges in reading, writing and even social activities. The Eye as a Health Indicator Beyond vision, an eye exam can be a window to your child’s overall health. Vision problems can hint at other health issues, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. In some cases, an eye exam can be the first step in diagnosing such conditions. The Benefits of Early Detection As with most health problems, catching eye issues early makes a big difference. For instance, certain corrective measures work best when started early. Identifying eye concerns early helps avoid potential complications and ensures your child’s vision is not adversely impacted. Why a Yearly Exam Is Necessary Regular eye exams are vital in monitoring vision changes and intervening promptly when necessary. While basic screenings in school can help flag significant problems, they don’t compare to a comprehensive exam by a professional optometrist. They go beyond reading charts to examine the eye’s health and ensure anomalies are treated before they become more serious. Schedule Your Child’s Eye Exam at Lumen Optometric Annual eye exams for kids offer a way to safeguard their academic success, ensure their eyes are developing as they should, and even act as a preventive health measure.

(While staring at a computer screen, you tend to blink less often. This increases the risk of dry eye because blinking is how a tear film which helps keep your eyes moist is spread across the surface of your eye.) However, recent studies have shown that having diabetes mellitus increases your risk for dry eyes. Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, explains how diabetes and dry eyes are connected and elaborate on the possible treatment options below: How Diabetes and Dry Eyes Are Connected Some medical researchers believe diabetic neuropathy can explain the connection between diabetes and dry eyes. Neuropathy happens when some of the nerves are damaged. It’s also a risk factor for lacrimal gland dysfunction. If the lacrimal gland (which secretes the watery component of the tear film) is damaged, tear production decreases. This, in turn, increases a patient’s risk for dry eyes. Important: Diabetes is just one of several factors that can increase your risk for dry eyes. Other factors include age (it’s not uncommon for people aged over 65 to experience dry eyes) and environmental conditions (tears evaporate more quickly in dry climates). If you have any of the aforementioned risk factors, you should undergo an eye exam at least once a year. Through routine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect and treat eye conditions before they progress or give higher prescriptions for contact lenses before blurry vision interferes with your daily routines. How Are Dry Eyes Treated Your eye doctor may recommend the following treatment options: Artificial tears – To alleviate the symptoms of mild or moderate dry eyes, you may need to apply artificial tears several times during the day. Eye inserts – An eye insert resembles a grain of rice and releases lubrication as it dissolves. It is placed between your lower eyelid and your eyeball. To learn more about your treatment options, consult your local eye doctor. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including corneal reshaping services.

Since their early invention, contact lenses have progressed a long way, transitioning from glass to hard plastic and finally to the soft materials we use today. In this blog post, we’ll delve into how exactly contact lenses are made and how manufacturers have revolutionized the way they are produced by harnessing modern technology and materials. The Foundation: Materials and Molding The journey begins with selecting the base material. Soft contact lenses are typically made from hydrogel or silicone hydrogel, which are chosen for their oxygen permeability and biocompatibility. These materials allow your eyes to breathe, which is essential for healthy wear. Rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, on the other hand, prioritize oxygen permeability even further. They are primarily made from highly durable and breathable plastics like fluoropolymers combined with silicone. Once the material is chosen, the lenses undergo a molding process to achieve their final shape. Here’s where the methods differ. Soft Contact Lenses Soft contact lenses are made through spin casting or lathe cutting process. Spin casting involves depositing liquid plastic into molds and then spinning them until the plastic takes the desired shape. Lathe cutting, meanwhile, involves carving the plastic into lens form. Computer controlled tools meticulously sculpt the lens from a disc of material. Both methods lead to polishing for comfort and hydration before reaching your eyes. Rigid Gas Permeable Lenses RGP lenses prioritize oxygen permeability, which is crucial for healthy corneal function. Their shaping process utilizes lathe cutting, which offers greater precision for intricate designs. It meticulously sculpts the lens design from the disc, similar to a woodworking lathe but with incredible accuracy. This allows for intricate shapes and sharper edges. RGP lenses can have complex curves and features to address specific vision needs, like astigmatism. Lathe cutting enables these intricate geometries. Additionally, precise cutting ensures clean and sharp edges on the lens, which is necessary for optimal tear flow and lens stability in the eye. Shaping and Finishing Touches Following the molding stage, both soft and RGP lenses undergo additional processes to ensure comfort and clarity. Polishing: Lenses are polished to achieve a smooth and comfortable surface for wearers. This step is essential for both soft and RGP lenses to minimize irritation. Hydration (Soft Lenses Only): Soft contact lenses are bathed in a sterile solution to absorb water and achieve their characteristic flexibility. This step is not required for RGP lenses. Quality Control and Packaging Every lens, soft or RGP, undergoes rigorous inspection for any defects or imperfections. This enables your scleral optometrist to provide you with only the highest quality lenses. Finally, the lenses are packaged in sterile blisters filled with saline solution. This solution keeps soft lenses hydrated and all lenses ready for use. Advanced Types of Contact Lenses Today, advancements in eye care have led to the development of customized contact lenses for specific eye conditions. For example, specially crafted lenses can now be made for irregularly shaped corneas. Additionally, advancements in materials have led to extended wear options for both soft and RGP lenses, allowing comfortable wear for extended periods. If you are undergoing dry eye treatment, be sure to work closely with your eye doctor to find the best solution for your vision needs. Get Your Lenses From Lumen Optometric Today The manufacturing process of contact lenses is a complex and precise dance of science and technology, catering to the specific needs of soft and RGP lenses. The next time you pop in your lenses, take a moment to appreciate the incredible journey they’ve taken to help you see the world clearly and comfortably.

These lenses offer a smooth transition between distances, eliminating the need for multiple glasses. They can also help treat other eye conditions. However, progressive lenses have pros and cons like any vision correction option. In this article, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of progressive lenses to help you decide whether they are the right choice for you. Pros of Progressive Lenses Here are some of the benefits of progressive lenses. Improved Vision Progressive lenses provide a more seamless transition between different prescriptions, allowing for clearer vision at all distances. Wearers can see objects at varying lengths without switching glasses or straining their eyes. Greater Comfort Progressive lenses eliminate the visible lines that come with traditional bifocals or trifocals. This makes them a more comfortable option for extended wear, particularly for activities like driving or using a computer. More Natural Vision Progressive lenses provide a more natural visual experience than traditional bifocals or reading glasses. This is because they offer a gradual change in prescription, mimicking how the eyes naturally adjust to different distances. Improved Aesthetics With no visible line, progressive lenses provide a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. This appeals to those who want to avoid the stigma of traditional bifocals or reading glasses. Cons of Progressive Lenses Despite their many advantages, there are drawbacks to progressive lenses. These include the following: Cost Progressive lenses can be more expensive than traditional bifocals or reading glasses because they require more advanced technology. This can be a barrier for those on a budget or without insurance coverage for vision correction. Adaptation Period Adjusting to progressive lenses can take some time. This can cause some initial discomfort or disorientation. Reduced Peripheral Vision Since progressive lenses have a narrow corridor of clear vision, wearers may experience reduced peripheral vision. This can be a safety concern, especially when driving or navigating unfamiliar environments. Increased Risk of Glare Progressive lenses can create more reflections and glare, particularly in bright light conditions. This can be an issue for those outdoors or in environments with bright lighting. How to Adapt to Progressive Lenses When adapting to progressive lenses, allow a few days for your eyes to get used to your new lens prescription. Practice focusing on familiar objects that are located at different distances from you so you can easily switch between far and near vision when needed. Patience also goes a long way in getting used to progressive lenses. To be sure that progressive lenses are right for you, schedule a consultation at Lumen Optometric.

As a parent, you also want to make sure that your child can see well enough to do the things they enjoy doing. Pediatric optometrists are specialized healthcare professionals who care for the visual and ocular needs of infants, children, and teens. In this article, we will discuss some factors you must consider when choosing an optometrist for your children. Location Location is essential when choosing the best optometrist for kids near you. If your child has a busy schedule, it may be more difficult for them to travel long distances to get to their appointments. Maybe you’re unsure about how far away from home an office is. Ask the doctor or staff if they have any recommendations on other practices they could recommend that might better suit your needs. Call ahead if multiple offices are within driving distance of your home. Make sure each office offers the same services before making an appointment with them. Experience The experience of an optometrist for children is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing the best eye doctor for kids. An excellent way to gauge this is by asking how long they’ve been practicing optometry and whether they have additional training relevant to your child’s specific needs (such as myopia management). Treehouse Eyes provides expert pediatric myopia care and ensures this with accessibility to Treehouse AMP, a video based parent education platform. Treehouse Eyes doctors are always willing to answer any questions regarding myopia and while also cultivating a kid friendly office experience. Recommendations The best way to find a pediatric optometrist you can rely on and who will get along well with your child is through referrals and recommendations. If you know someone who had a positive experience with an eye doctor, find out who they used and why they thought so highly of them. Consider that some of your friends have young children of their own. Before choosing which practice is best for you and your family, it might be useful to know what kind of experiences other people have had there. If no one in your family or circle of friends can personally recommend an optometrist, look online for reviews of nearby practices. You can also use the Google Maps business filter by typing “optometrist for children near me” into the search bar. You can add whatever city or town you live in and see the reviews. This should bring up several options nearby where children receive treatment from professionals specializing in vision care issues explicitly related to young people (such as myopia). Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor. Schedule a consultation now to find out more.

The right glasses are comfortable and give you sharp vision throughout the day. Despite the dependability of this eyewear, it can still cause spots or pimples to form on your face. Fortunately, there are several ways to avoid this issue. Here’s what you can do to prevent breakouts from wearing eyeglasses. Clean Your Glasses Frequently The pressure that eyeglasses put on your skin is what usually causes acne. It prevents dead skin cells from shedding, causing them to clog your pores and form pimples. If you have oily skin or wear thick layers of makeup, you are more likely to get breakouts from eyeglass wear. Regularly cleaning your eyeglasses will help prevent breakouts. You can use an alcohol wipe to clean them, focusing on areas that touch your skin. Have Your Glasses Adjusted Does it feel like your glasses are so heavy or pushing too hard on your nose? Excessive pressure from your glasses can contribute to breakouts. If this is the case, see your eye doctor and have your eyeglass frame adjusted. In some cases, replacing the nose bridges allow more even pressure distribution. Give Your Face a Break from Eyeglasses When you wear eyeglasses every day, it’s easy to forget that you even have them on. While they give you sharper vision, it helps to take breaks from wearing them from time to time. It relieves the pressure on your face that often contributes to breakouts. Remove Your Makeup at the End of the Day Thoroughly remove your makeup at the end of the day. Cosmetic products can accumulate under your glasses, increasing the likelihood of acne. Using makeup remover before cleansing ensures that you’re really getting rid of the products on your face. Don’t wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor.

Without proper treatment, vision problems can affect a child’s learning, increase the risk of permanent vision loss and even lead to behavioral issues. The American Optometric Association strongly recommends your little one see an eye exam doctor yearly. This Healthy Vision Month, we are sharing tips on taking a proactive approach to your child’s eye health. Avoid Excess Screen Time At least two screen time increases the risk of obesity, mood swings, aggressive behavior and obesity in children. The blue light from digital devices can contribute to digital eye strain. This eye condition is usually characterized by blurred vision, dry eye, headaches, and neck and shoulder pain. According to the Department of Health, children below two should have no screen time because it can affect physical and language development. Schedule Regular Eye Exams It’s a common misconception that you only need to see an eye care specialist if you need to update your contact lenses or eyeglasses. Regular eye exams can detect and treat eye conditions early in adults and children. If you see your child constantly squinting, tilting their head, or rubbing their eyes, schedule an appointment with your eye doctor immediately. These are common signs of vision problems in young individuals. Prepare Well Balanced Meals Incorporating leafy greens and foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids in your daily meals is beneficial to the entire family’s eye health. Vitamin A in leafy greens can lower the risk of dry eye syndrome, while omega 3 fatty acids can lower the risk of cataracts and age related macular degeneration. It’s also a good idea to consume fruits rich in vitamins C and E, such as pineapples, oranges, strawberries and mangoes. These vitamins can help restore tissues in your eyes and prevent infections. Moreover, an overall balanced diet is essential in preventing obesity and hypertension, which contribute to several eye diseases.

Protecting your eyes from the sun’s damage is crucial to maintaining good eye health and preventing problems down the road. This blog post discusses the risks of UV exposure and provides you with practical tips for keeping your eyes safe from the sun’s harmful effects. Understand the Risks of UV Exposure UV exposure can have both short term and long term effects on your eyes. In the short term, you may experience photokeratitis, also known as “sunburn of the eye,” or pterygium, a growth on the white of the eye. Long term damage includes cataracts and macular degeneration. Some individuals are at higher risk for UV related eye problems, such as outdoor workers and those with light colored eyes. Choose the Right Sunglasses The right pair of sunglasses can play a significant role in protecting your eyes from UV damage. Look for sunglasses labeled with 100% UVA and UVB protection. Lens color and tint can also make a difference. Gray, green and brown lenses can help maintain color recognition. Consider polarized lenses to reduce glare, especially if you spend a lot of time near water or snow. Wraparound frames offer added protection by shielding your eyes from sunlight entering from the sides. Wear a Wide Brimmed Hat A wide brimmed hat can provide additional protection from indirect sunlight. By reducing your exposure to harmful UV rays, you can lower the risk of eye damage. Schedule Regular Eye Exams Early detection and prevention are essential to maintaining good eye health. Regular visits to an eye exam doctor can help you monitor changes in your vision and eye health. Comprehensive exams can catch problems early, giving you the best chance for successful treatment. Consider Protective Contact Lenses For contact lens wearers, UV blocking contact lenses can offer an added layer of protection against the sun’s harmful rays. Consult an optometrist to determine which type of contact lenses are best suited for you. Explore Orthokeratology Orthokeratology or ortho k, is a treatment that involves wearing specially designed contact lenses overnight to reshape the cornea. This non surgical procedure can help reduce the risk of UV damage to the eye and improve vision. Take Precautions During Peak Sun Hours Avoiding direct sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. can help protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. If you must be outdoors during these hours, seek shade whenever possible. Educate Children on Eye Protection Teaching children about the importance of eye protection from a young age is crucial for maintaining their long term eye health. Encourage kids to wear sunglasses and hats when outdoors to shield their eyes from the sun. Protecting your eyes from UV damage is essential for maintaining good eye health. By understanding the risks and taking the necessary precautions, you can reduce your chances of developing UV related eye problems.

Around 30% of teenagers, 9% of kids in school, and 5% of preschoolers have it. If both of a child’s parents are nearsighted, the child is more likely to have myopia. Myopia is generally on the rise, particularly in children. Experts believe that it might have something to do with spending more time indoors playing video games and using electronic gadgets. Read on to learn about some of the best myopia treatment options for children. The Development of Myopia When a child’s eyeball grows too rapidly relative to the usual pace of eye growth, myopia occurs. It may also develop if the cornea, the transparent window in front of the eye, curves too sharply. Light rays are unable to reach the retina when they enter the eye, which makes nearby objects look clear and distant objects look blurry. Treating Myopia in Childhood Although it cannot be cured or reversed, myopia can be managed and treated. The treatment’s objectives are to strengthen your child’s vision and stop it from deteriorating. Managing myopia is crucial for maintaining their eye health. Treatment Options to Combat Myopia Progression: Specialized Contact Lenses: Customized multifocal contact lenses are tailored to address myopia progression by slowing down eye growth in some children. Additionally, orthokeratology, also known as Ortho K, offers a unique solution by reshaping the cornea overnight, thus ensuring clearer vision throughout the day. Low Dose Atropine Eye Drops: Children may benefit from the use of low dose atropine eye drops, similar to those administered during routine eye examinations. This treatment approach has shown promise in managing myopia progression effectively. Increasing Outdoor Time: Encouraging children to spend more time outdoors can help counteract the onset and progression of myopia. Balancing screen time with outdoor activities is vital for safeguarding their eye health as they continue to grow. Consultation with a Treehouse Eyes Provider: For parents unsure about the most suitable treatment option for their child, consulting with a qualified optometrist is essential. Optometrists with myopia management expertise can provide personalized recommendations and guidance tailored to each child’s specific needs and circumstances. In conclusion, addressing myopia in children requires a comprehensive approach focused on effective treatment strategies and proactive management techniques. By leveraging innovative solutions and collaborating with eye care professionals, parents can ensure optimal vision health for their children both now and in the future. If you’re not sure which treatment would be the best choice, consult your optometrist to determine how you can manage your child’s myopia.

This eye condition can cause cloudy or blurred vision and increased light sensitivity. Patients may also experience poor night vision or notice that colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. While cataracts usually occur in older adults, this eye condition can happen to anyone. A local scleral optometrist shares the different types of cataracts. Types of Cataracts Age Related Cataracts Cataracts can occur due to the changes in your eyes as you age. You’re more prone to age related cataracts if you drink alcohol excessively, smoke cigarettes, take steroids and have diabetes. A family history of this eye condition and past eye surgeries also increases your risk for this eye condition. Congenital Cataracts Some people are born with cataracts or develop them in the first year of life. It’s not common for children to have cataracts. If your child’s cataracts are large enough to impact vision, immediate treatment is necessary to avoid further eye problems, like amblyopia or lazy eye. Traumatic Cataracts Blunt and penetrating eye injuries usually cause traumatic cataracts. This form of cataract may develop immediately or years after the eye injury. Secondary Cataracts There is a chance for scar tissue to develop in the eye after cataract surgery. If this happens, your vision will become cloudy again. Secondary cataracts are more common than you think and occur in two out of five people who get cataract surgery. A quick and non invasive procedure called YAG laser capsulotomy is the typical treatment for this type of cataract. Patients usually gain normal vision a few days following treatment. How Are Cataracts Diagnosed? Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial for the early detection of vision threatening conditions like macular degeneration and cataracts. Individuals older than 60 should schedule a dilated eye exam every one to two years. During your appointment, your eye care provider will use dilating eye drops to widen your pupil and check for signs of cataracts and other eye issues. Your doctor might also perform a refraction test, ophthalmoscopy and slit lamp test. These tests will help them determine if you need new prescription glasses or dry eye treatment. How Are Cataracts Treated? If you have cataracts, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. In the initial stages of this eye condition, prescription glasses or contact lenses can help improve vision. You can also use brighter lights in your home and wear anti glare sunglasses outdoors. Moreover, your eye doctor will recommend surgery if cataracts are starting to disrupt your daily tasks. You don’t need to wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor.

In this article, eye care specialists take a look at profiles of patients who may need extra UV eye protection. Construction Workers: Construction workers and other people who work outdoors are exposed to 10 20% more UV light than the average indoor worker. Even if a worker wears a hat outside, the brim can only block their eyes from overhead UV light and not the indirect UV radiation that is reflected on low level surfaces. Outdoor Enthusiasts: Outdoor enthusiasts such as cyclists and hikers spend a lot of time in the sun, thus requiring some protection from UV. Boaters and beachgoers should also equip themselves with eye protection because dry sand can reflect more than 15% of UV light while sea foam can reflect up to 30%. Children: Some kids tend to spend more time outdoors than adults. Long term effects of sun damage are cumulative. The longer children are not protected from the harmful rays of the sun, the more likely they will suffer damage to their eyes in their older years. Contact Lens Wearers: Some patients who wear contact lenses do not bother to wear sunglasses because their contacts block UVA UVB. While there are lenses that protect from UV radiation, they do not cover everything. The skin of the lids and brow bone are left vulnerable and should be covered with a pair of sunglasses. Health Conscious Individuals: If you are conscious about your health, you want to minimize your day to day interaction with environmental hazards. Aside from eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, safeguarding your eyes from UV radiation should be on your priority list, especially if you have a family history of age related macular degeneration.

As such, the process of making prescription lenses involves several steps. Continue reading to learn about prescription lenses, how they are made and the different types available. What Are Prescription Lenses? Prescription lenses are tailored spectacles that correct or improve the wearer’s vision. A dedicated optometrist assesses the unique needs of your eyes and prescribes lenses that adjust how light gets into your eyes, helping you see better. The Process of Making Prescription Lenses Making prescription lenses involves several steps, from the initial eye examination to the final fitting of the lenses into the frames. Here is a general overview of the process. Eye Exam The process begins with an eye examination by an eye doctor. During the exam, they will determine your specific vision prescription, which includes measurements for each eye, such as sphere power (for nearsightedness or farsightedness), cylinder power (for astigmatism) and axis (the orientation of astigmatism correction). If you have presbyopia, your doctor may also determine your reading prescription. Eye exams can also check for eye diseases so your doctor can prescribe the appropriate solution. For those with special eye conditions, you may need to see a specialist, such as a scleral optometrist, to get the treatment and visual clarity your eyes need. Lens Crafting After the examination, your optometrist sends the prescription to a lab where your lenses will be crafted. Here, a machine cuts the lens into the shape advised by your optometrist based on your prescription’s specifications. Lens Finishing Lastly, your lenses undergo additional treatments. These can include anti reflective or scratch resistant coatings, color tints, or UV protection. These coatings improve the clarity and durability of your lenses. Types of Prescription Lenses There are various types of prescription lenses available to correct vision problems and suit individual needs. These lenses are typically used in eyeglasses and may include single vision lenses, with a single prescription power throughout the entire lens. They correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. Bifocals have two different prescription powers in a single lens. The upper part corrects distance vision, while the lower is for near vision. They are commonly prescribed for individuals who have difficulty seeing both up close and at a distance. This condition is often seen in people over 40 with presbyopia. There are other specialty lenses available for specific needs, such as sports goggles and lenses for low vision individuals. The type of prescription lens you need depends on your vision correction requirements and lifestyle. An eye care professional will assess your vision and recommend the most suitable lens type for your needs. Lumen Optometric is one of the area’s leading eye specialists.

Blog eye care Vision and Headaches: Are They Linked to Each Other?Vision and Headaches: Are They Linked to Each Other? July 7, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Occasional headaches can be manageable for some people. But when these headaches begin to affect your eyesight or if your vision problems start coinciding with headaches, it can be a lot harder for anyone to bear. In this post, Lumen Optometric a trusted provider of eyeglasses and contact lenses discusses how headaches and vision can be interconnected. Types of Headaches That Can Affect Your Vision Migraines and cluster headaches are the usual types of headache that can affect your vision. Migraines are often described as intense pain in and around the eyes. A “migraine aura” usually precedes them, and it often resembles flashing lights, a prismatic rainbow of lights, or a zigzag pattern of shimmering lights. Meanwhile, cluster headaches usually occur in clusters and cause pain around the eyes. The pain typically radiates down the neck including the shoulders and comes with other symptoms like red eyes, changes in pupil size, eyelid droop, and nasal drainage. Vision Problems That Can Trigger Headaches Headaches caused by vision problems usually start when the eyes are overworked and you can’t maintain focus. Make sure to visit an eye exam doctor if you are experiencing any of the following: Eye Strain – This is common among people who work in front of digital screens for several hours and so they tend to overuse the focusing muscles of their eyes. When eye muscles become fatigued, a headache can be felt specifically around or behind the eyes. Farsightedness – A frontal headache or brow ache may occur if a person is farsighted. Farsightedness can make it difficult for a person to focus on nearby objects, making it possible for eye strain and headaches to develop. Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma (AACG) – A rare type of glaucoma, it causes the eye pressure to rise quickly and often results in eye pain, eye redness, cloudy vision, and an onset of headaches.

In fact, any changes to your vision should always be taken seriously lest they become serious. Vision changes refer to any alterations in your ability to see properly–and they are caused by a great number of things. The premier expert in neurolens treatment, Lumen Optometric, discusses vision changes and what you should know about them. What Causes Vision Changes Vision changes may stem from the eyes themselves or may be caused by many different conditions that affect the entire body. The most common reasons for these alterations are refractive errors, including myopia or nearsightedness and presbyopia or age related farsightedness, which affects your ability to focus on objects at a specific distance. And while anyone can suffer from vision changes, the elderly are more prone to them because of possible chronic conditions that affect eyesight. Aside from refractive errors, the following conditions may cause changes in your vision: Age related macular degeneration.Cataracts, or the clouding or loss of transparency in the lens of the eye.Dry eyes, which may be caused by blocked tear ducts, and will require dry eye treatment.Retinal detachment.Eye infections, such as pink eye or sty.Injuries to the eye because of work related accidents or otherwise. Symptoms of Vision Changes Any changes in your vision should be dealt with promptly to prevent eye conditions. When overlooked, these can lead to possible vision loss. You might want to visit your trusted local eye doctor immediately should you experience the following: Eye painRedness of the eyesBlurred visionIncreased sensitivity to lightDouble visionDischarge from the eyesItchiness and other irritationDroopy eyelidDecreased vision in dimly lit settingsInflammation Detecting Root Cause of Vision Changes There’s only one thing to do–visit a premier scleral optometrist like Lumen Optometric immediately for a comprehensive eye exam.

February 11, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Whether you’re working in a desk job or you’re attending online classes, there’s a big possibility that you keep looking at a computer screen for hours on end. As such, you may experience migraines from time to time. Migraines can cause slight discomfort and may even affect your vision and ability to see clearly. There are two types of migraine you might have heard of: visual and ocular. While both migraines involve changes in your vision, there are ways to tell them apart. Lumen Optometric, known for quality dry eye treatment services, explains the difference between visual and ocular migraines. Visual Migraine Visual migraine is a temporary visual impairment that may occur simultaneously in both eyes. Most visual migraines last for 30 minutes, but depending on your stress levels and overall health, they may last longer. You may also experience a migraine headache shortly after a visual migraine. The symptoms of visual migraine may vary. These include: Flickering blind spot in the center or near the center of your peripheral fieldA wavy or zigzag ring of colored light surrounding a blind spotA blind spot that slowly migrates across your line of vision If you frequently experience any of these symptoms, you should consider contacting your optometrist for a neurolens treatment. Ocular Migraine Ocular migraine, on the other hand, is a rarer type of migraine. Unlike visual migraine, ocular migraine only affects one eye. It causes temporary loss of vision, which occurs when there is reduced blood flow in the eye. Ocular migraines can also be triggered because of blood vessel spasms in the retina. It typically lasts for about an hour, and vision eventually returns. In addition, the most common symptom of ocular migraine is the appearance of a blind spot. This blind spot affects your field of vision and normally appears first in the center. As the migraine worsens, the blind spot grows and gradually blocks your entire field of vision. A migraine headache may also occur before, during, or after you experience ocular migraine. Visual and ocular migraines are usually nothing to be worried about, and they will resolve themselves within an hour or less. Nevertheless, if these types of migraine headaches persist, be sure to book an appointment with your eye doctor. Are you looking for a professional scleral optometrist in your area?

Blog eye care VR Headsets: Are They Bad for the Eyes?VR Headsets: Are They Bad for the Eyes? October 14, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Virtual reality (VR) headsets are becoming more commonplace and are now being used for applications other than gaming and entertainment. Since VR headsets deliver audiovisual content, Lumen Optometric takes a look at whether or not VR headsets are bad for the eyes. How Do VR Headsets Work? VR headsets are head mounted devices that consist of a display screen and stereo earpieces, as well as sensors and controllers that create an interactive and immersive experience. Putting on a VR headset shuts out the immediate surroundings, which means the user can only see the content projected on the display screen. Its sensors adjust the content orientation, which allows the user to interact with a virtual space from any direction. While mostly known for their gaming applications, VR headsets can also be used for work and education. The Effects of VR on the Eyes Similar to devices that deliver audiovisual content like TVs and smartphones, VR headsets present the same risks, including eye strain and fatigue, discomfort, and blurred vision. Studies have shown that the human eye tends to blink less when using digital screens. Blinking helps remove contaminants from the eyes and keeps them moist and a reduced blink rate can result in dry eyes. The eyes also tend to work more as the brain tries to reconcile the differences between virtual and perceived depths. VR headsets also induce visually induced motion sickness in some people. This “cybersickness” can persist long after the user has stopped wearing the headset, the symptoms of which include headaches, lightheadedness, difficulty focusing, sweating, and nausea. People who are prone to motion sickness or already have problems that affect their depth perception are especially susceptible to cybersickness. How to Take Care of Your Eyes if You Use VR Headsets Fortunately, there are things that you can do to help reduce the effects of wearing VR headsets. The following can also be helpful if your daily routine involves prolonged use of digital screens: Follow the “20 20 20 Rule”. Take breaks from using your VR headset and follow the 20 20 20 rule: for every 20 minutes you spend looking at a screen, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Moisturize your eyes. In addition to taking regular breaks, apply eye drops to keep your eyes moist. Limit your usage. Don’t use the VR headset longer than you have to, particularly during late hours. In addition to eye strain, the constant exposure to blue light emitted by the screen can affect your body’s melatonin production and affect your sleep cycles. Lastly, visit your eye doctor regularly to prevent further eye problems.

In fact, they’re a component of your immune system that prevents infection, with tears containing water and salt to moisten your eyes as you blink. Sometimes, the glands under your eyelids may produce too many tears. When it discharges through your tear ducts, they become overwhelmed, resulting in watery eyes. This usually gets resolved without treatment, but if this is a recurring problem, refrain from wearing any contact lenses and have your eyes checked at a trusted eye center. Common Causes Normally, you produce excess tears when you feel certain emotions, as well as when you laugh, vomit, cough, yawn, or experience strong taste sensations. However, in some cases, the cause for watery eyes can also be dry eye syndrome. With extremely dry eyes, you’re not able to receive proper lubrication and you’ll keep producing excess tears. This happens if your tears don’t contain the right balance of water, salt, and oils. Your eyes become irritated which causes the overproduction of tears to spill through your tear ducts. Knowing When to See a Doctor Normally, your watery eyes will clear up without any treatment. But if it keeps happening, you’ll have to see your trusted eye exam doctor for a check up. They’ll be able to determine the cause of your dry eyes so they can administer the best treatment. Sometimes, the causes can be as simple as an injured or scratched eye. It can also be as obvious as swollen or red eyes. But other symptoms can also be tenderness around your nose or sinuses, as well as a severe headache associated with your watery eyes.

Blog eye care What Are Myopia Treatment Benefits?What Are Myopia Treatment Benefits? March 14, 2023 by Vic Doce In this blog, discover the benefits of treating myopia early. Myopia is one of the most common vision issues among children, with 1 in 3 being myopic. It’s an epidemic that is projected to affect half of the world’s population by the year 2050. At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to give children better vision for life so they can accomplish their goals and avoid other serious vision problems in the future. Short Term Benefits of Myopia Treatment Some of the short term benefits of myopia treatment include increased confidence in your child, better vision to engage more actively in school and other activities, and an overall better quality of life. 1\\\\. Improved vision: Treehouse Eyes offers a holistic approach to myopia management. Specializing in treatment options for myopia, Treehouse Eyes doctors take into account a child’s background, genetics, and lifestyle. After evaluation, your child will receive proper treatment for myopia such as contact lenses or prescription eye drops. 2\\\\. Better academic performance: Children with myopia may often experience difficulty reading the board or seeing the screen in a classroom setting. It can also cause a lack of confidence to speak up in class because of their vision impairment. Treating myopia can help your child see clearly and give them the confidence to engage academically. 3\\\\. Reduce Eye Strain: Children with myopia may experience headaches and other symptoms from trying to focus on distant objects. Myopia treatment can help alleviate these symptoms for your child. 4\\\\. Increased quality of life: Treating myopia early on can help improve your child’s confidence by allowing them to participate in a wider range of activities. This can also help them excel at hobbies they currently struggle with due to their vision. Some studies show the relationship between myopia and mental health issues. Myopia management can lead to improved mental health and overall happiness for your child. Long term Benefits of Myopia Treatment There are numerous long term benefits to treating myopia early on, which is where the Treehouse Eyes mission, “giving children better vision for life,” comes into play. 1\\\\. Reduce the risk of serious eye diseases: High myopia can lead to other serious eye diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachments, macular degeneration, and cataracts. Early intervention to treat myopia is key so your Treehouse Eyes doctor can greatly reduce those risks for your child. 2\\\\. More Career Prospects: Some careers may require good vision such as the military, aviation industry, surgeons and paramedics, or any rescue team such as a firefighter or a lifeguard. By slowing down the progression of myopia, your child will have a larger range of opportunities and won’t be held back by their myopia. 3\\\\. Lower healthcare costs: Treating myopia early might save your child higher vision care costs. Treatment of other eye diseases can be expensive, so the earlier myopia is treated, the less likely it could lead to an eye disease that is more serious. 4\\\\. Overall Improved Quality of Life: People with myopia may experience day to day difficulties with things such as difficulties driving, playing sports, or reading. Early intervention for myopia is key and can improve overall vision making daily activities easier and more enjoyable. Let TreeHouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor. Schedule a consultation now to find out more.

Blog eye care What Are Toric Lenses For?What Are Toric Lenses For? October 12, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Astigmatism is a fairly common eye condition: about one in three people suffer from this condition. The cornea (the clear outer surface of the eyes) of patients with astigmatism is shaped more like a football instead of a perfectly round ball (which is the ideal shape for your eyes). This irregular curve bends light more in one direction and causes blurry vision. Fortunately, moderate astigmatism can be easily corrected using toric contact lenses. How are toric lenses different from normal contact lenses? Lumen Optometric, your trusted scleral optometrist, elaborates on the key features of toric lenses below: How the Shape of Toric Lenses Is Different Normal contacts have are spherical shaped whereas toric lenses are shaped like the side of a donut. Thanks to this unique shape, toric lenses have different refractive powers that can correct astigmatism. They also have a small weight in their edges make sure your contacts return to their proper alignment after you blink. (Whenever you blink, the contacts on your eye rotate.) Why It’s Important That Your Toric Contacts Fit Well It’s important that your contacts fit properly, but it’s especially so for toric lenses. That’s because ill fitting toric lenses that slip easily won’t be able to improve the clarity of your vision. What Are the Different Types of Toric Lenses? Toric lenses are either made of soft or hard (also known as rigid gas permeable) lenses. Soft lenses are comfortable to wear, but hard lenses which are more likely to stay in place tend to perform better than soft lenses. However, it usually takes a longer time to adjust to hard lenses. If you want to learn more about toric lenses as well as other treatment options, like neurolens treatment, for other vision conditions, consult your eye doctor. Looking for eye specialists near you?

If you have plans with your soon to be spouse, know that you don’t have to ditch your spectacles, especially if they are what makes you distinct in terms of personality. Here are some pieces of advice from Lumen Optometric to help you get the most out of the look on your wedding day. Make Your Glasses a Statement Piece You won’t be hard pressed to find a stylish set of frames nowadays. In addition to vision correction, they can help enhance your appearance, especially when you wear your wedding outfit. If you are getting a new pair before your big day, be sure that you treat it like jewelry. In other words, it should complement your dress or suit. Schedule a Custom Fitting Don’t go for the first frames you see right from the shelf. Schedule a custom fitting with your future spouse so you can find the perfect pair of eyeglasses that will match the style you’re looking for. Your eye exam doctor can help you choose which frames suit you best, taking note of the shape and other details of your face as a guide. You’ll want them to be of the perfect size and fit, so you can wear them from the wedding ceremony at church to the reception venue. Minimize the Glare It’s one thing to get the perfect frame size and style, but it’s also another thing to get the best prescription possible for vision correction. Your current prescription may no longer work for you, and your next visit to your eye doctor is essential for determining whether you need a new one. While you’re at it, why not ask about anti reflective options? Expect many photo ops at the wedding march and the reception, so lenses with this feature are a must have for your new specs. At Lumen Optometric, we want to make sure that you will get the best pair of eyewear possible that fits this important occasion. Apart from this, you can count on us to provide other exceptional eye care services, including neurolens therapy and corneal reshaping.

That’s because the lack of lubrication increases the friction between the eyes and contacts, increasing discomfort for lens wearers. Using artificial tears can help alleviate symptoms of dry eye. However, certain formulations work better than others. That’s why if you need dry eye treatment, it’s best to consult your local eye doctor. Keratoconus – This is a progressive disease that causes corneas (the outer layer at the front of your eye that’s responsible for focusing light) to become thinner and bulge outward into a cone shape. The cornea’s irregular shape distorts a patient’s vision and makes fitting contacts harder. Does This Mean Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes Still Wear Contacts? Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes need to wear custom molded scleral lenses, which are larger than gas permeable contact lenses. Thanks to their large size, they can cover the entire corneal surface. Since scleral lenses rest on the less sensitive part of the sclera or the white outer layer of the eye, patients with Keratoconus don’t usually experience discomfort when using them. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including scleral lens fitting and neurolens treatment services. Our proprietor Dr. Eric To is the only practice owning optometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society. As such, you can rest easy knowing that our team has undergone advanced training to provide the clearest and healthiest vision for our patients.

Blog eye care What Causes Myopia?What Causes Myopia? May 10, 2021 by Lumen Optometric The drastic increase in the number of children diagnosed with myopia during the past decade is astonishing but is it surprising? Not really. When you analyze the causes of myopia, it becomes clear why more and more children are becoming affected by this progressive eye disease. What Is Myopia? Myopia, often referred to as nearsightedness, is an eye disease in which the eye elongates more than it should, causing light to be focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina’s surface. Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors lead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status. Genetics A child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or your spouse are myopic. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all over the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day, whether reading a book, using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or another device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially in excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and progression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration of near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating novel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a magazine a few minutes at a time. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Other Risk Factors Associated with Myopia Height taller children and adolescents have a higher incidence of myopia than their shorter counterpartsEducation level There is a higher incidence of myopia in people with advanced degrees, as well as higher parental education levels.Ethnicity Individuals from Asian Pacific Islander communities are more at risk of developing myopia. If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease. At Treehouse Eyes, we offer the latest and most effective myopia management treatments to limit the progression of myopia so that your child can live his or her best life.

So, how can you make your home safer for your eyes? A few simple practices can significantly reduce the risk of accidental eye injuries. Continue reading to learn why practicing eye safety at home is important and how to maintain good eye health. The Importance of Eye Safety at Home Eye safety at home is essential for several reasons. For one, it helps prevent accidents and injuries that can lead to vision problems. Many preventable eye injuries occur right in the comfort of our homes. From minor irritations to major injuries, our eyes face potential hazards from everyday household items. Therefore, having an eye safety routine can go a long way in preventing eye health issues. Furthermore, eye safety at home is indispensable for preserving your vision and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By being proactive and taking necessary precautions, you can reduce the risk of eye injuries and conditions that may have a lasting impact on your visual health. Maintaining Your Eye Health at Home Paying attention to your eye health is essential for preserving your vision and preventing eye related problems. Here are some tips to maintain healthy eyes. Regular Eye Examinations One way to keep your eyes healthy is to have regular eye exams with your doctor. These exams help catch potential vision issues early and allow your doctor to prescribe corrective glasses or contact lenses or recommend other necessary treatments. Protective Eyewear Whether you’re doing crafts, cleaning your home, or mowing the garden, wear protective eyewear. Goggles, for instance, form a physical barrier between your eyes and potential hazards, minimizing the risk of eye injury. Safe Use of Cosmetics and Cleaning Products If improperly used or stored, cosmetics and cleaning products pose a significant eye hazard. Therefore, consider eye safety while using and storing these substances and close your products securely. Adopting Healthy Habits Adequate nutrition, regular breaks from screen time, and ensuring sufficient lighting while reading and working are simple yet effective practices to keep your eyes healthy. Monitoring Vision Changes Take note of any changes in your vision. Contact your eye care professional immediately if you feel discomfort or notice changes. If you want to schedule an analysis of your eye health, contact Lumen Optometric at or fill out our online form to schedule a consultation. We also offer other services, such as orthokeratology, myopia management and neurolens therapy.

Blog eye care What Should You Ask Your Doctor During an Eye Exam?What Should You Ask Your Doctor During an Eye Exam? June 14, 2022 by Lumen Optometric An annual eye exam is one of the best ways to keep your eyes healthy. Since you’ll only be seeing your eye doctor once a year, you need to make the most of it. That includes asking the important questions pertaining to the current state of your eyesight. Lumen Optometric lists some of them below. “Are My Eyes Healthy?” If your doctor detects a disease during the eye exam such as age related macular degeneration or glaucoma, they will educate you thoroughly and advise you how to safeguard your eyes. However, even if you haven’t been diagnosed with such, it’s best to prioritize your wellness, especially when it comes to your vision. Be sure to ask your doctor if there are ways to improve your vision and ocular health. They will be able to present you with options to retain your healthy eyesight. “Are There Any Changes I Should Do to Protect My Eyes?” Several eye diseases have been linked to UV exposure, from cataracts to eye cancers. Sunglasses can prevent these issues, but your eye doctor may recommend UV blocking contact lenses to block the peripheral light that sunglasses cannot block. If you are already wearing a contact lens, you can replace your lenses as prescribed by your doctor. “Are Digital Devices Affecting My Eyesight?” More than 83% of Americans use digital devices for more than two hours each day, which can lead to digital eye strain. Common symptoms include eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes. During the eye exam, your eye doctor can suggest several tips to alleviate digital eye strain. These may include offering dry eye treatment, changing the lighting and display settings, or wearing specialized prescriptions, including contact lenses. “When Should I Return for My Next Visit?” Depending on your age, vision, and medical history, your eye doctor will determine how often you need an exam. Staying on schedule is crucial, especially if you have underlying eye conditions that need to be treated. Most eye care centers may schedule your next appointment right away. Otherwise, be sure to set a reminder on your phone. Here at Lumen Optometric, our eye care professionals are happy to assist you with your eye health concerns. We also provide top quality eye care services, including neurolens treatment and more. Give us a call at or fill out our online contact form to book an appointment.

Children frequently experience myopia progression, which lowers their quality of life and increases risks to their eye health. Myopia control treatments are now able to improve children’s vision and promote long term eye health. Read on to find out more! What is Myopia? People with myopia have blurred vision when looking at objects from a distance. When myopia worsens, the blur can become noticeable even when the object is close to or at arm’s length. Near sightedness or short sightedness are other names for it. Myopia usually begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 14 and generally becomes progressively worse every several months in children. It results from the eyes’ rapid and excessive expansion relative to the usual pace of eye growth. The eyes should continue to expand consistently in size until adolescence, then stabilize. However, with myopia, the eyes develop too quickly, causing rapid and continuous vision loss as well as ongoing eye growth into adolescence and even early adulthood. Myopia progression is the term used to describe this continuing deterioration. What is Myopia Control? The use of treatments intended to stop the advancement of myopia is known as “myopia control.” These treatments include atropine eye drops, soft contact lenses, ortho k, and special types of glasses. Myopia control is especially crucial for children, as it is in this age group that myopia is most likely to progress or worsen quickly. Both myopia management and myopia control are phrases used to refer to the additional clinical care needed for myopic children and adults. Myopia control typically entails using eye drops, contacts, or glasses to stop the progression of myopia. Myopia control is a broad term that encompasses maintaining eye health as well as various lifestyle and environmental factors that may contribute to the advancement of myopia. What are The Advantages of Myopia Control? The primary advantage of treating myopia is to reduce the risks associated with high myopia. Those with high degrees of myopia will have increased risk for diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachments, and myopic maculopathy. Myopia requires the use of spectacles or contact lenses to treat blurry distance vision. If your myopia is lower, you will be more functional in the mornings before putting on your contacts or glasses. You’ll be able to work a little better without them as opposed to becoming totally incapacitated without them. Additionally, a lower prescription increases the likelihood that your child will be a good candidate for laser eye surgery as an adult to correct their myopia, as well as the likelihood that they will have better visual results after surgery. What Else Should I know? Numerous studies have demonstrated that a child’s or teen’s visual environment can raise their chances of developing and progressing myopia. When creating the visual environment, do increase the duration of outdoor time your child has. Talk to your eye doctor or optometrist about the ideal duration they should spend outdoors and on screens and or reading to control your child’s myopia. These can play a significant role in ensuring the optimum results from myopia control treatments.

Always be careful when participating in activities that involve sharp items and flying objects. One way to ensure your eyes are safe while you’re playing sports is wearing the proper safety eyewear. Keep in mind that conventional glasses won’t give your eyes the protection they need. A local eye exam doctor shares facts about sports eye safety. Blinding Injuries Can Occur From Combat Sports People participating in boxing and full contact martial arts are at significant risk of severe eye injuries that can lead to blindness. While there’s no standard eye protection for boxing, using thumbless gloves can help reduce eye injuries related to the sport. Basketball Is the Leading Cause of Sports Related Injuries Most sports related eye injuries in the U.S. occur while playing basketball. It is followed by softball, baseball, airsoft rifles, pellet guns, racquetball and hockey. When playing these sports, you must wear protective glasses with shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses. It pays to invest in protective eyewear that meets the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. At Lumen Optometric, we’re here to help choose which glasses or contact lenses are most suitable for your activity. Consider Your Risks If one of your eyes already has reduced vision, think hard before participating in a sport with a high risk of eye injury. Are you willing to risk your other eye? Consult your eye doctor to find out what kind of eye protection you need. They might also advise or discourage you from playing high risk sports, depending on the condition of your eyes.

This is especially bad when the person has ocular misalignment, allowing for a condition termed trigeminal dysphoria. The premier corneal reshaping specialist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares more details about trigeminal dysphoria and how you can alleviate its symptoms. Who is At Risk of Trigeminal Dysphoria? People who experience trigeminal dysphoria–about 90% of them, in fact, according to studies–have ocular misalignment when viewing nearby objects instead of at a distance. This means their regular and continued use of digital devices becomes even more problematic since the task involves full on near vision. To compensate for this problem, their vision must work overtime. This, in turn, puts a strain on the trigeminal nerve–the largest and most complex nerve connected to the brain. When the trigeminal nerve is triggered, these allow for symptoms that include headaches, eye strain, light sensitivity, and neck and shoulder pain. How Do You Confirm You Have Trigeminal Dysphoria? The symptoms mentioned above are also associated with a number of eye conditions. To determine whether you actually have trigeminal dysphoria, you should visit a trusted local eye exam doctor like Lumen Optometric. Our trained and skilled eye care specialists will perform a comprehensive checkup of your eyes and accurately determine the root of its problem. If the results are indeed trigeminal dysphoria, we can offer a safe and effective way to alleviate its symptoms. What is Neurolens Treatment Technology? Lumen Optometric is the only neurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley. With the use of advanced and customized lenses, we can correct your specific ocular misalignment so you won’t have to struggle to see up close or far away. This means a reduced potential for symptoms involved with trigeminal dysphoria, allowing only for the most comfortable vision possible. Neurolens utilizes different technology to conventional contact lenses. To ensure you get the specialized lenses that can perfectly fit your eyes and help with your specific symptoms, Lumen Optometric will measure your eye misalignment using sophisticated equipment, SightSync. You’ll start noticing vision improvements with neuronlens within the week–those with extremely chronic conditions, however, may require at least six weeks before they can see the difference.

October 12, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Have you ever asked, “Why are my eyes so dry?” Turns out, this is not an uncommon issue, and many face it, especially in this digital age. There could be multiple reasons, from environmental factors to something more serious. Read on to learn more about dry eyes, including the main causes and treatment options. Main Causes of Dry Eyes Several factors can contribute to dry eyes: Aging. With age, our tear production naturally decreases. This is why people over 50 are more likely to experience dry eye symptoms. Gender. Hormonal changes, particularly during pregnancy, using oral contraceptives or menopause, can cause dry eyes in women. Environmental Conditions. Dry, windy, smoky or dusty conditions can increase tear evaporation. Also, spending long hours looking at the computer screen can reduce the blink rate, drying your eyes out. Medications. Certain drugs, including antihistamines, decongestants, blood pressure medications and antidepressants, can reduce tear production. Health Conditions. Certain health issues can cause dry eyes, such as Sjogren’s syndrome, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid problems. How to Treat Dry Eyes Treatment for dry eyes typically aims at restoring or maintaining the normal amount of tears in the eye to minimize dryness and related discomfort. Here are some of the most common: Artificial Tears. Over the counter eye drops that mimic your natural tears may relieve mild cases of dry eyes. Lifestyle Changes. Taking breaks during long tasks, avoiding air blowing in your eyes and adding moisture to the air at home or work can help. Prescription Medications. Certain prescription drugs can help increase tear production. Special Procedures. In severe cases, various procedures can be used, like closing your tear ducts to reduce tear loss or using special contact lenses. If you’ve tried home care methods and over the counter solutions without success, it’s time to see a doctor. Seek immediate medical attention if you have: Unbearable eye discomfort A significant decrease in vision Other symptoms like redness, swelling or discharge Dry Eye Treatment at Lumen Optometric At Lumen Optometric, we understand that every individual is unique.

August 3, 2021 by Lumen Optometric People who get new eyeglasses can sometimes experience discomfort. Some get nose pain and marks, while others feel eye strain or ear pain. To avoid these issues when getting new glasses or contact lenses, it is important to work with a reliable eye care professional. Here are possible reasons your new eyeglasses might be uncomfortable to wear. Your Eyeglasses Are Loose If your eyeglasses feel like they are falling every time you move, it could be that they are too loose around your ears. You can try to run your glasses under warm water and slightly bend the temple arms down. Another solution is to get eyeglasses in smaller frames that best fit your face shape. You Have a Low Nose Bridge You may have a low nose bridge if your eyeglasses slip down when you tilt your head. If this is the case, you may need the help of your eye exam doctor to find glasses that are suitable for lower nose bridges. They may suggest getting rectangular or horn rimmed glasses. Moreover, you can also try adjusting the nose pads of your glasses inward, so they sit more securely to your nose. Your Glasses Are Not Set Correctly When glasses leave marks on your nose bridge, it could be that they are not set correctly. It is easy to adjust the nose pads of your glasses, so they sit on your nose properly. Your optician may also adjust them or change them with another material, such as silicone, acetate, or nylon. If you have a plastic frame, it’s possible that they are too heavy or the bridge may not be big enough. You may want to consider investing in eyeglass frames with a wider bridge or lighter weight lenses. Incorrect Pupillary Distance Measurement You may still get headaches from properly sized eyeglasses if it has an incorrect pupillary distance (PD) measurement. PD refers to the distance between your pupils and is necessary for eyeglass wear comfort. Mistakes on PD are common for people who get their prescription glasses. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care needs. Besides glasses and contacts, we also offer neuro lens and corneal reshaping therapy.

September 6, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Your eyes and vision will reach complete development by the time you’re in your early 20s. Usually, you won’t notice significant changes in your vision until your 40s. It isn’t uncommon for older adults to experience difficulty in reading small print or need more light to see clearly. Learn why it happens from a local orthokeratology specialist. Aging Eyes: Why Do They Need More Light? In your 40s, the lenses of your eyes can start to turn yellow and get more rigid. It can reduce the amount of light that enters your eyes and affect color accuracy and focus. As you age, your corneas can thicken and become more opaque. Your pupils can also begin to shrink. These changes can further decrease and diffuse the light that reaches your eyes. Individuals who are 65 and older might need more light to see clearly. Their eyes might take longer to adjust from light to dark environments and vice versa. It can be more challenging for older adults to focus on nearby objects. They can also experience sensitivity to glare. Tips to Help You Adjust to Vision Changes See Your Eye Doctor Regularly Regardless of age, you must see an eye exam doctor regularly. Doing so helps in detecting and treating vision threatening conditions in their early stages. Macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the most common eye problems in older adults. They don’t usually show early signs, and you might not know you have them until they have progressed. Make Necessary Changes to Your Home People who are 65 and older often need twice as much light as young adults to see well. You can make your living space safer by increasing ambient light. Consider adding dimmer switches so each family member can easily adjust the room’s illumination depending on their needs. Place task lighting wherever they are necessary. It’s also essential that light switches are easy to access. Don’t wait for your vision to change before seeing an eye doctor. For personalized eye care services, turn to Lumen Optometric.

If you have a job that requires you to use the computer for hours, make sure to give your eyes a break every once in a while. Practice Healthy Contact Lens Wear Contact lenses are a great option for people who don’t prefer to wear glasses. Using contacts is safe as long you practice good hygiene, wear them properly, and follow your eye doctor’s recommendations. You should avoid wearing contacts for extended periods, reusing old solution, and handling lenses without washing your hands. Avoid Constant Eye Rubbing While it may be tempting to rub your eyes when they are itchy, you shouldn’t. Doing so will only worsen the problem and put too much pressure on your eyes or even scratch them. You can use a cold compress if your eyes keep itching. If it feels like there’s something inside your eye, gently flush it with water. However, if the sensation persists, it’s best to see your eye doctor. Wear Proper Eye Protection The sun’s ultraviolet rays can be extremely harmful to your eyes. When going outside, make sure to wear UV blocking sunglasses. Moreover, use protective eyewear when swimming, cooking with oil, doing home improvements, and other activities that risk eye injuries or involve chemicals.

June 17, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Cataracts are commonly associated with the elderly; however, children and young adults can also develop them. It might sound surprising, but various circumstances and conditions can result in cataracts at any age. Let’s explore how cataracts aren’t strictly an age related condition. Dispelling the Misconception About Age and Cataracts While cataracts are most common among the elderly, it is a fallacy to say they are exclusively an age related condition. For various reasons, children and young adults can also develop cataracts, even if they’re wearing contact lenses. For instance, newborns can be afflicted with cataracts, a condition known as congenital cataracts. This congenital eye problem can be hereditary or caused by infections during pregnancy. Likewise, young adults can acquire what are known as secondary cataracts due to certain diseases like diabetes or lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Symptoms and Detection of Cataracts in Young People Symptoms of cataracts can be quite similar across all age groups, including blurred or cloudy vision and difficulty with night vision. Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial to detecting and managing this condition early. Your eye exam doctor is instrumental in this process, identifying signs that may be overlooked without professional evaluation. Management and Treatment of Pediatric and Young Adult Cataracts Treatment options for cataracts in young people depend on the severity of the condition and the individual’s age. In some cases, glasses or contact lenses may be sufficient to improve vision. For more advanced cataracts, surgery to remove the clouded lens and replace it with an artificial one may be necessary.

Blog eye health Eye Vitamins: Can They Improve Vision?Eye Vitamins: Can They Improve Vision? May 20, 2024 by Lumen Optometric It’s tempting to imagine that better eyesight can be achieved simply by adding a few vitamins to your daily routine. Although certain vitamins can influence eye health, these shouldn’t replace a well balanced diet. Before you rush off to buy these supplements, it’s important to note that these over the counter vitamins may not always bring the desired results and could sometimes even cause harm. Find out what the experts say regarding the effects of eye vitamins. What Are Over the Counter Eye Vitamins? Over the counter eye vitamins are non prescription supplements that may have the potential to enhance your eye health. You can find them in various forms, from tablets and capsules to liquid and powder. Can Eye Vitamins Improve Vision? Some studies suggest that specific vitamins may promote eye health and improve vision. However, these supplements don’t guarantee vision improvement for everyone. Their effect can differ based on individual health conditions and lifestyle. Vitamins That Can Influence Vision and Eye Health Several vitamins prove essential in maintaining healthy eyes. For instance, vitamins A, C and E are antioxidant vitamins that can help prevent age related macular degeneration, a leading cause of severe vision loss. On the other hand, B vitamins such as niacin and folic acid may reduce the risk of certain eye conditions. Balanced Diet vs. Supplement Intake Despite the potential benefits of these vitamins, remember that the safest and most effective way to acquire these nutrients is via a balanced diet. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats can provide the essential nutrients your body needs for overall health, including your eyes. Supplements should not replace a balanced diet but can serve as an excellent additional tool in case of deficiency or certain health conditions. Importance of Consultation Before Taking Supplements Think twice before grabbing eye vitamins off the shelf! Before beginning any dietary supplement regimen, let your eye doctor guide you on the best approach to supporting your eye health. Self prescription could lead to overconsumption, which can potentially cause health risks. If you need expert advice on any eye health concerns, contact Lumen Optometric.

Prolonged screen time can overwork your eyes and lead to eye strain, but the good news is that there are simple exercises that can help relax and refresh your eyes. Lumen Optometric, your go to provider of orthokeratology and other eye care solutions, shares five exercises that are specifically designed to minimize eye discomfort. Eye Strain Explained Also known as asthenopia, eye strain is a common condition characterized by discomfort in and around the eyes. These are often caused by activities requiring intense use of the eyes, such as reading, driving, or screen time, and the usual symptoms include dryness, redness, blurred vision, light sensitivity, and headaches. When you constantly fix your gaze on digital screens, your eyes have to incessantly focus and refocus, causing eye strain. Exercises To Prevent Eye Strain The following simple exercises can significantly reduce eye strain when incorporated into your daily routine: The 20 20 20 Rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break and look at something 20 feet away. This technique allows your eyes to rest from the intensity of the computer or smartphone screen. Blinking. This refreshes and moistens your eyes, which can prevent dryness and irritation. Palming. Rub your palms together to warm them, then place them gently over your closed eyes. Feel your eyes relax while you breathe deeply. Eye Rolling. Close your eyes and roll them gently in a circular motion. This helps to relieve tension around the eyes. Focusing Exercises. Hold your thumb six inches away from your face and focus on it for five seconds. Then, focus on an object 20 feet away for another five seconds. Switch back and forth. This exercise helps train your eyes. The Importance of Professional Eye Care While these eye exercises can help prevent eye strain, it’s equally important to have regular, comprehensive eye checks done by an eye exam doctor. These exams will help in the early identification of any potential eye related issues. Let Lumen Optometric Take Care of Your Vision Eye strain is a widespread issue, but the good news is that it can be managed effectively through regular exercises and professional eye care.

Unfortunately, it also brings factors that can affect your eye health and vision. Understanding these factors can help you protect your eyesight and enjoy all winter offers without worry or discomfort. Complications of Cold Weather on Eye Health During colder temperatures, your eyes may suffer several complications that warrant an eye exam. Dry Eyes: The cold weather often reduces the amount of moisture in the air, resulting in dry eyes for many people. Due to reduced humidity levels inside homes or offices and increased wind speeds, it can be difficult for tears to form normally. This can lead to irritation, redness, itching and burning sensations around the eyes that may cause further complications if left untreated. Wind and Dust: During colder temperatures, wind gusts are much stronger than usual, which increases dust particles being blown into our eyes. This can cause irritation and potential damage to sensitive structures within our ocular areas, such as the conjunctiva (the white part) or cornea (the clear front layer). Sun Glare: With sun glare reflecting off ice crystals in the sky combined with strong winds blowing snowflakes across areas where there should be little obstruction from sunlight, there is an increased risk for UV exposure. This can cause temporary issues such as headaches and long term damage, including age related macular degeneration (AMD), over prolonged periods if protection isn’t taken seriously. Prevention Tips for Eye Health in Winter Here’s what you can do to protect your eyes from the cold: Wear Protective Eyewear: Wearing protective eyewear will help reduce exposure levels significantly while allowing us to see better under harsh conditions. Protective eyewear contains polarized lenses providing clearer images even when light reflects off surfaces like bodies of water or icy grounds. We recommend investing in quality frames lenses designed against UV radiation to keep your vision intact. Hydrate: We suggest drinking plenty of fluids throughout days spent outdoors this season, not only because staying hydrated helps fight dryness caused by winds but also because a lack thereof could lead to negative impacts. Take Breaks from Screens: Staring at screens for prolonged periods can cause eyestrain and fatigue, leading to redness, itchiness, dry eyes and other complications. Taking regular breaks from any digital device, especially when wearing contact lenses, helps give your eyes a break so they can rest and recuperate more effectively. Eat Nutritious Foods: Eating nutritious foods rich in vitamins and minerals, such as dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes and oily fish, is important because these substances can help strengthen eye structures against external factors like dryness and wind. They provide nutrients that benefit long term vision health, reducing risks associated with certain conditions, including AMD (age related macular degeneration) and cataracts. Visit an eye exam doctor: If you are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned above or if you have any questions about how to protect your eyes during winter, consult an eye doctor.

This popular festival is a time for silly costumes, eerie décor, and, of course, delicious goodies. Nevertheless, many people are unaware that October is also Halloween Eye Health and Safety Month, a wonderful time to highlight the need to protect your vision during this festive season. At Treehouse Eyes, we believe in preserving your child’s eyesight all year round, ensuring better vision for life. In this blog post, we’ll explore some simple yet effective ways to protect your eyes and ensure a safe and enjoyable Halloween celebration. Choose the Right Costume Accessories: One of the most fun elements of Halloween is dressing up in unique costumes. Yet, certain costume accessories might be hazardous to your eyes. While choosing masks, headgear, and other accessories, use caution. Check that they fit comfortably and do not block your view. Be sure to try and use outfits with transparent, non toxic face paint or cosmetics. Beware of Decorative Contact Lenses: Colored or decorative contact lenses are a popular choice for enhancing Halloween costumes, but they can be dangerous if not worn properly. Only a qualified eye care provider with a valid prescription should be able to get these lenses. To avoid eye infections, never exchange contact lenses with others and adhere to the prescribed cleaning and wearing schedule. Mind the Makeup: Makeup is an important aspect of many Halloween outfits, but be cautious when applying it around your eyes. Use hypoallergenic makeup and avoid applying makeup inside the lash line or straight onto the eyeball for cosmetics safety. To avoid eye discomfort and infection, always remove your makeup before going to bed. Talk to your Eye Doctor: Do you have any questions about what not to wear on Halloween? Are you looking for fun contacts to tske your costume over the top? Trust your eye doctor to answer any questions you have.

It involves damage to the macula, or the part of your eye responsible for sharp, central vision. Symptoms may range from blurred or reduced central vision to distorted vision. AMD may sound scary, but did you know your diet can help significantly manage and prevent it from occurring?

The Role of Diet in AMD When it comes to AMD, it’s fascinating how far reaching the impact of your diet can be.

January 11, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Regular eye exams are an important part of a child’s healthcare. Pediatric eye exams can detect vision problems early and help children develop the skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. A scleral optometrist discusses the ideal schedule for pediatric eye exams here. What Is a Pediatric Eye Exam? A pediatric eye exam is a comprehensive assessment of your child’s eyesight. During the appointment, an optometrist will evaluate how well your child can see from near and far distances, their peripheral vision and depth perception, and any underlying conditions or diseases that could affect their vision. How Often Should Pediatric Eye Exams Be Scheduled? The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that all children receive comprehensive pediatric eye examinations at least once between the ages of 3 to 5 years old, followed by yearly checkups until age 18 (or 21 if still in school). However, certain risk factors may increase the frequency with which these appointments should occur. Issues such as premature birth or family history of ocular diseases, like glaucoma, cataracts, retinopathy, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, strabismus (crossed eyes) and uncorrected refractive error, may make your child prone to certain eye health problems. Even dry eye, a natural part of aging, affect children and require them to undergo dry eye treatment. In these cases, it’s best to consult your optometrist, who will create an individualized plan based on your needs and risk factors in your family history and medical records. What To Expect During An Eye Exam When you bring your little one for an eye exam, the doctor will conduct various tests to assess their eyes’ health and function. These tests may include: Visual acuity test – This measures how your child can see at different distances. Refraction test – An examination to determine whether corrective lenses are needed for optimal vision. Color blindness test – A simple screening tool that checks for color deficiencies. Slit lamp exam – Used to check for any signs of infection or damage on the eye’s surface. Retinoscopy autorefractor – A method doctors use to measure refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. If you’re looking for a comprehensive pediatric eye exam in Sierra Madre, CA, look no further than Lumen Optometric. Our team of experienced optometrists will work with you to ensure that your child’s vision is healthy and they’re seeing their best.

Perhaps they have been struggling to see things clearly from a distance. If so, they might be experiencing a common vision problem known as myopia or nearsightedness. Alarmingly, studies show that childhood myopia rates are on the rise globally. Read on as Lumen Optometric shares crucial insights into this escalating issue, its impact on children’s vision, and how early detection and treatment can make all the difference. Understanding Myopia Myopia, often known as nearsightedness, is a condition where objects up close are seen clearly, while objects farther away appear blurred. Usually developing in childhood, myopia occurs when the eye grows too long, preventing light from focusing directly on the retina. This irregularity causes distant objects to appear blurry, which could mean your child is struggling to see the school board or having difficulty playing sports. How an Eye Exam Doctor Can Help Detect Myopia An eye exam doctor plays a critical role in the early detection of myopia. During your child’s regular eye exams, they can accurately measure your child’s vision and eye health, diagnosing myopia and other potential vision problems. Remember, early intervention can prevent your child’s eyesight issues from worsening. Treatment Options for Childhood Myopia Once diagnosed, effective treatment options are available. One common approach is to prescribe contact lenses. These are usually worn during the day and removed at night, aiding in clear distant vision. Another advanced treatment option is orthokeratology, a non surgical procedure that gradually reshapes the eye’s curvature using specially designed contact lenses. One advantage of this process is that it slows down the progression of myopia in children, providing a more long term solution. How Lumen Optometric Can Help At Lumen Optometric, we’re dedicated to providing comprehensive eye care for your child. Based in Sierra Madre, CA, our team of eye doctors has the expertise to diagnose and treat myopia in children. Rest assured that we use the latest techniques, such as orthokeratology, to ensure optimal results and safeguard your child’s vision for the future.

Eye safety hazards during sports can range from minor scratches to severe trauma that can cause permanent vision loss. Choosing the right sports eye safety gear is crucial to protect your eyes from potential harm. In this article, we explore the different types of sports eye safety gear available and how to choose the right one for your needs. Identifying Your Needs When choosing the right sports eyewear, it is important to consider the type of sport you are playing and the level of intensity. For instance, you may need different protection for a non contact or low intensity sport like golf than for a full contact team sport like football. Choosing the appropriate eye protection will help protect your eyes while allowing you to play comfortably and safely. Features to Consider When selecting the right sports eye safety gear, these are the features you should consider. Fit Regardless of the type of activity you’re participating in, your eye doctor will recommend choosing eyewear that fits. Your eye gear should fit snugly and comfortably without slipping or moving during activity. Look for eyewear with adjustable straps or nose pads to ensure a proper fit. Comfort Your eyewear should also be comfortable to wear for extended periods. Look for soft padding or cushioning around the eyes. Lightweight materials that won’t bother you during activity are also excellent choices. Durability Sports eye safety gear should withstand impact and other potential hazards. Look for durable materials that can withstand rough handling. Polycarbonate lenses or frames made from strong plastics or metals work great for this purpose. Visibility Choose sports eye safety gear that doesn’t impede your vision. It should also provide you with a wide field of vision and have anti fog coatings, so you can see clearly during activity. Additionally, it may be worth investing in impact resistant lenses if you play contact sports. They absorb shock better than regular ones but still provide clear visibility even under extreme conditions. Lens Tint The tint of the lens is also an important consideration as it can affect your vision in different lighting conditions. Clear lenses suit low light conditions, while tinted or polarized lenses can reduce glare and improve visibility in bright sunlight. Shopping Tips Once you have identified your needs, research different brands and read customer reviews to compare features and quality. It is also worth asking for recommendations from friends or family who play the same sport. If you’re looking for eye exam doctors or orthokeratology or optometry specialists in Sierra Madre, CA, to help you pick the right eyewear for your preferred sport, Lumen Optometric can help.

Blog Eyes Is Myopia Hereditary?Is Myopia Hereditary? October 26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is an incredibly prevalent vision condition, affecting around 30% of Americans, with an estimated 20 25 million children untreated in the United States alone. It develops when the eyeball grows longer from front to back than normal, with the symptom of blurry distance vision. Myopia tends to begin in childhood and worsen over time. This leads many to wonder – is nearsightedness genetic? Let’s explore the evidence surrounding myopia’s hereditary patterns. Research Shows a Strong Genetic Link Extensive research, including twin studies, family patterns, and genetic mapping, provides compelling evidence that genetics play a significant role in myopia. While environmental factors can also influence myopia risk, the hereditary component cannot be ignored. Specific genetic variations affecting eye growth, development, and refraction have been identified that predispose people to nearsightedness. These genes often relate to connective tissues, neurotransmitters, and intracellular signaling. However, experts note there are likely numerous genes involved in determining myopia susceptibility and that environmental factors do play a role. Overall, studies show parents who are nearsighted have a greater chance of passing myopia on to their children. The odds also increase if both parents are nearsighted. The precise risk depends on the severity of parental myopia as well as environmental exposures. Ethnic patterns also demonstrate a genetic link. Asian countries, for example, have a much higher rate of myopia than European countries or the United States. While genetics play a key role, lifestyle and environmental factors fine tune how these predispositions manifest. But the bottom line is clear – nearsightedness has a powerful hereditary component overall. Myopia Progression in Children Since myopia most often develops and worsens during childhood, this is the period when genetic risk is most influential. Children with one or more myopic parents need close monitoring as their eyes continue to grow and develop refractive errors. Rapid myopia progression is especially common between ages 8 15. This is a critical time when interventions can help safeguard a child’s eyesight and offset inherited risks. Implementing myopia control techniques at younger ages appears to have the greatest impact on slowing progression long term. The complex interplay between hereditary susceptibility and environmental exposures determines if and when myopia manifests and progresses in children. However, identifying and addressing genetic predispositions early helps preserve vision potential. Warning Signs of Myopia Onset in Children For children with a family history of nearsightedness, be vigilant about the following signs that may indicate myopia onset: Squinting or eye rubbing Difficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading close work Headaches after visual tasks Sitting very close to the TV Tilting head or closing one eye Holding objects close to face Any appearance of nearsighted symptoms warrants a comprehensive eye exam to assess the child’s status. Long Term Impacts of High Myopia In addition to blurred distance vision, high degrees of nearsightedness increase vulnerability for several blinding eye diseases later in adulthood. These include: Retinal detachment and tears Open angle glaucoma Myopic maculopathy Advancing myopia also further elevates the risk of vision loss from these ocular conditions. Catching and controlling early myopia development can therefore help preserve long term eye health and function. By understanding the hereditary factors at play and monitoring children’s eyes proactively, the impacts of myopia on visual and ocular health can be reduced over a lifetime. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Compelling research confirms that nearsightedness (myopia) is influenced by genetic factors. And while they’re not the only factor, children with one or more myopic parents, especially at high degrees, need thorough eye exams starting at an early age to determine if they are developing refractive errors indicating myopia onset. Through early detection and consistent treatment, the progression of inherited myopia risks can be significantly slowed. While genetic predispositions cannot be changed, being proactive allows for preserving a child’s vision and safeguarding their eye health over time.

Blog Eyes What is Nearsightedness and How is it treated?What is Nearsightedness and How is it treated? October 26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is one of the most common vision conditions affecting approximately 30+% of people in the United States. In fact, it is estimated that 20 25 million children have Myopia in the United States alone. With nearsightedness, objects up close are seen clearly while distant objects appear blurry or out of focus. This results when the eye grows too long from front to back measured by the axial length of the eye. The elongation of the eyeball causes light rays to focus incorrectly on the retina resulting in blurry distance vision. While nearsightedness cannot be cured, there are various options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia (nearsightedness). What Causes Nearsightedness? Nearsightedness occurs when the eyeball grows longer than normal from front to back. This causes the light entering the eye to focus in front of the retina rather than directly on it. This results in blurred distance vision, while near vision remains unaffected. Several factors contribute to the risk of developing nearsightedness, such as: Genetics – Research shows nearsightedness has a hereditary component. Children are more likely to be nearsighted if one or both parents have the condition vs. none. Frequent near work – Activities requiring prolonged close vision like reading and screen use may encourage eyesight to adapt towards nearsightedness over time. Excessive screen time – Increased use of computers, smartphones, tablets, and other screens is linked to rising myopia rates, especially in childhood. Reduced Outdoor time – Some studies indicate lack of outdoor exposure, natural sunlight, and vitamin D are associated with a greater incidence of nearsightedness. Urbanization – Populations living in urban versus rural areas tend to have higher rates of myopia on average. Ethnicity – Individuals of Asian descent have a higher prevalence of nearsightedness. Many Asian countries see nearsightedness (myopia) rates of over 80%. Signs and Symptoms The primary symptom of nearsightedness is blurred distance vision. When looking at distant objects like road signs, movies, whiteboards, or presentations, it can be difficult to see when nearsighted. This forces the eyes to strain and overwork to bring images into focus. As a result, individuals with uncorrected nearsightedness may experience: Difficulty seeing school classroom boards Squinting or leaning forward to see distant details such as the score of a game Headaches from excessive eye effort Eye fatigue after close work Poor night vision or problems driving at night Typically, both eyes are affected, though not always to the same degree. The blurry distance vision worsens gradually over time in most cases. Impacts of Uncorrected Nearsightedness Allowing nearsightedness (myopia) to remain untreated can lead to several problems for your child. Myopia usually progresses over time, resulting in greater blur and dependence on treatment or correction as you age. Constant squinting and eye effort add to fatigue and discomfort, and unclear vision makes reading and seeing whiteboards at school difficult. There is also evidence that myopia can have social implications, such as extracurricular activities that require distance vision become challenging. Not to mention many career options that have vision requirements. However, all these issues don’t compare to the increased risk of severe eye conditions like Glaucoma, cataracts, and the potential for retinal detachments. The severity of nearsightedness (myopia) typically stabilizes by adulthood. However, getting your child’s vision treated early provides significant benefits for eye health, visual development, and quality of life. Treatment Options for Nearsightedness While nearsightedness itself cannot be reversed or cured, there are effective treatment options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. The best option will depend on the severity of nearsightedness, lifestyle needs, age, and overall eye health of your child – all of which are taken into account when getting treatment with a Treehouse Eyes provider. Overnight Contact Lenses – Specially designed contact lenses are designed to be worn at night only, put in right before bed, and taken out in the morning. Called KIDS lenses, these custom contact lenses gently and comfortably reshape the front surface of the eye during the night, with an effect that lasts all day. These lenses are customized for each child to fit their eye and are designed to help reduce the progression of myopia. Daytime Soft Contact Lenses – These customized contact lenses are designed to be placed on the eye in the morning and removed each night. They have a special optical design to reduce the progression of myopia while providing clear vision during the day. This treatment allows children to be free from glasses all day while providing excellent comfort and vision for all their activities. Prescription Eye Drops – Another treatment alternative is a prescription eye drop, formulated to a specific concentration known to reduce the progression of myopia. These drops are applied at night before bed, according to the schedule your Treehouse Eyes doctor recommends. The child wears glasses or contact lenses during the day. This treatment is excellent for families concerned if their child is ready for a contact lens treatment, and often used for younger children or those showing rapid progression. Keeping Nearsightedness (Myopia) Under Control Below are some helpful tips you can start using right now to help slow the progression of your child’s nearsightedness. Reduce near work and screen time for children and take frequent visual breaks Increase time outdoors and exposure to natural sunlight Ensure proper use and wear of prescribed vision correction Eat a diet rich in eye healthy nutrients like vitamins C and E Get yearly comprehensive eye exams to establish a baseline and monitor for changes The Importance of Eye Exams Nearsightedness develops gradually over time but can accelerate quickly if not monitored. Routine eye exams allow early detection and treatment. Annual comprehensive exams are recommended for: Children and teens showing signs of vision issues Individuals with a family history of high myopia Those with existing myopia require close monitoring Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child.

Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors lead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all over the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day, whether reading a book, or using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or another device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially in excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and progression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration of near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating novel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a magazine a few minutes at a time. Genetics A child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or your spouse are myopic. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! What Can You Do? The good news is there are many things you can do you help slow or stop the progression of myopia. Get Regular (annual or semi annual) Eye Exams Even if both parents aren’t myopic, it’s still recommended to get an annual eye exam for your child. You can schedule a myopia consultation with a Treehouse Eyes provider near you. Many pediatricians are able to complete basic eye exams – be sure to ask them to check for myopia! Encourage Breaks from Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day. Encouraging breaks from near work such as reading and electronic devices will help your child’s eyes and give them a chance to get back outside as it warms up. Spend More Time in Natural Sunlight As you encourage your child to take a break from near work, one of the best ways to enjoy that newfound time is to get outside! Natural sunlight, even in the classroom, can be protective of myopia. Be sure to wear some sunblock as well! If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood.

Both organizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life. What is Myopia? Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, resulting in blurry distance vision and increased risks of serious, sight threatening eye diseases, such as glaucoma1, cataract2, or retinal eye diseases3. An estimated 1 in 3 children in the U.S. have myopia and the prevalence has grown dramatically over the last 30 years4. Research has shown lack of outdoor time for kids and more near work, like reading and time on screens, drive the massive increase we are seeing in myopia5 7. Myopia Progresses As Your Child Grows Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. Natural Sunlight Can Help Myopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050. In fact, a recent study found that increased exposure to outdoor light reduces myopia development. There Are Now Treatments for Myopia There is hope for parents is there are several treatments now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good candidate for treatment.

Myopia is an eye disease that occurs when the eye grows too long like the shape of a football. This causes distant objects to appear blurry and increases the risk of serious, sight threatening eye diseases in adulthood. As a parent, you want what’s best for your child. By learning these 5 important facts, you may feel encouraged to do more for your child’s eye health and long term vision such as ensuring that they get their eyes checked on a regular basis and turning to myopia management to prevent the rapid progression of this disease. The COVID 19 Pandemic Has Increased Myopia Prevalence In Children The significant reduction in outdoor time during the pandemic combined with the surge in screen time has increased the incidence of myopia cases. According to a systematic review and meta analysis published in Ophthalmic Research (2020), outdoor time helps slow down the change of axial length and reduce the risk of myopia. Similar results were found in a previous study in Ophthalmology (2013) that investigated the association between myopia in children and adolescents, and the amount of time spent outdoors. The study analyzed over 10,000 children and adolescents aged 20 and under and concluded a substantial correlation between increased time spent outside and the prevalence of myopia. Each additional hour spent outside per week was linked to a 2% reduction in the risk of myopia. Myopia Increases the Risk of Eye Disease Those with high myopia and rapidly progressing myopia in childhood are more prone to developing ocular comorbidities or serious sight threatening eye diseases later in life, such as: GlaucomaMacular degenerationMyopic MaculopathyRetinal detachment Myopia is a Progressive Eye Disease Myopia usually starts in childhood and progresses throughout a child’s school years, eventually stabilizing around ages 18 22. Since the eye grows in sync with the rest of the body, it’s only natural that it ceases elongating in early adulthood when the rest of the body stops growing. This also means that a child’s growth spurts often coincide with a higher prescription. Fortunately, myopia can be efficiently treated in order to prevent it from worsening as the child grows. Slowing myopia early in life can make a significant difference in your child’s eye health in their present and future. Myopia Is An Epidemic Myopia is a global epidemic that continues to worsen, affecting close to 2 billion individuals worldwide. If current trends hold, roughly half of the world’s population will be myopic by the year 2050, partly due to genetics and increasingly as a result of our society’s preference for staying indoors and spending more time on digital screens. Myopia Can Be Treated Myopia cannot be cured; however, its progression can be slowed or even halted. The goal of myopia treatment, also known as myopia management or myopia control, is to reduce or halt the eye’s rapid growth. Effective myopia treatment entails more than simply correcting a child’s blurry vision with glasses; it’s meant to prevent a child’s vision from deteriorating and, thus lowering their risk of developing severe myopia related eye diseases later in life.

It alters the shape and structure of the eye limiting its capability to focus on objects in the distance (blurry distance vision). If you have struggled with the condition before, your kids might also develop the disorder at some point in life. Myopia starts with signs small signs such as squinting, sitting too close to the TV, tablet, or book, and sometimes even manifests as headaches. Besides pain and discomfort, the onset of myopia can have a ruinous impact on the quality of your kid’s life. It can be hard to read the board at school or perform well in extracurricular activities. Therefore, it is imperative to diagnose and prevent myopia from worsening to more sight threatening conditions. We have hand picked practical ways you can utilize in curbing the progression of myopia in children. Let Them Spend Time Outdoors The bright and ambient light outdoors is linked to the modulation of correct eye development. Spending time outdoors can help reprogram the eye structure to focus on distant objects. You should encourage your kid to spend more time outdoors especially if he or she has already been diagnosed with myopia. Quality outdoor time helps to preserve good eyesight in addition to delaying the onset or progression of nearsightedness. Ideally, children need a minimum of 90+ minutes of quality time outdoors every day. Regular Eye Checks are Crucial Myopia is a very treatable condition, particularly when detected early. That is why it is crucial to take your kid for an eye test at least once a year. The disorder might show very few signs in its early stages, which is why establishing baseline measurements early is paramount. Additionally, some of its signs like headache and blurry vision can easily be confused for other conditions. When left untreated, myopia will gradually progress increasing the likelihood of contracting other vision disorders like cataracts or detached retinas. The only reliable manner to know if your kid is at risk of nearsightedness is through a clinical eye test measuring the axial length of the eye. If your eye doctor is not conducting this test, they are not providing you with the best measure of your child’s eye health. Limit Screen Time Excessive screen time and continuous near work are the greatest non genetic risk factors for nearsightedness. Activities such as computer use, drawing, and reading can cause a substantial amount of strain on the eye. If your children cannot avoid these activities entirely, it is advisable to limit the time they spend on them. Taking regular breaks helps the eye to relax and is ideal for managing the nearsightedness condition. Try Soft multifocal Lenses for Myopia Control We are still a few months or even years away from an FDA approved eyeglass for treating myopia. By wearing our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses, your child no longer has to depend on glasses to have clear vision during the daytime. We understand that at times, glasses can be an inconvenience for activities like sports and other vigorous activities. As such, our contact lenses not only allow your child to see clearly but also be free from the hassle of wearing glasses. In addition, our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses, like all our other products, are FDA approved, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Our doctors would also follow up in subsequent consultations to ensure that your child is doing well and that our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses are comfortable for their eyes. Go for Atropine Eye Drops Atropine eye drops can help keep the progression of nearsightedness in check by curbing eyeball elongation. The chemical agent also strengthens eyeball structures to prevent unwarranted eye growth that might occur in adolescent years to trigger myopia. Atropine eye drops are safe when used in proper amounts. You should always follow the eye doctor’s prescription when administering the chemical for effective myopia modulation. Overnight Lenses Might Help Treehouse Eyes’ Overnight Contact Lenses are specially designed to be worn only in the evening as your child goes to bed. As such, our Overnight Contact Lenses should be worn during sleep and taken out in the morning before your child prepares for the day. Specifically called KIDS Lenses, these lenses are custom made for each child to gently and comfortably reshape the cornea, which is the clear front surface of the eye. It’s incredibly important to ensure that our Overnight Contact Lenses are tailored to each child as everyone’s eye shape is different. If the lenses do not fit a particular eye shape, the eyes may get infected by a corneal abrasion. As such, at Treehouse Eyes, each child will undergo a consultation to receive his or her very own lenses that are fitted to their unique eye shape. Studies have shown that myopia progression can be slowed dramatically and, in some cases, stopped through this treatment in children. Conclusion Although it is impossible to cure myopia, the condition can be treated with several clinical methods including the use of daytime soft lenses. A nearsightedness (or short sightedness) diagnosis does not mean it is over for your child. Instead, you should focus on managing the conditions with the right practices to contain its progression and slow or potentially stop the disease in its tracks.

Unfortunately, many people are unknowingly adopting habits that could be hurting their eyes. That’s why it’s a good idea to examine your everyday routine and daily habits to ensure you aren’t inadvertently doing something that could hurt your eyes. In this article, your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen Optometric highlights some common habits that are bad for your eyes. Bad Habit #1: Not giving your eyes a break. Smart phones, laptops, tablets,and other digital devices with LCD screens are a staple of almost everyone’s daily lives. While looking at digital screens cannot always be avoided, spare yourself from digital eye strain by resting your eyes after every 20 minutes of screen time. Bad Habit #2: Using contact lenses improperly. If you’ve undergone any type of lenses treatment such as neurolens therapy and need to wear special lenses, it’s critical that you follow your eye doctor’s instructions when it comes to handling and caring for your lenses. The same goes for standard contact lenses. Bad Habit #3: Rubbing your eyes. This habit might be a little harder to kick. It might feel gratifying to rub your eyes, but rubbing your eyes too vigorously can cause the blood vessels under your eyelids to break. Try a cold compress the next time your eyes feel irritated. Bad Habit #4: Not eating well. A well balanced diet is crucial to keeping your eyes healthy. Choose foods rich in vitamins C and E, as well as foods containing zinc and omega 3 fatty acids. You don’t have to cook elaborate meals just make sure you load up on citrus fruits, fish and leafy greens. Lumen Optometric cares about your eye health.

The degree of myopia varies and it happens to around 30% of children and teens. To remedy this, there are specific treatments called myopia control. But what exactly is myopia control? As your locally trusted scleral optometrist, we’re here to help you understand what you need to know about myopia control. What Is Myopia Control? “Myopia control” is the term to describe the methods used to prevent the progression of myopia. These measures are usually prescribed by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. They come in four primary treatments, namely: multifocal contact lenses, atropine eye drops, multifocal eyeglasses, and orthokeratology. These treatments are important because they can help reduce the risk of complications that lead to high myopia, such as cataracts, retinal detachment, glaucoma and even blindness. Multifocal Contact Lenses These lenses are designed to provide clear vision for people who have nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and other refractive errors. These are also designed for people who are experiencing the normal age related loss of near focusing ability called presbyopia. Atropine Eye Drops This is a kind of dry eye treatment that’s commonly used to reduce the pain associated with eye inflammation. It also gives relief from focusing fatigue by dilating the pupil to limit the eye’s ability to automatically change focus. Also called accommodation, the effect it has by atropine eye drops can be counted for its effectiveness in reducing myopia progression in children. Multifocal Eyeglasses The eyeglasses work similarly to multifocal contact lenses, which help wearers with presbyopia see clearly. This control treatment can also mildly slow the progression of myopia in children. But some studies show that the progression slowed up to 51 percent in children compared to wearing normal glasses for correction. Orthokeratology Orthokeratology, or Ortho K, are specially designed gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight while sleeping to help reshape the eye’s cornea. This slows down the progression of myopia as well as provides clearer vision during the daytime without the need for lenses or glasses. Some studies found that children wearing ortho k contact lenses reduced the lengthening of the eyeball by almost 43 percent compared to wearing regular eyeglasses for myopia correction.

Blog Information Can Myopia Be Prevented?Can Myopia Be Prevented? December 6, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Parents who are nearsighted often wonder what can be done to prevent their children from developing the same or similar conditions. While scientists haven’t yet found a way to guarantee that your child won’t develop myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), there are things you can do to delay its onset and even prevent its progression. What is Myopia? Myopia is a progressive eye disease that causes the eye to grow longer than normal, altering its ability to correctly focus light onto the retina. This results in blurred distance vision that can make it difficult for children to learn efficiently in the classroom or take part in extracurricular activities. Myopia is often corrected with prescription glasses or contact lenses, but these methods simply correct the child’s vision while allowing the condition to worsen. Why is it Important to Delay or Slow Myopia Progression? The worse your child’s myopia gets, the higher their chance of developing sight threatening diseases like glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment later in life. That’s why it’s important to try and keep your child’s lens prescription low and controlled using the methods listed below. If your child doesn’t yet have myopia, following the same protocol will help prevent myopia onset for as long as possible. Is it Possible To Prevent Myopia or Myopia Progression? While many children inherit myopia from their parents, there are also several environmental factors that can lead to the onset and progression of nearsightedness. By making some lifestyle changes, it may be possible to delay the onset of myopia and prevent its progression. Boost Daily Outdoor Time Research shows that children of myopic parents who spend a lot of time outdoors have lower rates of myopia than children who stay mostly indoors. A recent study published in Review of Optometry (2021) concluded that children should spend at least 2 3 hours per day engaged in outdoor activities to delay the onset of myopia, especially if a child has one myopic parent. Another study published in Ophthalmic Research (2020) confirms the protective effect of “sun time” against myopia onset. When observing the myopia rates of 6 12 year olds, there were fewer new myopia cases in the group of children who spent between 11 15 hours outdoors per week, compared with children who didn’t. The researchers also found that the myopia progression rate was slower in the group of children who spent more time in the daylight. If you do add some extra outdoor time to your child’s daily routine, be sure to provide them with UV blocking sunglasses, sunscreen, a water bottle and other sun safe gear. Limit Screen Time Screen time is thought to have a greater impact on a child’s vision than other near work like reading a book, for a few reasons. Children are exposed to digital screens at a younger age than other forms of near work, and they tend to use screens for longer intervals of time. Additionally, the working distance between a child’s eyes and a digital screen tends to be shorter than the distance between their eyes and a book or other object, to compensate for the small print size and images. An article published in Review of (2021) examines the results of several scientific studies that analyze the relationship between screen time and myopia. Two of these studies found that the risk of developing myopia was 8 times greater for children aged 5 15 who used a smartphone or video game for more than 2 hours a day, compared to children who have 0 2 hours of daily screen time. And while we don’t expect parents to ban all digital devices from their homes, it is advisable to set daily limits on digital device usage. Try to cap your child’s daily screen time at 2 hours. Children under the age of 2 should have as little screen time as possible. Encourage Frequent Breaks From Near Work Any sort of near work, like reading and writing, puts a strain on your child’s eyes and can contribute to myopia onset and progression. One way to prevent myopia development in your child is to teach them to take breaks from visually demanding activities. A 2008 study published in the journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science found that the intensity of near work plays an important role in myopia development in schoolchildren. According to the study, the duration of uninterrupted near work seems to be more significant than the overall time spent engaged in close distance activities. Regular Myopia Eye Exams Whether or not your young child or teen has myopia, yearly eye exams with your optometrist are crucial to keeping their vision healthy and clear. It’s important to note that vision screenings in school are not enough to detect most visual problems, and certainly not for preventing myopia. Tracking your child’s eyesight yearly will help determine the best treatment for preventing myopia onset and slowing or halting its progression.

While instances and awareness of myopia are on the rise, to help spread myopia awareness we’ve written out the basics on childhood myopia, why it matters, and what you as a parent can do to help preserve your child’s eye health in the long run. What is Myopia? Myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness) is the most common cause of impaired vision in people under age 40, and its prevalence in children is growing at an alarming rate. Myopia typically starts in childhood and progresses (the eye keeps getting bigger), or gets worse, until early adulthood. During this time the symptom of myopia, blurry distance vision, gets worse, meaning the patient needs stronger glasses to continue to see clearly. If blurry distance vision is the symptom of myopia, what exactly is myopia? Stated again, myopia is an eye that is growing too long. How do we know this? We measure it using special non invasive technology to calculate the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length and is measured down to fractions of a millimeter with advanced equipment. So, myopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye. Risk Factors for Myopia Myopia risk factors include genetics (having one or both parents myopic), an insufficient amount of time spent outdoors, and excessive near work (time spent reading, school work, & digital screens). Childhood myopia is progressive, which is why your child may need a new prescription every year or two. Unless treated, a child’s myopia will continue to worsen until early adulthood. What some people don’t realize is that myopia is far more than simply blurred vision it’s associated with drastically higher risk of developing eye disease in the future. How Can Myopia Impact a Child’s Health? Childhood myopia places a child at a greater risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life, as compared to non myopic children, and the odds only increase as myopia continues to progress. In fact, a child with myopia is 2 to 40 times more likely to develop myopic maculopathy (also known as myopic macular degeneration, a serious vision threatening complication) depending on their degree of nearsightedness. Retinal detachment is another serious eye condition that can cause permanent blindness. A myopic child is 3 to 21 times more likely to develop this emergency eye condition in adulthood. Moreover, children with myopia have a threefold risk of developing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, in the long run. And although cataracts are considered a normal part of aging, having myopia advances the age at which they develop. According to a study published in JAMA Ophthalmology, individuals with high myopia are more likely to need cataract surgery at an earlier age than those with no myopia. Furthermore, aside from an increased risk of adult eye disease, untreated myopia can prevent a child from succeeding academically and socially. A 2019 study published in the Community Eye Health Journal underscores the importance of excellent visual acuity in school aged children. It found that offering vision correction to students with myopia has more of an educational impact than providing them with vitamins or medications to maintain or improve their physical health. Myopia has equally serious ramifications outside the classroom. A study published in BMC Ophthalmology (2016) found that adolescents with myopia are more likely to have anxiety than their peers with normal vision. Furthermore, adverse visual symptoms impact a child’s self esteem, according to a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science. The good news is that certain lifestyle choices, especially when coupled with myopia management treatment, can have a lasting positive effect on your child’s eye health. What Can Parents Do To Help Slow Myopia Progression? We know that parents want what’s best for their children. So here are a few recommendations that will help keep your child’s eyes healthy whether or not myopia has set in. Take your kids outside to play. Several studies have indicated that children who spend over 2 hours outdoors during the day have lower levels of myopia and slower myopia progression. A recent study published in BMC Ophthalmology and cited in Review of Optometry (2021) found that for non myopic children with myopic parents, “a high level of outdoor exposure had a remarkable influence on the risk of new myopia for children even with one myopic parent.” Although it’s not always easy, try to limit the amount of continuous near work your child does. Whether it’s reading or scrolling through a phone, remind your child to take breaks. However, the most important thing you can do to protect your child’s long term eye health is manage their myopia with treatment. We Can Help Preserve Your Child’s Eye Health At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to provide expert care to each and every child with kindness and a smile.

Clear sight is vital for kids to thrive in school, sports, play, and daily life. However, many children have undiagnosed vision issues that require early detection and intervention for the best outcomes. Why Early Detection Matters Catching vision problems early in childhood is crucial. Early detection ensures children get the vision correction they need during critical developmental windows. Those children suffering from vision deficits can lead to academic issues, behavioral problems, and even low self esteem issues. Signs Your Child May Need an Eye Exam There are several signs parents should look for that may indicate a child is struggling with their vision: Frequent squinting or rubbing of the eyes Sitting very close to the TV or holding devices close to the face Tilting the head to one side Covering one eye Difficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading close work Losing place while reading Trouble differentiating colors Clumsiness or poor hand eye coordination Headaches or eye pain after visual tasks If you observe any of these symptoms, schedule an eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist who specializes in pediatric patients. An exam can identify issues like nearsightedness, farsightedness, lazy eye, convergence problems, and other disorders. Protecting Your Child’s Vision Health Along with regular eye exams, there are several ways parents can help maintain healthy eyesight: Ensure your child wears 100% UV blocking sunglasses outside Limit screen time and take frequent breaks from ‘near work’ Provide a nutritious diet with eye healthy vitamins Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure Following your eye doctor’s specialized treatment plan is also essential to managing any vision conditions your child is diagnosed with. The Benefits of Annual Eye Exams Getting your child’s eyes checked every year is a critical piece of preventive healthcare. At annual exams, optometrists and ophthalmologists thoroughly evaluate vision acuity, eye alignment, and eye health. Treehouse Eyes optometrists go a step further by measuring axial length to determine if myopia is present or not. This allows early detection of refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness) as well as other eye disorders like amblyopia or strabismus, which require prompt treatment. Catching and addressing issues early improves outcomes and treats the issues rather than just correcting them with glasses. Annual exams also screen for eye diseases and conditions that rarely show apparent symptoms in kids, like glaucoma. Preventing and controlling these disorders protects long term vision. Treehouse Eyes is proud to join in Children’s Eye Health and Safety Month by helping educate families about protecting one of their child’s most precious gifts the ability to see the world clearly. By scheduling comprehensive eye exams each year and remaining vigilant for signs of vision issues, parents can ensure their child’s visual development stays on track. If you have any concerns about your child’s vision, consult a Treehouse Eyes doctor near you. Healthy eyes and clear sight in childhood provide a lifetime of benefits.

Blog Information Do Your Eyes Grow?Do Your Eyes Grow? August 28, 2023 by Lumen Optometric The Complex Relationship Between Eye Growth and Myopia Development The human eye is a remarkably dynamic organ that undergoes natural growth and changes over a lifetime. One key factor that significantly impacts eye development is myopia, also known as nearsightedness. Myopia occurs when the eyeball elongates (grows too long) from front to back, causing light rays to focus incorrectly and distant objects to appear blurry. This eye growth is driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Research shows myopia is becoming more prevalent globally, affecting around 30% of the world’s population, with an estimated 50% by the year 2050. Theories for this increase include frequent near work on digital devices homework and less time outdoors early in life. Both can strain the visual system and put the eyes at risk for abnormal elongation. When myopia develops, the implications go beyond the need for vision correction. Excessive eye growth is linked to a higher risk of blinding conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment later in life. Myopia also reduces the quality of life, at school, when playing sports, participating in extracurriculars, and activities requiring distance vision like driving. So what proactive steps can be taken to support healthy eye development and reduce the odds of myopia onset? The most important step you can take is to get your child a yearly eye exam. This ensures that their vision is being monitored and tracked in case of issues like myopia. Below are a few other tips to help support your child’s eye health. Increase time outdoors, especially in early childhood. Avoid chronic use of screens mobile devices at young ages Maintain clear focus on distant objects through activities like sports Get regular eye exams to monitor for signs of abnormal growth Eat a nutritious diet and nutrients that may support ocular health Understand your genetic predispositions and family history The key is taking preventive actions early. Though myopia itself cannot be reversed once manifested, slowing or even stopping the progression is possible. Implementing healthy lifestyle habits and frequent eye assessments allows for early intervention against excessive eye growth in children. So do your eyes grow? Yes. Just like all other parts of the body, your eyes grow as well. Where issues occur is when the eyeball grows too long from front to back (a.k.a. Myopia), resulting in blurred distance vision.

Recently, doctors in our Treehouse Eyes community had the chance to spread the word about myopia with local media coverage. Our doctors are passionate about spreading awareness about the myopia epidemic and how early intervention can mean a lot for your child’s eye health. Explore some of the topics our peers covered in recent interviews. How To Tell If Your Child Is Nearsighted It’s not always simple to detect whether or not your child is nearsighted. Watching out for the common symptoms of myopia is key to determine whether or not your child needs treatment. Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Aimee Jacobs OD, discusses some signs to look out for. Dr. Jacobs explains, “If they’re having trouble focusing in school, if they can’t stay on task, if it seems like it might be a behavior issue, a lot of times it’s because they can’t see what they’re doing or they can’t see what they’re doing well enough to focus on it.” Screen Time As a Risk Factor As screen time increases, so does the early onset of myopia. Treehouse Eyes has observed a 30 percent increase in the number of myopic children being treated since the pandemic began. Dr. Tiffany Martinez recalls the effects of the pandemic on children, “During the pandemic we saw a lot more kids they we saw become myopic than we did before.” This is due to the decreased time outdoors and increase in near work. Another Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Ryan Stybel describes the effects of too much ‘near work’, “Screen time or near work is causing myopia to start at an earlier age but also progress more rapidly.” He then goes on to explain the implications of COVID isolation, “We’re just getting through a pandemic, myopia is an epidemic especially with the increased screen time and virtual learning. Limiting screen time is a very important thing and taking frequent breaks and spending time outdoors. We recommend 90 minutes a day outdoors to use the natural sunlight and looking at distance objects can be beneficial and help their eyes from getting worse.” What To Look For As a Parent: Myopia is a treatable and preventable disease, annual eye exams are highly recommended because often times children are unable to articulate their symptoms to a parent. Dr. Denise Smith, a Treehouse Eyes doctor featured on KVUE TV in Austin, Texas provides some tips on how to detect myopia, “Parents can be looking for if the child is squinting, if they can’t see the board at school they might be complaining of headaches, or holding books closer to their face holding their phone closer, maybe getting closer to the television.” So why is it essential to go through myopia management and treatment rather than just getting glasses? Dr. Smith explains why myopia treatment is critical, “If the child is diagnosed with myopia, just getting glasses can help them see clearly, but will not do anything to stop the progression or prevent the eyeball from getting longer. So you want to be able to have those specialized treatments to actually stop that process which in turn can prevent sight threatening disorders later on.” Let Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia Treating myopia early is crucial to prevent children’s vision from getting worse. Our mission is to give children better vision for life so children can have a life advantage to being able to participate in more activities.

Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a common vision problem that will affect half the world’s population by 2050. It occurs when the eye is unable to focus on distant objects without corrective lenses like glasses or contacts. Myopia is caused by a variety of factors, including genetic and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. Is Myopia Genetic? If you’re thinking about myopia, knowing if it’s genetic is essential. If you happen to be myopic, then your kids might be at risk of developing the same condition. Myopia has two types: genetic and non genetic (or “acquired”). Genetic myopia is passed down through families and tends to run in certain clusters or patterns. Non genetic means that individuals develop their vision issues without any family history or a genetic predisposition toward poor vision. In general, suppose both parents have healthy eyesight but have children with poor vision (without any other eye problems). It’s likely that those kids were born with a form of genetic myopia known as Axial Myopia (AM). About half of all cases fall into this category! Why Does Myopia Get Worse with Age? When you find out your child is first diagnosed with myopia, it is essential to intervene as early as possible. Myopia progresses when a child’s eye grows too long from front to back, causing permanent and irreversible eye growth, known as axial elongation (the measure of the eye from front to back). When a Treehouse Eyes doctor finds a low level of myopia (nearsightedness), it’s easier to treat with a wider range of treatment options. In short, myopia changes as we age due to axial length elongation that occurs during childhood. The longer the eyeball gets, it’s associated with serious eye conditions that can lead to permanent vision loss such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts. This is why it is imperative to treat myopia as early as possible and start getting your child’s eye examined annually to catch any changes in their vision. How to Stop Myopia from Getting Worse with Age To prevent myopia from getting worse with age, it’s important to get your child regular eye exams and see the treatment options for myopia such as custom contact lenses or prescription eye drops. If you’re concerned about your eyesight, it’s always a good idea to schedule an appointment with a Treehouse Eyes optometrist. Conclusion Myopia is a common vision problem that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by a variety of factors, including genetics and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. The key to properly treating myopia and preventing it from worsening is by catching it early, typically in childhood. By following the tips mentioned above, you can help prevent myopia from getting worse and maintain good eye health.

There is some debate about whether myopia is a disease or a refractive error. The answer is uncovered by how myopia is defined and measured. What Is The Definition Of A Disease? The Review of provides a few definitions of disease to consider: A disease is any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional state of an organism, generally associated with certain signs and symptoms and differing in nature from physical injury. (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020) A disease is an abnormal condition affecting a living organism. Diseases are generally understood to be medical conditions that involve a pathological process associated with a specific set of symptoms. (Infectious Disease News, 2019) Myopia, also called nearsightedness or shortsightness, is the inability to see objects at a distance and is the most common vision issue amongst children and adults. Myopia’s main symptom is blurry distance vision; however, the physiological implications of myopia is that the eyeball itself grows too long from front to back, see figure 1 below. Is Myopia Curable? The question of whether or not myopia is curable helps illustrate why myopia is a disease. Treehouse Eyes doctor, Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. addresses the common question, “Can myopia be cured?” Myopia is not curable, but it can be treated. “Unfortunately, once myopia happens, which happens due to the eyeball growing too long, it is impossible to shrink it afterwards. When myopia occurs, it is permanent and irreversible.” Dr. Mai then goes on to explain the importance of early intervention, “We can prevent high levels of myopia which are associated with diseases such as macular maculopathy and retinal detachment. Starting treatment early is critical because there is no cure for myopia and once a child is diagnosed with this disease, it typically gets worse if left untreated.” Myopia is a disease that can be treated at the source by providing children with treatment options, rather than just giving a child glasses for the symptom of myopia which is blurry vision. Myopia Is a Disease Although myopia has symptoms like blurry vision, that aren’t caused by physical injury, myopia itself is caused by the eye growing too long. In other words, the axial length increases outside of the normal rate for a child’s age. See Figure 2 below. Image Source The elongation of the eye is the core issue. Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. details, “The greater the myopia, the longer the axial length of the eye and thus greater risk. Myopia is clearly a disease. One that requires treatment to reduce the negative impact it can have on a person’s eye health and vision.” Myopia is a significant, prevalent disease in children with increasing rates of progression. There are also two types of classifications: non pathologic and pathologic myopia. How is Myopia Treated?

In fact, the treatment is one of the most common methods of vision correction in pre teens and teens. 2\\\\. “Who is considered a good candidate?” Ortho K proves to be an effective treatment for farsighted, nearsighted and astigmatic patients. If your child has been unable to wear contact lenses, due to discomfort or allergies, they make a good candidate. This is because Ortho K lenses are easy to use and can be worn while sleeping. 3\\\\. “How do Ortho K lenses differ from typical lenses?” Ortho K contact lenses are specifically designed with highly oxygen permeable material. The back surface of the lens is particularly made to enable the reshaping of the corneal tissue. 4\\\\. “How long does it take to reach good vision?” Stable vision can be achieved after 10 14 days of treatment, depending on the prescription. In fact, 50 70% of the desired visual correction is attained after the first night of wear. 5\\\\. “How long can Ortho K provide myopia control?” The effect of myopia control should last as long as your use of Ortho K lenses. It is advisable for young children to wear the lenses until their late teens when myopia tends to destabilize. Fortunately, there are no anecdotal reports from patients that state ‘rebounding’ after their use of ortho K contact lenses has come to an end. To get started with Ortho K treatment, it is essential to contact a trusted eye exam doctor. Here at Lumen Optometric, we strive to provide excellent full service eye care solutions with outstanding patient care services to match.

This is especially true with the pandemic upheaving our lives and forcing us to stay home for virtual learning or work from home. The consequences are not just limited to heightened obesity rates. Studies have shown that having less sunlight could actually change the ways that a child’s eyes develop, resulting in a myopia epidemic that rises in tandem with the obesity crisis. You need to encourage your child to spend more time outdoors to protect their eyesight and prevent myopia. Downsides of Spending Time Indoors According to a recent Australian study, kids who spend only about 20 minutes per day outdoors experience quicker growth in the length of their eyes than those who log more hours in bright eyes. This can result in myopia and trouble seeing faraway objects. Thankfully, there are some ways available that you can still use to keep an eye on your child’s eyesight. They are listed as follows. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Encourage Outdoor Time Our eyes need an optimal amount of bright light that can be gotten from outdoors. Therefore, by aiming for around 40 minutes of outdoor time daily, not only can your children get the physical activity that they need that day, but it can also be beneficial to their eyes and help to prevent the onset of myopia. Look out for Warning Signs It is important to look out for warning signs that your child might have myopia so that they can get treated for it early. Children suffering from myopia may squint, constantly feel the need to rub their eyes or complain of consistent headaches, they may also start having trouble with their academic grades. If your child experiences any of these symptoms, it is important to schedule an appointment with an optometrist. Schedule Regular Screenings To help prevent or manage myopia, it is important to have regular eye screenings for your child. Doctors recommend yearly vision screenings either by your child’s pediatrician or their school as well as a vision screen at well child visits through age 4. Newborn babies should also have their vision tested before they leave the hospital, and before your child hits the age of 5, it is important to take them to a pediatric ophthalmologist for a thorough checkup if they are suffering from any vision concerns or have a family history of vision concerns. If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease.

But how much do you really know about this progressive eye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll explore 4 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about your child’s eye health and long term vision. Myopia is an Eye Disease Myopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. As this happens, the symptoms of the disease are blurry distance vision. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. To help combat this, we recommend eye exams every six months to track myopia progress. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye disease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people worldwide. We are currently on pace to have half of the world’s population with some degree of myopia by the year 2050! Indoor time, excessive ‘near work’, and genetic factors all play a role in the growth of myopia. Education For Their Future Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development when they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease Myopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight threatening eye diseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50% higher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop cataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults than children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of clear vision a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided their children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic maculopathy fell by 40%.

Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. It can affect both children and adults, with over 50% of American teenagers being myopic according to this journal. Here are some ways to recognize the signs and symptoms of myopia in children. Consistent Headaches Headaches can be a common system of vision problems, it is important to track how often your child is experiencing symptoms of headaches. Some headaches may be a result of allergy symptoms or pressure changes, but they could also be a direct result of nearsightedness. If your child is experiencing more than one headache per week, do schedule an appointment with an optometrist or pediatrician to try and get your vision checked for myopia. Excessive Eye Watering Excessive eye watering can also be a symptom of myopia, given that it can result in discomfort in the eyes. If your child experiences consistent and excessive eye watering, do schedule an appointment with an optometrist to get your vision checked. Excessive Squinting If your child is squinting excessively, it might also be a symptom of myopia. This is due to the fact that humans suffering from myopia squint as a result in changes in the tension of their eye muscles, providing them with brief clarity of vision. Thereby, it should be easy to spot individual suffering from nearsightedness if he or she engages in excessive squinting. Holding Objects Close to Their Face Another glaring symptom to look for if wondering is if your child constantly holds objects closer to their face to see them properly. This is a clear symptom of nearsightedness which may be caused by excessive usage of screen time. Consistent Rubbing Of Eyes When dealing with a young child that might potentially have myopia, they might often rub their eyes as a sign of discomfort. If you notice that your child excessively and consistently rubs their eyes, it might be a sign to schedule a consultation with the optometrist to have their vision assessed. Sitting Very Close to the TV You might find your child sitting too close to the TV than they normally do. The most apparent sign that your child may have myopia, especially for older kids, is if they grumble about the images on the TV screen looking unclear or blurry, or if they tell you they have issues reading the words shown on screens.

This is unfortunate as your eye health and visual acuity have a major impact on your overall well being and quality of life. . In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric shares some simple eye health tips for young adults. Take a Break When Using Digital Devices Young adults tend to spend a lot of time on their digital devices. Unfortunately, staring at a computer or phone screen for too long can make the eyes feel dry and tired, eventually causing blurred vision. This is because people tend to blink less when staring at a digital screen. To avoid digital eye strain, you need to give your eyes frequent breaks. You can do this by following the 20 20 20 rule: after 20 minutes of screen time, look at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds to give your eyes a break. Practice Good Contact Lens Hygiene If you wear contact lenses, it’s critical to observe proper hygiene to avoid eye infections. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses and keep water away from your contacts. Use fresh contact lens disinfecting solution every time. Always wash your hands with soap and water and then dry them with a clean cloth before touching your contact lenses. Most importantly, follow your eye doctor’s recommendations about replacing your contact lenses. Don’t wear a pair of contact lenses beyond their scheduled replacement date. Lead a Healthy Lifestyle The three most important things you can do to safeguard your vision are maintaining a healthy diet, exercising often and avoiding smoking. Leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing eye diseases like age related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and diabetic retinopathy. You should also practice good sleeping habits. Lack of sleep can adversely affect your health in many ways. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of eye care services including orthokeratology therapy, neurolens therapy and more.

In our technologically driven world, conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism are becoming increasingly prevalent among children. This article will unpack these conditions, helping you understand what they are, how they differ, and most importantly, what you can do to manage and treat them. The Differences Between Myopia and Astigmatism Myopia results when your eye grows too long from front to back, causing light to focus before it reaches the retina. If a normal eye is shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye may more closely resemble a football. In contrast, astigmatism is usually due to an irregularly shaped cornea or lens. Myopia primarily affects distance vision, while astigmatism affects vision at all distances. Both conditions can coexist in one eye, and they often do. This combination can further complicate vision, making it crucial to address both issues. Combining Science and a Child Centric Approach At Treehouse Eyes®, we combine robust, science backed data with inspiring aesthetics for both children and parents alike. We’ve created an environment that children love, helping to alleviate the fear sometimes associated with medical appointments. Our team of experts provides thorough eye examinations using the latest technology, identifying refractive errors and other eye health issues early. We then create a personalized treatment plan that suits the needs and lifestyle of your child. Myopia and astigmatism are common eye conditions that can affect children of all ages. If your child has been diagnosed with either of these conditions, it’s important to seek early treatment to protect their vision and prevent further complications. Managing Myopia and Astigmatism with Treehouse Eyes® So, how can you protect your child’s vision if they’re diagnosed with myopia or astigmatism? Treehouse Eyes® is the first and only dedicated myopia management service provider in the United States.

If this is the case, you may feel relieved about this, but does it really mean you have perfect vision? To answer this, we’ll first explain the related vision terminology to help you understand how we measure your vision’s quality. Visual Acuity Visual acuity is the term used to express the clarity or sharpness of your vision. This is measured by your ability to identify the letters or numbers on a standardized eye chart while standing at a certain distance. So, for instance, if you have 20 20 vision, you can see clearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance. Similarly, if you have 20 100 vision, it must mean that you can see as close as 20 feet to see what those with 20 20 vision normally see at 100 feet. 20 20 vision doesn’t always mean your eyesight is perfect. For instance, if you’re getting nearsighted, we may recommend that you use our orthokeratology lenses to slow its progression. But then this only indicates how sharp and clear your vision is at a distance. There are also other vision skills that are just as important, such as eye coordination, side vision, focusing ability, color vision, and depth perception. The Snellen visual acuity system is named after the Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, who developed the system in 1862. The system uses acuity measurements in fractions of 20 20, 20 40, 20 60, and so on. The numerator or the top number of the Snellen fraction is the distance between the eye chart and the patient. In the U.S., the viewing distance is usually 20 feet while in other countries, it’s 6 meters. Meanwhile, the bottom number of the fraction corresponds to the visual acuity of the patient. Higher numbers mean less clarity and sharpness in eyesight. For instance, the Big “E” that you see in most Snellen eye charts corresponds to 20 200 visual acuity. If this is the only letter you can discern, then there’s a chance that you may be legally blind unless prescribed with corrective contact lenses. The Factors and Limits The major factors that determine visual acuity are as follows: 1\\\\. The accuracy of how the lens and cornea of the eye focuses light onto the retina 2\\\\. The sensitivity of the nerves in the retina and vision centers in the brain 3\\\\. The ability of the brain to interpret information received from the eyes Visual acuity tests are quite useful in measuring the clarity of your eyesight in standardized conditions, it’s not completely accurate in determining the overall quality of your vision. Some of its limitations are that it can’t measure how well you see colored objects, moving objects, or objects that are similar in brightness to their background.

Blog Information What Is The Difference Between Myopia and Hyperopia?What Is The Difference Between Myopia and Hyperopia? June 15, 2023 by Morris Ilagan When it comes to common vision disorders, myopia and hyperopia are often confused. In the article, we’ll dive deep into these distinct vision impairments, understand their distinctive characteristics, and explore current treatment modalities. Understanding Myopia and Hyperopia Myopia, also referred to as nearsightedness, is a vision condition whose symptoms are blurry distance vision. This is a result of the eye growing too long from front to back leading to blurry vision when looking at faraway objects. On the other hand, hyperopia, or farsightedness, is the opposite. Distant objects are clear, but those up close appear blurry. This condition occurs when the eye is too short from front to back, or the cornea is too flat, leading to light focusing behind the retina. Diagnosis and Differences The diagnosis of both conditions involves scheduling a routine eye exam – especially one trained to spot myopia like the doctors at Treehouse Eyes. These exams include visual acuity tests, refraction assessments, and eye health evaluations. Be sure that your eyecare provider is measuring your child’s axial length to ensure an accurate diagnosis of myopia. Axial length will measure how long the eye is front to back. Notably, the critical difference between myopia and hyperopia lies in their distinct symptoms and the way they affect vision. People with myopia often have difficulty viewing road signs, and whiteboards, or watching a movie at a cinema or at home. In contrast, those with hyperopia may struggle with tasks like reading, using a smartphone, doing homework, and other times where closer vision is necessary. Treatment Modalities Fortunately, both myopia and hyperopia are manageable with several treatment options. The key for both, but especially myopia, is early detection and treatment. Myopia is a disease that typically develops in children (ages 6 – 12) and continues through puberty until the child stops growing. This can sometimes be well into adulthood (25 years old in some cases) which is why early treatment and prevention are key to slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. For children, orthokeratology, or Ortho K, is a potential treatment. It involves the use of specially designed gas permeable contact lenses that temporarily reshape the cornea to help treat your childs myopia. Recent studies suggest that certain types of multifocal contact lenses may slow the progression of myopia in children. Furthermore, low dose atropine eye drops have shown promising results in minimizing the advancement of myopia. Conclusion Understanding the differences between myopia and hyperopia is vital in recognizing the need for a timely eye exam and appropriate treatment. Through modern optometry, children are now able to receive the treatment and care they need to improve their vision and quality of life. Remember, regular eye examinations are critical to detect any visual impairments at an early stage.

Still, it can also bring a host of changes to your vision. As the hormones in your body change and fluctuate during this period, you may experience various eye related issues that can affect how clearly you see or make your eyes uncomfortable It’s good to be aware of these common changes and take steps to protect your vision throughout pregnancy. Common Vision Changes During Pregnancy Here’s what you can expect: Dry Eyes – Many women experience dry eyes during pregnancy due to hormonal fluctuations. It usually happens around mid pregnancy when hormone levels are at their highest point and decreases after delivery as hormone levels return to normal. Blurry Vision – During pregnancy, it is not uncommon for women’s eyesight to become blurry or cloudy due to their changing hormones. It should resolve itself once their hormone levels return to normal after childbirth. Light Sensitivity – Some pregnant women find themselves more sensitive than usual when exposed to bright lights, such as sunlight or fluorescent lighting in stores or office buildings, which can cause discomfort. Floaters – Small spots may appear in front of one’s field of vision, known as floaters. These tend to increase with age but may temporarily worsen during pregnancy because many people become dehydrated while expecting a baby. Glaucoma – Women with a family history of glaucoma are at higher risk for developing it during the later stages of their pregnancies, so regular checkups with an optometrist will help ensure that any potential problems are caught early on before causing further damage. Eye Health During Pregnancy Here are some tips for protecting vision during pregnancy: Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables high in vitamins A and C. Drink plenty of fluids, like water, every day. Wear sunglasses outdoors if needed. Get regular checkups from an optometrist throughout all trimesters. Rest often and get adequate sleep each night. Manage stress by taking breaks from work, exercising regularly, etc. Why You Should Get Checked If pregnant women fail to protect their vision, they risk serious complications such as premature birth, miscarriage and gestational diabetes. Regular optometrist visits are essential to catch any potential problems before they become more severe.

If you’d like to improve your vision with high quality contact lenses, our skilled eye care specialists can help. Complete Contact Lens Exams Lumen Optometric completes in depth contact exams.

Using the latest technology and training, we can measure your eye surface and eye moisture levels to determine the correct size, type and prescription to best fit your health and lifestyle needs. Benefits of Contact Lenses Clarity. Like glasses, contact lenses improve vision by using light and refraction. But while eyeglasses can obstruct your peripheral vision, contact lenses conform to your eyes to offer a wider field of view. Ease. Contact lenses don’t get in the way of an active lifestyle. Patients who exercise, play sports or like to be outside often feel less encumbered when wearing contact lenses. Versatility. Some patients prefer the way they look with contact lenses. Glasses can change the appearance of your face and may clash with certain outfits or colors, but contacts offer complete versatility. Improved eye health. Specialized contacts can even reshape your cornea while you sleep! Orthokeratology lenses slow the progression of nearsighted vision, and Lumen Optometric is the only eye doctor in Los Angeles County to fit custom, doctor designed lenses.

As the only neurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley, Lumen Optometric customizes state of the art lenses that bring clarity and comfort to patients suffering from migraines, neck strain, tired eyes and more. Our goal is to help your eyes and head feel less tortured at the end of the day, so if you suffer from any of the following symptoms, Lumen Optometric can help: > How Neurolens Therapy Works Your brain is constantly in communication with your two eyes, keeping them aligned and in sync to help you see the world without double vision. If your eyes are misaligned, however, your brain struggles to maintain balance. Without this balance, you could experience constant headaches, migraines, tension in and around your eyes, dizziness and even neck stiffness. Add misalignment to the strenuous demands that computer screens, phones and other digital devices place on your visual system, and you could face daily suffering. Fortunately, 10 years of research into headaches and their associated visual symptoms has yielded the revolutionary neurolens treatment. Neurolens therapy helps correct misalignment at the distance where you need the most help. Whether you struggle to see far away or up close, Lumen Optometric can provide customized neurolenses that correct your specific misalignment and give you the most comfortable vision possible. Lumen Optometric is proud to offer this exciting new technology and we’d love to help you discover relief for your symptoms! Check out the following video for a neurolens overview, and then read on for answers to some of the FAQs we receive. Neurolens FAQ What makes this any different than the glasses I wore in the past? The difference is in the technology and the visual experience. Neurolenses utilize patented, clinically tested technology to correct your misalignment at your prescribed working distance. There is no lens on the market that offers the same technology. And Lumen Optometric keeps several sets of neurolens prescriptions on hand, so if you are a candidate for a neurolens treatment, you’ll have the opportunity to see and feel the neurolens difference at the end of your exam! How do you measure my misalignment? Lumen Optometric utilizes a sophisticated instrument called the SightSync to measure your eye misalignment at varying distances. Coupled with specialized in office testing, your eye measurements allow us to create a lens that helps with your specific symptoms. How quickly can I expect my symptoms to improve? Most Lumen Optometric patients notice an improvement within the week, although patients with extremely chronic conditions may require six to eight weeks to notice an improvement. Are there any side effects to the neurolenses? First time neurolens wearers typically report feeling lighter, as if there’s less burden on their heads, necks, shoulders and eyes. But, as with any new type of lens, you may feel disoriented for about a week as your brain adapts. Schedule an Evaluation Today If you work on the computer for a good chunk of the day, suffer from migraines or experience dry eyes, let Lumen Optometric put relief in sight. We’re the only eye clinic in the San Gabriel Valley to offer neurolens treatment technology. In fact, we’re only the sixtieth clinic in the world to offer the neurolens!

It’s possible with Orthokeratology (Ortho K) from Lumen Optometric. Ortho K is an FDA approved, non surgical treatment that corrects your vision by gently reshaping your eyes while you sleep. In the morning, you simply remove your custom Ortho K lenses and experience clear vision all day! ORTHOKERATOLOGY FOR ADULTS: One of the biggest breakthroughs in correcting your myopia (aka nearsightedness) or hyperopia (aka farsightedness) is a process called Orthokeratology, or Ortho K, for short. It is a revolutionary system that accomplishes three things it corrects your vision while you sleep, removes the need for daytime distance glasses contacts, and allows you to avoid dryness, irritation, or allergies with traditional contacts. HOW IT KEEPS YOUR EYES HEALTHY: Relative to wearing soft contacts, which are worn for a period of 12 18 hours a day, Ortho K lenses are only worn while you sleep, so the overall wear time is much less. Additionally, these lenses are only worn under clean conditions (you’re at home!) so there’s much less of a chance of allergies and virus bacterial deposits. HOW IT GIVES YOU CLEAR VISION: You wear a special retainer like lens to sleep and upon waking, you remove the lenses. When the lenses are off, you will be able to see clearly for the rest of the day. Glasses or traditional contacts will never have to be worn again for the distance so long as you wear your Ortho K lenses to bed every night. Depending on your needs for reading, Ortho K can be modified to enhance your reading vision, but reading glasses might still be needed depending on your age and intensity of your near work. WHAT ELSE MAKES ORTHO K UNIQUE? Ortho K is only worn while in the comfort and cleanliness of your own home so you will never have to worry about losing breaking tearing glasses contacts while at work or participating in sports. It is a great option for farsighted patients who are having trouble adapting to wearing glasses. Additionally, it is also a wonderful option for athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, or patients with dry eyes or severe allergies who can no longer tolerate soft contact lenses.

There are no age requirements. I HAVE MYOPIA (aka NEARSIGHTEDNESS) WHAT IT MEANS: You were prescribed glasses for the distance (driving, TV, anything greater than a couple feet away). At a certain prescription, you see better up close without your glasses contacts. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t need to put on glasses to see in the distance any longer! *For those of you who are myopic but need reading help with progressive lenses, Ortho K can also be built with a reading enhancement to aid with reading. I HAVE ASTIGMATISM IT’S COMPLICATED: Astigmatism can occur with both myopia and hyperopia WHAT IT MEANS: You see slightly distortion and shadows without your glasses, which you might wear for both distance and near. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t experience the distortion nor shadows! I HAVE HYPEROPIA (AKA FARSIGHTEDNESS) Farsightedness is more complicated, it breaks down into two categories (simplified for this web format) CATEGORY 1: You’re farsighted and only have trouble with reading. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has been fairly clear for your whole life, but upon landing in your 40 50s, you find that you now need reading glasses. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t need reading glasses for most tasks and your distance will likely subtly improve. CATEGORY 2: You’re farsighted and have trouble with both reading and the distance. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has been clear up until your 30 40s, but now you need glasses for both distance and near. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: This scenario is the most life changing for patients! Ortho k essentially reverses your visual experience by about 20 years, back to a time when you were able to wake up seeing 100% clear. Other eye health factors need to be taken into account before initiating Orthokeratology. During an Ortho K consult, one of our doctors will review your complete visual and systemic health to ensure you’re a good candidate.

Candidacy Our Technology Frequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens Exams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID 19 Protocols Videos About Us Office Testimonials Blog Frequently Asked Questions Orthokeratology Frequently Asked Questions Below are the top ten most frequently asked questions. We have a longer list that can be emailed as well. I just have to sleep in these lenses to see clearly? Yes, the lenses gently mold your eyes while you sleep. As long as you sleep in the lenses for a continuous 6 8 hours, your vision will reach full, waking hour clarity within a 1 2 week time frame. So what do I wear in the meantime in those first 1 2 weeks? During your transition period and depending on the size type of your prescription, you will be given soft contacts or loaner glasses to ease the transition. What can I expect during the first 1 2 weeks? Your vision will become clearer day by day, and the clarity will last longer and longer with each passing day. But during the first couple of weeks, your vision will go from clear to your original level of blurriness by the day’s end. The period of blurriness decreases with each day until full clarity is reached. How does the lens feel? The lens is made with a more rigid material, so initially it’s more noticeable and requires a little more adaptation. The good news is that since the lenses are inserted right before bedtime, most of the adaptation takes place while you sleep! How long does the Ortho K effect last after the initial transition period? The vision correcting effect is programmed to last for ~24 hours, but some patients can experience clear vision for 36 hours without having to rewear the lens. How long your vision remains clear after 24 hours depends on the size of your prescription. Is vision clear while I’m wearing the Ortho k lenses? Yes, vision is very clear with the lenses on. They are designed not only to mold the cornea, but to also give you clear vision if you have to wake up in the middle of the night (for the restroom, emergency evacuations, etc). What happens if I miss a night? Patients with lower prescriptions don’t notice an obvious difference the next day, but patients with higher prescriptions will notice blurriness in the distance. Computer tasks for patients are definitely workable if you miss a night, but night driving is not recommended. Soft contacts can be given to you to make up for any residual blur. What happens if I decide to stop Ortho K? Your vision returns to normal over 2 3 weeks, sometimes faster. Are there any side effects to Ortho K? Glare is the primary side effect, which occurs with any refractive procedure such as LASIK PRK SMILE etc as well. Glare tends to be more noticeable in the initial adaptation period, which lasts 1 2 months. After that period, the brain learns to adapt and filter out residual glare. I thought it was unhealthy to sleep in contacts? Patients are told not to sleep in traditional contacts because they’re worn throughout the day, throughout sleep, and again in the daytime for a minimum of at least 30 hours of wear time. Additionally, debris germs mucus accumulate on traditional lenses, which your eye is then exposed to for the 30+ hours of wear. With Ortho K, you only wear them for a period of 7 8 hours maximum while under clean, home conditions.

Orthokeratology How’s Ortho K Work? Ortho K works somewhat similarly to a retainer for teeth in that they are worn overnight, but the similarities stop there. Ortho K works by gently reshaping the front surface of the eye (the cornea) while you sleep. The retainer lenses are inserted right before bedtime and removed after waking. Because the lenses are designed to correct your vision overnight, you will wake up with vision that will remain clear throughout your waking hours. The lenses are then re worn nightly to maintain clear vision. Recent advances in technology have allowed us to design Ortho K lenses that are created 100% from the shape of your eye. The custom nature of the lens allows for a healthier fitment.

Medmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300” being the gold standard topographer for over a decade. Their newest topographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more accurately capturing your cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your eye, which yields faster, healthier, and clearer outcomes. WAVE CUSTOM LENS DESIGN Lumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles County that employs WAVE to create 100% fully custom lenses for your eyes. WAVE combines all the topographical (corneal shape) data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and manipulate every aspect of your lens design. Custom design software is extremely critical for both clarity and eye health because each point of the lens is based on information from your cornea. Tip for inquiring patients – If you are told that you’re being fitted with custom lenses, ask to see your design. It should look similar to the screenshot above. If a doctor touts that they’re fitting a custom lens but is unable to show you a screenshot like the above where they can manipulate every aspect of every curve, they’re not designing a custom lens. All doctors will refer to their lenses as custom, but it is actually quite rare because of the difficult training, complicated CAD software, and cutting edge equipment that is required.

Scleral lenses are specialty, custom molded lenses that bring clear and comfortable vision to patients with corneal issues such as keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, or post LASIK complications. If your vision and comfort are lacking because of these complications, don’t settle. Sclerals represent the gold standard keratoconus treatment that is non surgical. Dr. Eric To is the only practice owning optometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society. We’d love for you to experience effortless vision, so reach out and let Lumen Optometric restore clarity and comfort to your vision. Scleral FAQs As a leading scleral optometrist, Lumen Optometric has the information you need. To give our valued patients more detailed insight about scleral lenses, we’ve compiled a convenient list of FAQs. What are scleral lenses? Scleral lenses are large diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (the clear window of the eye) and gently rest on the sclera (the white, outer layer of the eye). The rigid nature of the lenses makes your vision extremely crisp. Scleral lenses should not be confused with traditional gas permeable (GP) lenses. Traditional GP lenses are small lenses made of durable plastic that sit on the extremely sensitive cornea. Conversely, scleral lenses tend to be much more comfortable because they settle on the less sensitive sclera. Who is a candidate for scleral lenses? Many patients can benefit from scleral lenses, especially those suffering from: Keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration Higher prescriptions & visual needs that aren’t met by glasses or soft contacts Dry eyes, with or without soft contacts Glare distortion after LASIK, PRK or corneal transplants Exacting visual demands from things like sports, videography & photography Will I see a difference between scleral lenses and soft contact lenses? Scleral lens prescriptions offer greater vision and comfort than soft contact lenses because: Scleral lenses are built from highly customizable materials that offer the clearest, most stable vision correction. Scleral lenses sit on the less sensitive part of the eye and are inherently more stable. Scleral lenses offer options that make them more customizable for full distance clarity or for improved reading vision. Do all eye doctors fit scleral lenses? Not all eye doctors fit scleral lenses, but Lumen Optometric specializes in advanced scleral fitting! Our talented scleral optometrist uses an sMap3D instrument to capture a full 3D representation of your frontal eye. That custom scan helps us build a Scleral 2.0 lens that accurately fits your eye. Lumen Optometric is the only provider in the San Gabriel Valley to offer this state of the art technology, and we liken the process to creating a 100% custom made suit. Like a tailor designing a suit based on every measurement of your body, Lumen Optometric creates a scleral lens that is more accurate and a healthier fit for your eyes. What is a Scleral 2.0 lens? Traditional sclerals, or scleral 1.0 lenses, have been used for roughly a decade. The newer, more technologically advanced Scleral 2.0 lenses are customized specifically for your eye. So while creating a Scleral 2.0 lens is comparable to designing a custom made suit, fitting scleral 1.0 lenses is similar to modifying an off the rack suit: you select a suit size that approximates your body shape and make a limited number of adjustments to help the suit drape over your body’s contours. Our mission at Lumen Optometric is to aim for a flawless fit with your scleral lenses, not a best guess approximation. Check out these videos to see what a difference customized scleral lenses can make! What’s it like to be fit with Scleral 2.0 lenses? An advanced scleral lens fitting starts with both corneal and scleral topography. A corneal topographer maps the cornea, the clear window of the eye. Scleral topography is a separate, dedicated instrument that can scan the elevation changes of your eye’s white surface. This painless procedure does not require dilation drops, but it does require the use of a temporary dye that enhances our scans. We then place a calibrated “test” scleral lens on your eye. That test lens gives you an opportunity to try out a scleral lens and gives us time to fine tune your prescription. Once your prescription data is obtained, it’s combined with the shape data to create your fully customized scleral lens. Please note that during a scleral lens consultation, we take all necessary measurements of your eye. Be prepared to set aside 60 minutes of eye doctor time to ensure that the measurements are correct. What is the best keratoconus treatment for me? Or if I have pellucid marginal degeneration or any other condition where the cornea is no longer consistent in its shape (post LASIK RK corneal transplant), how will sclerals help me? Sclerals are the best keratoconus treatment available, they’re the gold standard! They will give you clear, distortion free vision. Think of an irregular cornea as the warped windshield of a car. That warping distorts what you see through the windshield, leading to extreme glare in addition to distorted vision. When you fill a custom scleral lens with conditioning solution and apply it to your eye, the solution “mates” the scleral with your cornea to give you a new, smooth, regular surface to see through. This perfectly contoured surface cancels out your distortion and blur, leaving you with clear and comfortable vision. The outcomes are the same for keratoconus, pellucid, or any other type of corneal irregularity. If I’m already wearing glasses or contacts and I see acceptably, will scleral lenses make a difference? That depends on how you define acceptable. Most people are fairly adaptable to the options they’re given, so until you’re shown a difference, you may not be aware that the potential for improvement exists. For example, if you’ve been wearing the same set of contacts for nearly a decade, there’s a good chance you’re missing out on clearer, healthier and more comfortable technology. Lumen Optometric can keep you up to date on the best and healthiest options for your only set of eyes. The impact of scleral lenses also depends on your prescription. If you have an extremely minimal prescription, scleral lenses will be more helpful in correcting dry eyes or performance based vision. If you have a moderate or high prescription with astigmatism, the benefit of sclerals will be vision that’s clearer and more stable. Visual stability is something many of us take for granted until we are shown what true stability looks like. For example, consider the fluidity of the newer 120hz televisions relative to their older 60hz counterparts. 60hz televisions looked normal to us until the 120hz upgrades were released. When patients have high levels of astigmatism, scleral lenses provide results similar to that of seeing an image on a brand new, high definition television for the first time! Corneal health is another factor to consider. If you have any corneal issues, scleral lenses will significantly impact your vision and improve your quality of life. If my eyes are dry, how can sclerals help me? When you apply a scleral lens to your eye, the “bowl” of the lens is filled with sterile conditioning solution. This conditioning solution is held against your eye for as long as you wear the lens, creating a moisture chamber that helps alleviate your dry eye. Of course, scleral lenses represent only one treatment modality within a greater dry eye treatment system. Severely chronic dry eye patients may need additional treatments to overcome their dryness symptoms, and Lumen Optometric has several dry eye treatment plans available.

Researchers believe that the environment kids grow up in today, with too many close distance activities (like reading and device use) and lack of outdoor play, is contributing to the rapid increase in childhood myopia. While glasses and contact lenses compensate for a child’s blurry vision, they don’t stop your child’s vision from continuing to deteriorate. As children grow, myopia often develops as they reach school age and progresses into their late teens or early twenties. The Dangers of Myopia Researchers now know there is more to worry about with myopic eyes than the inconvenience of ever thickening lenses. Scientific evidence has proven that myopic patients are more vulnerable to a range of sight threatening diseases and complications. In fact, myopia is the sixth leading cause of blindness. Patients with mild myopia have a four fold increase in the risk of retinal detachment. For those with moderate to severe myopia, the risk increases ten times. One study concluded that more than 50 percent of retinal detachments not related to trauma are associated with myopia. Other myopia risks include glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration. Myopia Can Be Managed The dangers of myopia, in conjunction with the normal challenges of subpar vision, mean it is important for parents of myopic children to manage the condition as part of your child’s eye health. The goal of myopia management is to slow the progression of myopia and reduce its impact on your child’s life. The younger myopia management begins, the more effective the treatment. We are excited at Lumen Optometric to announce the launch of our children’s myopia management service in partnership with Treehouse Eyes®, the country’s leading myopia management service. The revolutionary system, designed to treat your child’s myopia and significantly reduce the threat of more serious eye diseases, is one of the most important innovations since glasses were first prescribed hundreds of years ago!

TREEHOUSE EYES® MYOPIA MANAGEMENT FOR CHILDREN Is myopia unhealthy? SO WHY DID THE SCREEN MOVE FURTHER BACK WITH MYOPIC PATIENTS? This is due to the whole eye growing longer in depth, which occurs in myopic patients. This front to back elongation moves the retina (the screen) beyond the point where the cornea (the projector) expects to concentrate its light to a focus. SO WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? When the outer shell of the eye (the sclera) elongates, it forces all the internal components that line the inside of the eye (the retina) to also stretch. There are two problems with an enlarged eye and a stretched retina: Problem #1 – A nuisance Your child has to wear stronger glasses contacts every time their prescription increases. They become dependent on glasses contacts from the moment their eyes open in the morning to when their eyes close for bedtime. Problem #2 – A health concern The stretched retina is thinned and weakened, which leads to a higher risk of blinding eye diseases, such as myopic maculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts.

IS IT NATURE OR NURTURE? The bad news: there is a clear connection between parents passing their nearsighted genes to their children. The good news: your genetics are not entirely to blame! Even though myopic inheritance has been established, the steep rise in myopia over the past 50 60 years cannot be due to inheritance alone. In the graph above, you will notice that in the 1940s, the prevalence of myopia in this select group of East Asian university students was 10% to 37%. If you fast forward to the present, the prevalence is staggering; it is over 80% to 90%! It is impossible for such a sudden shift to have occurred in the gene pool of those nations so the cause cannot be genetics alone. In looking for the cause of this progression, researchers studied the visual demands of those university students. It was demonstrated that the average student in Shanghai was responsible for 15 hours of homework per week, compared to 6 hours per week in the United States. Even though the prevailing thought that excessive close work leads to more myopia, they found something else more interesting. They found that it was the lack of outdoor time that led to an earlier and more rapid nearsighted progression! One thing that is clear based on the epidemiological studies, and it is that genetics alone cannot account for this explosive myopic epidemic. ARE ELECTRONIC DEVICES HARMING MY CHILD’S EYES? The answer is a complicated “yes.” The logic of excessive screen time worsening vision is sound, but there has been no conclusive evidence that screen time alone contributes to myopic progression. What is known is that with every moment our children are spending time indoors with their eyes glued to screens, they are not spending those moments outdoors. This is where science has stepped in to find a strong correlation between outdoor playtime and the slowed or delayed onset of myopia. Children who spend a couple of hours outdoors every day have been found to be four times less likely to become myopic. Our stance when it comes to screen time is both scientifically driven and rooted in common sense. Being outdoors provides the healthy sunlight our eyes and skin need. It’s also fantastic for both physical and visual development. Being less sedentary and more active outdoors enforces better hand eye coordination, depth perception, and eye coordination skills. All efforts should be made to reduce screen time when possible for these reasons.

Zeiss IOLMaster Optical Biometer An optical biometer is traditionally used by surgeons to perform power calculations for lenses that are to be implanted in the eye. We utilize optical biometry for a different reason: to measure the length of your child’s eye, which is referred to as axial length. As your child grows, their eyes grow as well. Our goal is early detection and differentiation between natural growth of the eye versus accelerated myopic progression. Since a longer eye leads to a stretched retina (which has its own complications as seen in the “Is Myopia Unhealthy” page), it’s critical that we know the rate at which your child’s eyes are growing. Previously, the only known method to monitor the eye’s growth was through the prescription, but each prescription does not correlate with a specific eye length. Typically, prescription changes lag axial length changes, which means that if you only monitor through prescription, chances are that you will miss length changes that may have already occurred. Treehouse Eyes affiliates such as our office are one of the few offices in all of Los Angeles County that employ technology solely to measure axial length for children. Medmont Meridia Corneal Topographer A leading edge topographer is critical to monitor how the cornea (the clear window of the eye) changes over time with myopia treatments. Medmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300” being the gold standard topographer for a decade. Their newest topographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more accurately capturing your child’s cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your child’s eye, which yields faster and better outcomes. Medmont partnered with Lumen Optometric to help launch the new gold standard and we’re proud to be able to offer this latest form of technology to our patients. WAVE Custom Lens Design Lumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles county that employs WAVE to create 100% fully custom lenses for your child. WAVE combines all the topographical data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and manipulate every aspect of your child’s lens design. From a doctor’s perspective, the customizable nature of WAVE allows for (1) maximum myopia management, (2) more accurate vision correction, (3) increasing the level of myopia protection in a lens. For patients, it simply means their eyes are more protected from myopic progression, they see better and arrive at a clear endpoint in less time. Aren’t All Lenses Custom? Depending on the type of lens a practitioner may be limited to (either due to technology or training), their definition of custom will differ. This is an overview of the three different types of “custom” lenses you will encounter as a patient parent. Basic custom – These types of ortho k lenses are similar to off the rack suits in that they come in a predefined size. Depending on your needs, the suit is then upsized or downsized to another predefined size. “Basic custom” ortho k lenses exist in certain parameters and different lenses are selected based on visual estimation. Due to the lack of true personalization, your child can share the same lens design as another patient. Semi custom – This category of ortho k lenses begins to incorporate technology such as topography in the design of the lens. Lens design software will use the topographical data to generate a lens off of an pre established template. To return to the suit analogy, measurements are taken for a suit to be made, but the suits still have certain non modifiable assumptions made about the proportions. And if a suit has to be modified, you still operate within those non modifiable template assumptions. Fully custom – WAVE lenses are all fully custom designs. WAVE lenses incorporate topographical data of the eye which can then be fully manipulated by a Certified WAVE Designer (CWD). Every aspect of the lens can be changed relative to one another, leading to the most form fitting and visually effective lens. We utilize WAVE lenses because our patients see the best out of them! Tip – If a doctor can’t show you the visual layout of your child’s lens design with numerical readouts of those design elements, it’s likely not a fully custom lens. If you point to any one aspect of the design and ask for it to be changed in real time for demonstration, yet it can’t, it’s likely not a fully custom lens. Lastly, fully custom lenses are all doctor designed from start to finish, meaning that the lenses are all designed in house by the same doctor taking care of your child. Basic or semi custom lens designers outsource their change requests to lens consultants. Fully custom lenses require more training to design and troubleshoot, in addition to requiring very specific hardware. We only fit fully custom lenses because they are the healthiest option for your child. Schedule a Consultation to Discuss Lumen Optometric offers consultations to discuss myopia management.

TREEHOUSE EYES® MYOPIA MANAGEMENT FOR CHILDREN What is myopia? WHAT IS MYOPIA & WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT PROGRESSES? When your child is myopic (which leads to nearsightedness), it means that distant objects are blurrier than near objects. To understand why this occurs, let’s first consider how a perfect eye works. Consider when conditions are perfect: When light passes through the clear, front window of the eye (cornea), it is focused on the inner lining of the eye (retina). Here’s an analogy (Figure 1): think of the cornea as a movie projector, with the retina as a projector screen. The projector and the screen are 20 feet apart, and the projector casts its image 20 feet away onto the screen. The result is a clear image. Consider when the conditions are imperfect: A nearsighted eye is longer, which causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it, leading to a blurry image (Figure 2). Imagine the projector casting an image 20 feet away, but with the projector screen now sitting 25 feet away, which leads to a blurry, out of focus picture.

       " Document(page_content=\"All right, we have Vivian here and Vivian is going to help us out with a testimonial for her new Ortho K lenses. And so she has a little bit of history about Ortho K and if you could fill us in about it. So I did Ortho K when I was a little bit younger, like when I was 18 and then I did it for a couple of years and I have been using the same lenses for a while and later on I decided to try to switch a lens because my vision has gone a little bit worse. So I wanted to see if there's any chances that I can make my original lens a little bit better. So, and my boyfriend introduced me to Lumen, so that's how I come here. Gotcha. All right. So we're done with our fit now and so what's your vision like? It is perfect. I can see pretty far away. Like it used to have a lot of glares when I wore my older lenses. Now I have less glare and then obviously I can, I can actually look like way better at night because before when I was like trying to like go downstairs, I couldn't really see well and sometimes I even like fall, but now it's like a little bit better. Gotcha. Oh, wonderful. Yeah. I think when it comes to Vivian's lenses, she has a bit more myopia and she has a special type of astigmatism that's more internal. So the lenses have to be able to counter, counteract that astigmatism. That's probably what she had before. And since she had the 100% custom lenses, we were able to mold that out. So as of right now, she has pretty much, she has essentially zero astigmatism residual in both eyes. So what about the fitting process? The fitting process is great. Women really like, really pay attention to a lot of details. When I have any concerns, I would just shoot them a text and they're usually just respond right away. I don't have to like wait a couple of days before I get my answers back. And overall, like on the other hand, scheduling is a little bit more difficult, but obviously any like good practice is going to be like this. And usually they are really punctual. They see you mostly on time. Yeah, yeah. We try. We try. Yeah, I know. Especially during the holidays too, the scheduling gets a little bit, we do get a little bit more booked out. But we try. We like to think even though we're booked out when patients get here, that we give them the full 100%. And so we like to think we're worth waiting for, but hopefully you think that's true. But otherwise, it seems like you're happy and we're glad, so we're always here to support you. Okay. So thank you so much for your testimony.

       " Document(page_content=\"Let's learn how to insert your Ortho-K lenses. First, wash your hands thoroughly, and now we're ready to start. For the first week, use the artificial tear comfort drops and place one drop in each eye and allow them to settle for 10 seconds. Now take out the given insertion solution and open it. In this case, it's SolaroFill. Next, take out the cleaning case. Unscrew the case, set aside the bottom half, and take out your right lens. After you take the right lens, balance it on the tip of the index finger of your dominant hand. Now take the insertion solution and place two drops into your right lens. Lean forward into the mirror, take a calming breath, and insert the lens gently. Congratulations! You've successfully inserted your Ortho-K lenses. To remove your Ortho-K lenses, use the SolaroFill and place one drop in each eye and blink several times. Now take the small plunger, center it, and apply light pressure to the lens. Rock the lens off your eye. To clean the lens that you just removed, take the cleaning case and remove the top half. Open up the basket for the right lens and insert the lens into the basket. Very carefully, close the case over the basket, making sure not to clip the lens. Repeat with your left lens. Now take the bottom half of the cleaning case and fill it up to the line on the case. Now take the top half of the case and screw it onto the bottom half. Let the case sit for at least 6 hours to disinfect. Note, never place any drops of the red capped bottle directly into your eye.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e_XRLQvjmE', 'chunk': 0, 'description': 'Inserting & Removing Your Orthokeratology Lenses', 'title': 'Inserting & Removing Your Orthokeratology Lenses'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"All right, so we have Tony and we have Aiden here and they've gone through our myopia management program. Aiden's currently wearing Ortho-K lenses. And so let's hear it. What do you think about your lenses so far? I like them. Gotcha. So what's it like now when you wake up and the fact that you can see? It's amazing. I'm glad. Okay. Yeah. It's nice to be able to wake up and just see and not have to find your glasses, right? Perfect. Okay. So one thing we keep in mind too is waking up, being able to see is pretty much, it's like a side benefit. It's like a bonus because since Aiden started, his prescriptions been stable with us. And the goal is to keep your prescription low so that your eyes healthier as you get older. Okay. And so we're protecting you there. And then for Tony, what's your experience been like going through the whole process from start to finish? It's been really great. It's been a lot easier than we had anticipated. The initial steps of him getting sized and fitted and everything was really easy. It was painless. Even the initial period when he was getting used to wearing them and putting them in, he struggled the first one to three days. And then after that, we wouldn't even give it a second thought, it was just automatic. We had thought it might be challenging for him to remember to put them on before going to bed and to put them away when he wakes up. But it's just part of his normal routine and I think, and maybe the, I don't even know how long it's been that he's been wearing them now. It's been almost about six months. Six months? Yeah. In that six month period, I think there might've only been one night when he didn't wear them because we got home too late and he was too sleepy to put them in. But aside from that, he's worn them every night and he doesn't seem to have any issues taking them out in the morning. He's transitioned from using the plunger to not using the plunger and he can just take it out without using it. So that's been really easy. We haven't experienced anything adverse. He does a lot of physical activities of biking and bodyboarding and snowboarding season's coming back up again. It's great for him to be able to do all these things without needing glasses or us having to fiddle with getting prescription goggles or anything like that. So it's really, really wonderful. Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. It sounds like, especially since you're so active, it's really been helpful for you. Especially with snowboarding. I hear there's a bunch of snow on the mountain high, so that would be perfect. Or especially when you guys stay at Big Bear, right? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. I feel like it's really, I mean, it's great for the kids. It's really great for the parents to not have to worry about him losing a contact or breaking glasses or forgetting to bring glasses. He's ready to go whenever it's time to do something. Gotcha. Yeah. Especially when it's all under parental supervision. So you know the lens, if something falls out of his eye, it's going to be at home. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well, thank you so much for your input. I really appreciate it.

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, it's Dr. Toe here. I just have a quick message to deliver on a great tip that I learned about face masks and glasses fogging up. So if you do wear your glasses throughout the day or even on the computer and you find that they're constantly fogging up, this tip will be perfect for you. So let me show you what to do. So let me hook this one on here first. And so what you need for this tip is a piece of tissue paper. And so I have the tissue, fold it once, fold it twice, fold it three times, and one last fold. And this fold will be essentially the width of your mask, okay? So there we go. And now if you have your face mask, you want to place it right over the nose piece right here. And make sure the nose piece is well contoured for your nose. If you place this on, and there we go. So it reduces the amount of fog coming through. I like to think of it as an accordion sort of gasket to keep the moisture from moving up there. And so hopefully this helps you out. Now one big thing to remind you of though is throughout the day, if you are in contact with anybody where there's any potential COVID in the air, you want to make sure you're not constantly touching your mask. So in the very beginning of the day, if you do this, then that's perfectly fine when you know that your hands are clean and disinfected. But if you're midway through the day, you don't want to take off your mask and futz with it, and then put it back on your face. That's definitely something you don't want to do, okay? Otherwise, any other questions at the end, you'll have our information pop up about our website and the phone numbers that you can call or text us. And I want to put a shout out to Dr. Tony Liu for helping us out with this great tip. It was wonderful.

Oh, gotcha. Okay, so three sports. And so what was it like before you had CRT for soccer and for swimming? For soccer, like sometimes like when I would run a lot, it would all like, like over here, it would get sweaty, so sometimes it would fall off.

We always try to provide Bon with as much information so that she knows that we're taking the best care of Tanya. And so what about your experiences? What do you, what do you think? Like for me, I like so, so much, like even like at school, even like lots of things, like no broken glasses, no changing, no like lost, lost glasses. Also her face looked different, like and more comfortable with the class, with like sports, all this stuff. And it is easy, like in the beginning, she like, one day she learned how to put them in and take them off and that's it. Yeah, she was, she was really dedicated. She's probably one of the most dedicated little ones in terms of learning how to insert that lens. You can tell she, in the beginning, you know, it was a little tough, but from watching Tanya, like she's going to get it and she'll, she gets it, you know, it's going to, it's going to be there for forever. Yeah, like it make, like one of my friends, like when she saw Tanya without the glasses, she said, oh my God, like her face, it's like, the people who wear sometimes the glasses, even like for Tanya, because it is very hot, like sometimes do like this. So take the habit doing like this, her face like shrinking like that, but now it's open. She said her face is much open. I can see her smile better. Everything is much better. Yeah, don't hide behind the glasses anymore. Yeah, we were speaking about this a little before we decided to record the video and you had mentioned even about just confidence levels. Yeah. And so that's, that's one thing as a practitioner we see all the time. Yeah. My other daughter, like she doesn't like them and she's struggling with her friend and they ask her, why are you wearing them? Why? So I start telling them, tell them I, because I'm clever. I read a lot only to make her feel different. Like why she's wearing glasses, like, not like other people, which is normal. But Tanya now, like a normal people doesn't wear any glasses and no one knows, like she has contact lenses at night and take them off in the morning. Yeah. It's really special.

       " Document(page_content=\"This is an eye looking straight up towards the ceiling, and this is an ortho-k lens placed on the eye. Ortho-k lenses are shaped differently than standard contacts. They take on what I call a volcanic shape. Ortho-k lenses work by creating negative pressure, also known as suction, in the region under these humps. The cells then migrate and multiply in this region, ever so slightly thickening the zone. The cornea then takes on the shape of the ortho-k retainer lens. Now here's why ortho-k is special. Let's go back to the picture that we sketched in a previous Why do eyes get worse video. Remember how traditional glasses and contacts over corrected your child's peripheral vision, which led to the accelerated growth of the eye? With ortho-k, there's a unique optical effect that occurs. First, it allows your child to maintain clear vision wherever they're looking. Optically, ortho-k lenses cause the peripheral vision to be focused inside of the eye instead of behind it. Because the peripheral vision is focused inside of the eye, it reduces the stimulus for accelerated growth. And without the stimulus for growth, the eye will retain a smaller shape and your child's eyes will remain healthier for life.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhtuaIazLIw', 'chunk': 0, 'description': 'How Ortho-K Works & How It Slows Myopia', 'title': 'How Ortho-K Works & How It Slows Myopia'}),\n",

And so, could you describe a little bit about your vision overall when you had slurls and versus when you didn't have slurls? So, a little history on my background is I did LASIK, found out I had Cerebral Conus because after LASIK my vision kept dropping on my right eye. From there, my vision just basically was getting worse and worse. I got crosslinking done, after crosslinking my vision stayed at one point, but since my vision was, I would say, really bad to the point on my right eye where this is the clarity that I needed, like something had to be this close for my right eye to be able to even see it clearly. It was throwing off my vision compared to my left eye, which is a lot stronger. So, slurl lenses has helped me correct my vision where now I'm able to drive and I'm able to do my work and especially needed being in the tech industry, I need my eyes for that reason alone. Yeah, yeah. Prom's a busy guy, so for him to be able to use his eyes without having to think about it throughout the day, just being there for him to be able to see clearer is always important.

And so I'm recording this today just to make sure that we have a little bit more clarity in terms of contact lenses. I've been seeing some news reports that mention that contact lenses aren't healthy to wear during times of the COVID pandemic. And I just want to make sure that everybody knows that there's absolutely no scientific basis, there's no studies that point towards any contact lens wear being unhealthy. And so there's some very specific guidelines to follow to make sure that you're wearing contact lenses in a healthy manner. And so most of these we've gone over with you in training or after you've worn contacts just as a quick touch point. And so one thing is to make sure your eyes washing your hands, okay, so 20 seconds is what we're aiming for here, I'd say a good solid 10 seconds of soaping, 10 seconds of rinsing and drying your hands very well, then and only then should you handle your lenses in the morning. So place them in and the rest of the day, as long as you're not touching your eyes or your face, then you'll be perfectly fine. In terms of disinfection, you have to make sure that you're disinfecting them well too. So most of the times we prefer the peroxide based solution, cleansers, and so usually you'll have a little case and you'll fill it with a solution that has a red cap and after six hours, it'll be completely disinfected. So if you're wearing lenses that you discard every two weeks or every month, or if you're wearing corneal reshaping lenses, you definitely want to make sure you're continuously cleaning your lenses every night or throughout the day, depending on how you wear your lenses. Now for daily disposables, when you do remove them at the end of the day, make sure again, your hands are clean, but you would just discard those lenses, okay? So again, so long as you're keeping your hands clean and you're disinfecting your lenses, there's nothing to worry about in terms of wearing your contact lenses. Again, if you have any questions, give us a call or you can email us or text us on our main line. You can find all that information on our website and hopefully we'll get to see you guys soon. It's been almost about a month that we've closed our doors temporarily. We really miss all of you and so take care and take care of one another, okay?

So, um, I'm 52 and when I, the last probably five years, my eyes have been getting progressively worse, but it got to the point where I was up to like almost 3.0 readers. And if I was without my glasses, I was literally, I felt blind. It was kind of scary. It was a little bit scary. I felt like it's something really wrong. I didn't know if there was something really wrong with my eyes or I was just getting old. So I booked an appointment here because I didn't have a really an eye doctor that I had been using. I've been sort of self doing my readers. And so that was it. So then I ended up here and that's when I found out about ortho. Okay. I didn't know about it before. So great. So what's your vision like now? It's great. I don't even need glasses at all. So I don't use that. I don't use readers. My distance is fine and it's the greatest thing ever. I feel like I'm about 25 again. Sounds wonderful. Yeah. I still have patients. It's like where it was specifically when it comes to your situation, right? Because you're farsighted. And so for the longest time, I mean, you didn't wear glasses up until pretty recently. Yeah. Yeah. So your distance was always fairly good. And then all of a sudden your reading starts to go and then your distance follows along with that. Yeah. And I didn't even realize my distance was bad until my eye exam. Like I didn't even think I had, I would never have guessed I even had a little distance issue, but this worked out perfect. I've told so many people, my sister wants to do it.

We're the first practice in Los Angeles County that's partnered with Treehouse Eyes, which is the national leader in myopia care for kids. And our goal is to provide the latest forms of treatments for myopia for your children to keep their eyes healthy for life. And myopia has been more of an issue. It has to do with all the screen time nowadays, kids have to spend much more time indoors, especially staying at home, staring at their screens as opposed to going to school. There's a lot less time spent outdoors, and all that research points to their eyes worsening. And what we also know now through research is that glasses and standard contacts also worsen myopia as well. And all this is a problem because myopia is unchecked growth of the eye. And so when the eye stretches, all the internal elements aren't meant to stretch that much. So when they're forced to stretch, it leads to greater risks of eye diseases in life, which is not great for their vision. Additionally, it's more difficult to get through life with a very high prescription as opposed to a very small prescription. Now, since we've partnered with Treehouse Eyes, we've been making investments in technology. And the technology allows us to more accurately and quickly monitor your child's myopic progression, so that we can combine research treatments to be able to slow or stop that progression. Now, for more information, you can look down below for our phone number, give us a call, and we'll guide you through it. You can also look on our website under myopia management. There's a lot more information about the specific types of treatments we offer, in addition to the technology that we employ to keep your children's eyes healthy. Now, if we work together, we can keep your children's eyes healthy for life. Okay, hope to see you soon.

Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, these symptoms do come, for some patients, they all come together. Patients will have headaches, or dryness specifically is a big one. For some patients, they have dry eye symptoms, but their eyes technically aren't dry when we look for signs of dryness, and so sometimes lenses like NeuroLens can ease those symptoms, too. And they've been really helping you out then, right? They have, yes. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I'm glad. Okay, so thank you for sharing your story with us. You're welcome.

       " Document(page_content=\"All right, so we have Leslie here, and she's wearing neural lenses, and so can you talk a little bit about what your symptoms were like in the very beginning? Yes. I had really extreme eye fatigue to the point where I couldn't even drive anymore, and I was getting really scared that it was going to be forever. I would have extremely gritty feeling in my eyes. I would have to drive with one eye closed and then switch to the other eye. I would go through bottles of drops in a couple of weeks, and of course headaches and back aches, but really primarily I just felt like my eyes were in total pain, like I had a rubber band wrapped around them, and there was a whole bunch of sand in there. It was very painful. So good news now. It doesn't feel that way anymore, huh? Yeah. It's a huge difference, really huge. I can drive again. I was saying that one of my triggers was being in a dark room with lit screens, which was terrible for work meetings. I would sit in those meetings with my eyes closed, and people would think I was bored or tired. It was very embarrassing. I had to explain it to everybody, but I had a big test where I was at a conference for a whole week like this, and it was pretty great. I could go the whole day at the conference without problems. Yeah, that's wonderful. I mean, being able to do what you need to do without having all that discomfort, it really adds up. You think about the little bits of discomfort throughout the day, and you stretch it out over 8 to 10, 12 hours, and then it really starts adding up. I'm in animal care, and quality of life is something we discuss a lot, and my quality of life was pretty low, because it was on my mind just constantly, constantly bothering me. So, yeah, it's really improved my quality of life. So, you recommend it to family or friends if they have the same type of symptoms? Absolutely. I plan on telling people. I plan on posting about it. Hey, do you have these symptoms? You should see a specialist if you're in the area. So, yeah. I will be singing the praises of these lenses for sure. Yeah, I'm glad they really help you. What about your skepticism? Yeah, I was going to say, I was really skeptical. The thing is, I could see just fine, and for the most part, everything seemed like the glasses I was wearing was suited for what I needed, but I was having some sort of internal problem. In a way, I was, but really, I just didn't understand how lenses could fix that problem. But these are complex lenses, and they're really amazing, and my husband and I both did all the research. We thought it sounded a little cuckoo, but it was our last thing to try. So, really, it's, I am, I believe it now. Yeah. I'm so glad that they're working out for you. It sounds like such a cliche. I know. At the end, it always gets a little tricky. I'm a believer. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you so much for your time, and I'm glad everything's working out well for you. \", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb_PLkwmTl8', 'chunk': 0, 'description': 'Testimonial Neurolens', 'title': \"Eye Fatigue Treatment - Leslie's Neurolens Testimonial\"}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"All right, so we have Natasha here. Natasha is going to help us out with an Ortho-K testimonial. So, tell us about how was your vision before Ortho-K? So, I had pretty moderate astigmatism and myopia. I had LASIK about 13 years ago and thought that I'd have a good long period of time without glasses after that, but unfortunately my astigmatism came back pretty meaningfully. And I tried a lot of different solutions to address it, soft contacts, glasses. I got re-evaluated for TouchUp LASIK, PRK, all kinds of different solutions. And ultimately, the only really comfortable way to address it was through wearing glasses. And after having enjoyed a period of time without glasses after LASIK, I was really looking for another option to go back to being able to go about my day without wearing anything and having kind of easy get up and go routine. And so, after I learned about Ortho-K, I started to research options and that seemed like a good fit for me. Gotcha. So, what's your vision like now? So, after a period of adjustment, it's great. I can see really clearly. I don't need glasses in the morning. I've gotten to a point now where things have settled where I don't even need glasses to read or work during the day. And it's super convenient. I'm really happy with the results. I'm glad. Yeah, the astigmatism is no joke. I mean, you're seeing quite a bit of shadows on things before. A lot of fuzziness, a lot of doubles of things, especially when I read books or when I read things on a computer. And that is like greatly diminished almost to a part where I can't notice it anymore. I know. In the past, when we're looking at the chart there, we're stuck at around 2050, 2070, but now we're really scrutinizing the 2020 line. Exactly, exactly. Yes, I'm super happy about that. Very excited. I'm glad. So, how about your experience? Did you feel as if we took good care of you? Yeah, yeah. I think for me, it was really important to find a place where, you know, you were using like the latest technology, using all the right tools. I think the process that we went through, there were a lot. I felt really good about the quality in terms of both the service and then also the equipment that you're using to get measurements. And then when I got the lenses that also felt really high quality and we've been able to adjust the lenses over time through all the customization that you do to get to a really good fit. And so, you know, for something that I heard by reputation wasn't super comfortable to wear, they're actually pretty comfortable. You know, I don't really notice it when I go to sleep at night. And so, it's all around been a really good experience. I'm glad. And the team is great. Really nice. Everyone's really helpful and the service is really great. Hey, Natasha is really easy to work with. She's super mellow and easygoing. So, thank you so much for telling your story and we appreciate your time. I'm kind of surprised that not more people know about OrthoK actually. I think people have an impression that it's more for younger kids, which is actually how I knew about it in the first place. But having this as an option, not having to do LASIK and deal with all the potential complications, if I had known that this was an option years ago, I probably would have done this instead. Yeah, but a lot of times practitioners who do fit it don't always bring it up for adults because adults are a lot more discerning. Right. So, it does usually take more effort when it comes to adults. Interesting. But I like fine-tuning. I mean, it makes it happy. Definitely, it's more vision-changing, life-changing. Yeah, and having the option to change it over time as my vision changes would have been a meaningful thing to understand about LASIK. They kind of warn you about that, but the way that they position it is when you get old enough to have to use reading glasses, that's when you will go back to glasses. They don't talk about astigmatism coming back, right? And that's, I think, I gather more common than, you know, I understood. So, if I had known that, I probably would have more seriously considered this. All right. Well, thank you so much. For sure. Thank you.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIoA_bIo8hE', 'chunk': 0, 'description': 'Testimonial Ortho-K Orthokeratology Myopia Management', 'title': 'Ortho-K Helps Natasha Back To Clarity After LASIK'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"All right, so here we have Maricela, and Maricela is, she's a ESMAP scleral lens patient too, and she's nice enough to help us out with the patient testimony. So how's your day going? Good. Good? All right. Yeah, so in terms of your vision, I mean, you were diagnosed with keratoconus, and so I think when I first saw you, do you remember some of your initial complaints? Yeah, I had a lot of glare wearing my glasses. I had, I couldn't necessarily see, even with like a new updated prescription, I couldn't see very clearly, very long distance, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I remember when we tried glasses on you initially, and the glasses, there was sort of a limit to your vision, and it's because the cornea is distorted when it comes to keratoconus, so having the scleral lens effectively gives you a new surface to work from. So how's your vision now? My vision is better. It's improved. I can see more clearly. The details of what I can see now, it's just, I mean, they're magnified. I mean, they're just, it's impressive how much I can see, which, yeah, I never knew you could see that many details. Yeah. I think, yeah, you were talking about even being able to see dry skin on your kid's teeth. Dry skin patches, I can see very tiny hair follicles on people's faces. Yeah. That's the interesting part. Yeah. Yeah. I can see a lot of details. Yeah, positives and negatives there. So I think in terms of glare, I did cut down some glare. I think erasing all the glare is still a difficult task, but I think, would you say it's still substantially reduced and more comfortable to drive now? It is, yeah. It is very comfortable to drive, especially during daytime. I, um, it's just, um, yeah, it's like distance wise, I can see better. Um, the, yeah, the glare part, I, it doesn't, I notice it obviously in the evening, but it doesn't bother me as much. Yeah. That's the part that has really improved. And then how about comfort with your lenses on? I, I don't feel them. So, um, perhaps I've gotten used to it, but I, years ago I had tried, um, uh, soft lenses I guess, contacts, and it felt like there was sand in my eyes. I mean, it was just like really uncomfortable. I couldn't get used to them. And these, I don't feel these, I, I can wear them for 12 hours. And, um, there was a day where I wore them longer than 12 hours and it was still comfortable. You know, see, well, I was working on the computer and it was just really, everything was really intact. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. And when it comes to these, I mean, you, since you're familiar with how you fill them up are, uh, the listeners might not be, but you basically fill it with solution and then you place it in the eye. So it's holding solution up against your eye all day long. Whereas soft contacts, if you take it out of your eye and you put it on the table, it basically turns into a potato chip about a minute later. Where these hold their structure and they don't require your tears in order to stay hydrated. Yeah. No, and I do. And I feel that I feel the hydration with the solution. It feels, yeah, I do feel it. That's like a damn cool feeling. It's like air conditioning for your eyes without the dryness. Yeah. That's how it feels. Yeah. So overall, it sounds like you're happy with this. Yes. It's perfect. And I wasn't sure I was going to be, and in the beginning it was challenging to put them on, but that lasted only, I don't know, maybe a week and I became more comfortable with it. Yeah. Putting my, you know, stuff in my eyes and yeah, I'm very happy I made this transition. I'm glad. Well, thank you, Maricela.

       " Document(page_content=\"Here is a perfect eye that doesn't need a prescription, looking to the left. Light is focused by the cornea onto the inner surface of the eye, the retina. This is what is required to see clearly. For our young patients that become myopic, which leads to nearsightedness, their eyes elongate and the world now falls out of focus. Glasses or contacts are traditionally used to correct this blur. But, as myopic parents know, the first pair of glasses or contacts is never the last. When a child wears traditional glasses or contacts, it corrects their central vision. But it wasn't until recently that we learned two new things. First, we learned that traditional glasses and contacts overcorrect their peripheral vision. Second, we learned that the brain pays more attention to the peripheral vision to regulate how the eye grows. Since the brain is watching this region, it grows the eye to land itself back on the plane of clear vision. This cycle repeats itself over and over again into adulthood, leading to worsening vision and eye health.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZrM2L1h8w', 'chunk': 0, 'description': 'How And Why Do Eyes Worsen?', 'title': 'How And Why Do Eyes Worsen?'}),\n",

Her eyes are quite asymmetric, one eye's a lot higher than the other one, so previous contacts didn't work out so well. Even with glasses sometimes, it's not always that comfortable. I have my whole life had a lot of trouble with getting my prescription right. I had one eye doctor ask me, he made a joke, he said, he wondered if I had a seeing eye bug. I had another person tell me that I was legally blind basically without, that my vision corrected. And I can't, I can't see anything at all without any assistance. So yeah, but what I've always appreciated is that eventually when I do have glasses and contact lenses, I see fine. So I mean, right now we have you fit in the SLARO lenses, so how do you feel with these in your eyes now in terms of vision? Oh, I see great. I have to say, this is the best I have ever had, I mean, to be able to see. I had hard contact lenses when they first came out. I was 16 years old, I remember at the time, and those took a little bit of getting used to. But I had, at the time, they also didn't have the material that they have for lenses now, so I had the big Coke bottle lenses for glasses, and I looked just hideous, and for a 16 year old girl, that was just not going to work. So yeah, so I had regular hard contact lenses for a long time. And then, I think I didn't wear any contact lenses at all for quite a while, I just wore glasses, and I would like every year or two just get my prescription change with my glasses, and then I got soft contact lenses and I did that for a bit. Oh yeah, and in between there, I had cast permeable ones. So I've kind of gone the gamut of whatever there is, but yeah, these are the best. I can really see great out of these.

Before wearing CRT it was, I had to wear contacts in which it was difficult because it was a risk of me like ear falling out or like the a bit bothering me and also sometimes it would get blurry which I had to always have to run to class and before that even I had to wear glasses in which again the risk of you're breaking it or scratching or just or and also playing sports like basketball or baseball hit in your eye.

In the past I would have to wear glasses and it wouldn't be really easy to see so I would have to squint a lot and I always had to change glasses because my eyes would always get worse each year. Yeah your prescription was pretty high do you mind if I share his prescription? Yeah so Aiden's prescription it's around approximately minus six minus four diopters so he has a lot of astigmatism he has more astigmatism than most people have myopia so quite significant and so definitely needed your glasses in order to see right? Yes. Yeah so how's your vision now after wearing Ortho K? Much better. Yeah I'm glad it's neat being able to wake up and see clear yeah? Yes. Perfect perfect okay and you don't have to deal with foggy glasses or anything like that? No. Oh I see yeah so the nicest part waking up and just not having to find your glasses it's like you don't have to put on your eyes in the morning. Yes much easier. I'm glad I'm glad and then from Patty's perspective as a parent I mean did you feel as if we we educated through the whole process that all the gaps were filled and that Aiden was in good control? Right yes from the very beginning when we came in for our initial visit you explained things more than anybody else we we actually went to a lot of different offices but you actually explained the process of Ortho K even though we read a lot before the way you explained it explained gave a lot of more information and it was good that he listened to it and heard it as well from you versus just from his mom and the whole process you work you walk us through you're always available for questions I didn't expect you to respond so quickly like to some of my late texts everyday too but you're always available for our questions so we appreciate that. Thank you yeah we work as a team so we always try to involve our patients because if Aiden's on board then we're ready to rock and roll if he's not on board then we've got some talking to do. I remember we came almost every week for the for the training with the eye so I appreciate your staff's patience they're always upbeat and they're always patient with him and us even though we came week after week and that was like second nature to him but in the beginning it was really tough. Yeah you learn so fast though I mean in the beginning you think about that one instrument that scans your eye you didn't even let us get close to your eye with that instrument so you think of where you started and where you are now and the strides that you made it's really mind-blowing you really went really far really fast so he's had to kind of teach you the ropes and then you pulled yourself up and you now you're doing great so yeah so thank you so much for your testimonial and really appreciate the the dedication you know the Heidi's really on it she's one of those moms where we know that she's every aspect of it she's got it under control and she's taking really good care so she's actually one of our our favorite mom patients that comes in to take care of this because we know she loves her kids so much you can tell um and I wish I had been sooner I just wish I'd been sooner. That's okay the information out there is a little tough to find truthfully because unless you stumble upon myopia management or or the words ortho k it's not as well known as as like let's say orthodontia and so but but yeah it's getting more traction and and the results are there for themselves again Aiden's happy with his vision he's got a huge honking prescription so so thank you so much.

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, it's Eric To from Lumen Optometric, and today I wanted to share with you my tutorial for converting this Honeywell HPA 300 HEPA filter to create a negative pressure environment in your exam rooms. And the reason why I decided to find a way to do this, there weren't any current guides and there's very little talk about negative pressure rooms for private practitioners like ourselves. But, I mean, with the case numbers going up everywhere, and I mean, at Lumen we really employ all the different techniques to keep things healthy. I mean, we disinfect everything, patients are screened at the door, everything is scheduled online, filled in online in terms of our exams. They're even broken up into separate rooms where I interview patients from a separate room from the exam environment, so that room can purify with HEPA filtration. But to me, given the numbers and the state of where we currently are, I don't think it's enough. So hopefully if you find this tutorial helpful, it'll keep your staff and it'll keep yourself and your patients a little healthier. So first, to start, you need the Honeywell HPA 300. This is fairly oversized for a typical exam room. My exam rooms are a little over 80 square feet, so if you're anywhere from 80 to 100, I'm fairly certain that when you kick it into turbo mode, and once you account for all the different leaks in your room, that you should be able to hit the recommended negative 0.01 inches water column. With this one, we definitely hit it in our room. So if your rooms are about the same size, you should be fine there too. So get the unit, make sure it's unplugged. Actually, before you do any of this, make sure it works first. So plug it in, fire it up, and then unplug it. And so what you'll need is a Torx screw set. And so this bit right here is a Torx 15, but it is the security version. So in the very center, there'll be a little divot, and that'll be necessary so that you can actually loosen the screws that were not really intended to be loosened. And so there's six of them. There's one, two, three, which is mirrored on the other side. So some of them are a little tight initially. So good luck on taking those out, and we'll pause for a second, and we'll move to the next step after. Okay, so all the screws are undone at this point, and this is where our goal is to take this thing apart without breaking clips. Luckily, it's not too bad. And once you take all those off, then you can start to pull the bottom half away from the rest of the unit, and all the clips are on the top, this top ring here, and it inserts into this plastic piece here. So as you pull away, if you pull downward, and you sort of push on this area here, too, you can actually see some of the clips. There we go. Even if you break the clips, it's not a huge deal, and it all gets tucked underneath there. But what is important to take out, I'll show you in a second. There we go. It's these little wings on the edge here. You'll be able to see them. Okay, so you pull this thing away, and do be careful. Depending on the surface, this can tip forward. Okay, so this piece you won't need for a while, so you can set it aside. And that's the internals here. So that's the fan. The rest of it, basically, the next step is, there's screws in this area. So these are just two Phillips screw heads. So just remove both of these. Okay, so we'll pause here as well. With those two Phillips head removed, then you can take this top panel off. This one will always stay connected because of the cables here. Mine obviously looks a little different because this was the first version that I had built out just to mess with. And so when you had just one exhaust duct like I had first built it out, I couldn't hit the .01 because there was just too much of an obstruction to airflow. And let's see. So you pop it off pretty much the exact same way. So you've got the little clips that you have to be careful about. Okay, so this goes to the front piece here. And basically what I was doing most of the time in terms of the front piece was just to support it. Usually if I'm doing this at home, it'll tip over if it's on a carpet, but here it's fine. Okay, so now we're getting a closer look at the top grill here. And so you notice this area is cut out. And so this is where the first exhaust vent pulls through here. And so you just have to take a Dremel and cut really nicely through all this one. The tricky part is you have this one card sleeve that's built into the HPA300. Once you have it, you'll see it. And there's a little Phillips head screw. You have to unscrew that so that you can pull out the plastic cards. Otherwise, you still do need to Dremel off this piece. So this is actually going to be my revision 2.0 since I'm adding two exhaust vents instead of one. So what you'll want to do is with your Dremel to continue cutting this whole section off too. So this whole area will be just as bare as this area. It'll be essentially almost mirrored there as well. So get out your Dremel, put on your safety goggles, and watch out for your hands. Put on gloves if you need and cut that whole part out. Since I'm disassembling this one, you'll get a chance to see exactly sort of what the near-end product looks like here. So you have this top cover, this white cover here right next to that surrounds the whole pipe. And that keeps the unit from venting out or exhausting from anywhere other than that vent pipe. And so all that yellow sort of dough looking stuff is actually just gap filler. And so in a few moments, I'll show you what that looks like. All these things were purchased at Home Depot. I mean, the downspout is essentially a rain gutter. Found those from Home Depot too. You usually find that all the way in the back with the raw materials. Fairly, usually an aisle or two away from that is where you find the gap filler as well. So since we're working backwards, let me pop this out here. So here's a close-up of what it looks like on the inside of this vent here. So you can see this vent is basically, in terms of the exhaust, that's the end of the road in terms of how the air would flow. The normal unit, the air exhausts up all the way through this whole space. All the way through here is one whole exhaust vent. So basically, the way that I've set this up here is that this is as far as it goes before venting. And so it wasn't enough. So basically, that's what I've cut out this extra hole for. That's for the secondary version of this to sit in here. So what I'll have to do in a second is I'll show you exactly how I've cut these pipes in order for them to work. This is kind of an overview for you to understand how it works out. Once you kind of get an idea of how it's set up, then you actually can sort of wing it. Anyway, so the expanding foam fills in all the gaps so that the air can't escape past this vent right here. And it's the same on that side too. One of the reasons why I took this thing off is it's actually glued down a little. It's pretty tight. And so that's how that part works. I have the template for this top piece. All you have to do is print it out, tape them together, overlay it on some foam core board, which is what I have here. You'll still have to test fit it. There's a little bit of variance with these units. I found even between my two units. Cut out the holes, and then you'll have to cut out the downspouts You do want to take some preliminary measurements before you start to cut here. This is the first piece that you do want to cut out. This one I would cut out to be around 7 inches. No more than 8 inches. There's a little bit of flexibility, but the problem is once you start getting really tall, this piece, since it's connected and you've cut a hole into it, you won't be able to pull it over too long of a tube. If you keep it to about 7 to 7.5 inches, you'll have enough space here. Cut that 7.5 inch piece of downspout first. In terms of how you want that shape to be cut out, this one I couldn't pull out. It's already glued in there. For the most part, you want it to be open-faced. You'll basically cut that and that's what you can see that I've done essentially here. In terms of the height of that, for me it's about 3.25 inches. You'll know exactly what yours will be because once you cut out these holes from the template and you stick your 7.5 inch piece through that hole and you drop the foam down as far as it'll go for you, then you want to measure from the very front of it, not from the bottom of the filter though because that whole bottom section of the filter here, if you can use an imaginary line, it's sort of curved. If you measure from the bottom, it's not necessarily where the lowest point of that pipe is going to be. The lowest point is actually going to be sitting somewhere here. You could be real fancy and cut it angled if you want, but it really doesn't matter. It's going to be supported only at this point so you do want to measure from the bottom of the pipe, not from the top of the filter. Measure from the bottom of the pipe going on up to this point. For me, you definitely don't want to cut higher than 3.25. The measurement you're looking at is 3.25 for the back piece. In terms of the front piece, it'll be higher than 3.25 because again, that part sort of there's a decline to it. You just stick the other pipe in there and basically what I did was I had the other pipe, which was a whole pipe, stuck it all the way in and then you just this one will actually have to sit about maybe 3-4mm in front of the other one just so that the ridges line up with one another. Set it in so it's comfortable and that it's resting on the decline portion here so it's not going anywhere. That's where it's steady and then draw the line and make sure you cut underneath that line so that you still ensure that seal around here. If these aren't even, it's really not a big deal. You don't have to be very exact because you still have other pipes that are going to sit on top of it later. You'll get your cut length on this one. This one for me was probably around 3.75mm but again, measure yours first. Basically you're just cutting out little stilts just to hold it in place so the air can pass through it but doesn't impede the flow to the pipe that you had already placed in there the first time. This is what I used, the big gap filler this is from Home Depot as well and so you screw on the pipe up there If you have a couple of rooms that you want to do it's advisable to work your way up to this point first because this big gap filler if you let it sit for too long it hardens and usually doesn't allow use over multiple times because everything just dries up here. At this point you've inserted everything in and you have the pipe inserted as well just the back pipe is what we'll start off with and then what you want to do is basically fill exactly where I had filled before. This comes out pretty fast and expands quite a bit so you don't have to lay down too much so fill this gap here that gap back there should be filled too and then fill up this whole gap and that gap down there and once you have that in place you can slide your other piece here and insert it in there and at that point push it down a little bit and you can actually seal off the outer edges there too and you might as well seal off the rest of the edges here too that way it ensures a complete seal Alright so everything is placed in there and it's secured and it's sealed off one thing you can also do is to cut out a second a second cover up sheet from that template so ideally if you had it in black it would be great I had paper lying around so I had a heavier paper stock of white so I cut it out and you just lay it over it doesn't have to sit completely flat for the most part because when you put the grow back on it will obscure the vast majority of all this you just want to cover up some of the ugly cut marks that you had made or if you were neater it might look cleaner than mine but it's not visible from the patient's perspective and we have cut the larger hole by now and you insert it right back over it's going to be a little snug and just make sure everything clips back into place especially these have to definitely go in first so make sure it's almost like a finger in order to to lock in properly there just push it on down and then you just place the front plate back on and screw in those six screws actually before you do the six screws make sure you have the two phillips here and then screw in the six now for reassembly again it's critical to make sure these little nibs go in first so you have the piece of plastic on the inside of the unit and this little wing here it's like a little fork so it does have to insert before the rest of it allows you to click it in place so it's all clipped in there same on the other side then insert all the screws and you're pretty much done with this part at least one other thing that has to be done as well is that the return vents in the rooms have to be closed off so you do have to cover them off otherwise the negative pressure system will just draw air from the return vents so seal them off just like I did for the ceiling tile here and here's the final piece here and so you do have two separate downspouts that sit on top of the ones that we were modifying here and each pipe is individually wrapped with that aluminum duct tape and then I just had one more wrapped around both of them just for aesthetic purposes so you can see they both exhaust up through the ceiling tiles here into the interstitial space and at this point the room is fairly sealed from the interstitial space and you should seal up any other ports behind the walls for me I have video cables running through the walls so all those ports are sealed up so you don't get any air leakage otherwise I think this will keep you as healthy as possible ideally you do want to set this up somewhere between the door and this vent but for most of us optometrists usually right behind the patient is some sort of visual acuity mirror so it doesn't quite work out that way plus the patient has to recline so for me off and to the side worked out a little better so if they're always in constant air flow in the path of air flow then it would work better now verify the negative pressure with a digital pressure gauge or analog it should read negative .01 inches water column do note my tubes are reversed so the reading is positive so good luck and if you have any questions post them down in the comments below and if you find this helpful at all for you then please subscribe and like the video too Thank you for watching\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV_lqzoUekI', 'chunk': 0, 'description': \"Negative Pressure Tutorial for Doctor's Offices\", 'title': \"Negative Pressure Tutorial for Doctor's Offices\"}),\n",

And then tell us what happens when, or what you're feeling when you had your glasses on before, before the Sleros. Before, my vision was real blurry. It was like double or triple. I couldn't focus on anything on my left eye. It was just really hard to see, especially in low lighting. Gotcha. Yeah. So things definitely cleaned up with the Sleros for you then, huh? Oh, definitely. Especially in the left eye, everything's real sharp now. I can see a lot better. I don't feel so strained. Yeah. It's a big difference. Good. Okay. And then what about the whole fitting process? What did you appreciate the most? I love the personability. The way you guys interacted with me. I made sure I was comfortable the whole time.

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, I'm really excited to be able to see your faces again. It's about time to come out of hibernation and we've developed some COVID-19 protocols to make sure that we're being as safe and as healthy as possible for all of the Sierra Madre residents on the surrounding cities. And so I'd like to share some of those ideas with you today. Now those protocols will start even before you come into the office. And so we always have online scheduling that we can assist you with that through text message, emails, phone calls, and we also have required online forms. So when you fill out your forms online, it allows us to spend more direct time with you throughout the whole exam. When you get to the office, we can jump right into the exam instead of waiting for paperwork to be filled out. And three, it minimizes touch points. Now when you get into the office, there's a few things we have to do before you're allowed entry. And the first is that we'll have a COVID questionnaire to make sure that you're feeling healthy and others around you are also still feeling healthy at home. And two, we'll take your temperature with a non-contact thermometer. And three, we'll ensure that you're wearing a mask and we'll also provide hand sanitizer so when you come in, your hands are perfectly clean too. And at that point, we'll jump right into the exam, but the exam does split into two parts. The first part is the case history. Normally I'd spend face-to-face time with a patient during that time, but since we're trying to minimize face-to-face time, that'll be in a different room and it'll be done through a web communication. So I'll be able to see your face, you'll be able to see mine. We'll just talk remotely. And then the second part of the exam resumes as normal. We move into a different room, so we have fresh air. And in that room is when I walk in and I'll check your eyes, I'll make sure you're seeing clearly, wrap up any other concerns, and then our opticians will take you out to the front if you need glasses. And there, they have face shields and they'll be masked as well and all of our instruments have shields built into them to protect my employees and yourself. If you need contacts, everything will just be shipped to you directly. And after you leave, we'll spend about 10 to 15 minutes at disinfect everything. It gives us ample time to clean things and also gives ample time for any aerosolized viral particles to settle. We hope that there won't be any viral particles, but just in case we will have the time for them to settle and the air will be cleaned. We're going to utilize chemical disinfection, UVC, ozone, and have the filtration as well. So we're doing the best that we can to keep everyone safe and healthy. Now, if you have any other suggestions, please share them with us. We're glad to take them in and to integrate them into our systems. And I hope to see you guys really soon. And until then, take care.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6VgVfYl9R0', 'chunk': 0, 'description': 'Our Plan To Keep You Healthy During COVID-19', 'title': 'Our Plan To Keep You Healthy During COVID-19'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey guys! So good morning. Buenos dias. So we woke up early-ish to come back to Isaac's eye doctor because he has another appointment. And if you guys remember we talked about how Isaac has these CRT lenses that are kind of like retainers for your eyeballs so he doesn't have to wear any sort of like eye correctiveness throughout the day. So no contacts, no glasses. And a lot of you guys were actually curious and wanted to learn more about what CRT lenses are because like me in the past, you guys have never heard about these lenses. So we're actually going to be talking to Isaac's eye doctor about them and learning more about what CRT lenses are all about. And also hear from Isaac and see what his experience with them have been. He's still waking up so excuse Isaac for a little bit. You still have your bed head going on. Yeah. Hi doctor! Hello, hey Isaac. How are you? You ready to get those lenses checked? Yeah. Yeah. Alright so this is Dr. Eric Toh here at Lumen Optometric and he's going to be talking to us about this boy's lenses right here. Did it bring out? Yep. Nice. Alright so we got the lenses and we're going to get educated. So this is optically how corneal reshaping or ortho-K lenses work compared to standard lenses. So when we focus here and when I draw this shape, think of this as the cornea. This is the clear window of your eye looking straight up towards the ceiling here. And so when you wear, let's say normal contacts, normal contacts just drape over the eye. They're soft and there's really no, they just conform to the eye essentially. Now when it's corneal reshaping or ortho-K lenses, the lenses have a more unique shape. And so I call it a volcanic shape here. And so you'll see these two humps in this specific area. And so when you sleep in this lens, what happens is that there's a force, there's a negative pressure force. So it's actually a pull force. So it pulls in this direction and it pulls in this direction here. There's no pushing. When you have a lens that pushes, it's unhealthy and some patients do have issues, which we'll talk about later. But when you have a properly designed lens, it's always negative pressure. There's never any push. And so what happens, what's unique about how this works is that in terms of the cornea, the cells will actually migrate to the area of pull and they'll migrate to this area and they'll migrate to this region as well. And then what happens is, is that there's a resultant change in the shape of the cornea. So the cornea actually takes on this slightly volcanic shape as well. So it's a little bit thicker in this region and it's a little bit thicker in this region. And for all of the patients, like for Isaac too, Isaac was myopic, otherwise known as nearsighted. And if any of you folks watching the video are myopic or nearsighted, if you touch your lenses, your glasses lenses, you'll notice it's thicker at the edges compared to the center. And so the way we always designate lenses for patients who are myopic is, it looks like this. It's sort of like a sideways hourglass. But you can tell it's thicker on the edge here and thicker here. And optically, that's how it cancels out the prescription. So essentially what we're doing is we're building that correction into the eye. That's what allows Isaac to see clear every morning once he takes the lenses out and he sees clear for the rest of the day. Yeah. So I actually had a DM from one of you guys asking me whether or not Dr. Toe has discussed with us the negative side effects that could potentially happen. Because there was someone in my DMs who told me about her experience, how she had CRT lenses growing up throughout her childhood. But then when she entered her adulthood, she was notified that those lenses ended up like eating down her cornea. So she ended up having a negative experience with CRT lenses. So what are some thoughts that you might have as to why that might have happened to her? And is this an actual effect that can happen to anyone? Like to Isaac, for example? Like will we find out later when he's an adult that his cornea is depleted? When it comes to this question, it goes back to how you design the lenses with the software and also how you monitor your patients as well. So if we go back to a really quick whiteboard, when you consider how the lenses are shaped again, right? So really exaggerated here. Again, you're creating negative pressure here and negative pressure here. And the cornea pretty much sits right underneath it. The thing is, is that these lenses, there's always a cushion of tears. Okay, there's never a point where the lens or there's never a point where the lens is supposed to actually touch the eye. Because if the back surface of that lens touches the front surface of your cornea, you'll definitely have an abrasion. And so most likely that's probably what happened. For some of our patients, we always, or for all of our patients, we always monitor how their eyes are doing by looking in. And I have Isaac come back quarterly to make sure everything's healthy. I think even for Tiffany, she didn't, she wasn't aware of OrthoK CRT until somebody else had told her about it. And so a lot of patients aren't aware of it. And there's a lot of potential for keeping eyes healthy with it. I mean, this isn't the only way to keep eyes healthy. Whenever we have a patient, we always fight to make sure that they're healthy and that they love the experience because most parents don't know. And so when somebody performs OrthoK improperly, then that type of news spreads. And it does, it does kids, kids like Isaac a disservice. It does future kids whose parents who find that one, I mean, for every thousand kids who are happy, there might be one child who saw a provider that wasn't taking very good care. And, and the news of that one tends to spread like wildfire. Yeah. And so, um, I always fight to make sure our kids are, are taking, have their eyes well taken care of so that their, their eyes are healthy and that future kids don't, don't find this, this, this news and their parents don't tend to ruminate on it. Yeah, that's true. Because we actually heard from Isaac's dentist about his daughter doing CRT lenses. And we were like, what is this? Cause Isaac had already been tired of using contact or no, not contacts. He had been tired of using glasses. He was interested in getting contacts. But then once his dentist brought this up, we were like, Oh, that sounds way better. You have to wear contacts throughout the days, only at night. We started treatment back in April. So it's already been more than a whole year that you've been doing this. Honestly, it feels nice. I remember when I was little and I had clear vision. I remember one day I looked into the projector at school. And that's when it started getting blurry. It's pretty nice to have that same experience, but older and getting to see a road name from far away without wearing anything on my face. Yeah. But like when you were really little and you had clear vision, huh? Yeah. So it's really nice. The lenses I have now is very comfortable. That you have now, the lenses that you have now are very comfortable. Because I can't really feel them sometimes. So yeah, it's like my regular eye. I know in the beginning when we first started this treatment, you were having some issues with the comfortableness, comfortability of your lenses. Yeah, comfort. Yeah. Yeah, I think for Isaac, I mean, you were seeing clear even though it was a little uncomfortable in the beginning, though, from what I recall. And so optically, he was well protected. But some of our patients, their eyes are a little more sensitive. So I just have to alter the fit. I mean, when you're taking a custom scan, you're taking a custom scan of essentially, it's a soft, soft tissue. Yeah. And so there's assumptions that are made there. And for some patients, the assumptions are really spot on. Sometimes they're a little bit more off, they're a little off. And so we just have to accommodate for it. And so once once we're aware of the issue, then we correct it. And now we're good. Yeah. And another thing that really sold me for CRT lenses was when we first came in, Dr. To is telling us about how over time, that these types of lenses end up maintaining the health of Isaac's eyeballs over time, your eyes end up getting elongated, because those lenses are over correcting your eyes. So which means like, throughout time, your vision is technically getting worse, right? Normally, yeah, normally, normally, if we hadn't done anything, and if Isaac were just continue with normal glasses or contacts, his eyes would have kept growing. Yeah. And every time it's it grows, it actually gets less healthy. Yeah, because the there's the there's a light, think of the eye as a camera, there's essentially, it's almost like film on the inside, it's the retina. And that is the same size as your eyes growing. The problem is, as your eye grows, that retina has to stretch. And so it doesn't like being stretched. Alright, so we got to learn a lot from Dr. To about CRT lenses, and myopia management. And if you guys are interested in checking out Dr. To, you can check out the website down in the description below lumenoptometric.com. And if you're not local to LA, you can also check out his website. And then there's also references or resources there where you guys can find an eye doctor closest to you. So thank you so much, Dr. To for having us appreciate the educational lesson. And we'll be coming back for Isaac's checkups. All right, now we're gonna go home and play some video games. Yeah, right. Spend some time outside, right? Rest those eyes. We'll ride on my ripstick. Yeah, we'll ride on his ripstick. He tried teaching me the other day and it was a fail. But you can try teaching me again. Yeah. Maybe. I could ride to the mailbox. Yes. Yeah, away from video games, right? That's right. Yeah, yeah. More time outside, less time indoors.

So I just forget my glasses and then I can't see for class No, so it's great being able to just wake up and go about my day And then what about the benefits or what can you do now that you couldn't do before or was more difficult for you to do Before it was definitely more difficult for me to play sports, you know wearing glasses while playing volleyball is not ideal I think it's smacked in the face So it was very nice to not have to worry about that for studying and worry about headaches wearing glasses Staring at my computer for however long baking even so my glasses don't fall into the batter. That's great Yeah Yeah, that's wonderful You think about the the other benefit to the one of the really important benefits is the the fact that your prescription hasn't changed much since we've met and It's stable your eyes in a much healthier place So for for our parents or for our other potential young patients who are thinking about CRT What do you think thumbs up or thumbs down?

She's been willing to help us out with this video testimonial of her SLARO lenses. So Cindy, when you first came in, what was going on with your current contacts and your issues that you're experiencing? Well, I had ongoing issues with my rigid cast permeable lenses, fogging up, just not clear, needing to take them out several times a day to clean them, to try to see better and I thought, gee, got to do something about this. So I called up the practice and was told that I probably would be a good candidate to look into the SLARO lenses and so I did. Oh, that's great. I remember when you first came in, you had mentioned that you were cleaning them, I think you had almost mentioned once every like 15, 20 minutes or something like that. Yes. Yeah. So it was impacting my lifestyle. I mean, I was nervous to go out because I was always afraid the lenses would fog up while I was driving and having to carry cleaning solution, take them out of public restrooms, clean them, all of that. So, yeah. Super, super comfortable. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So at this point, Cindy's wearing the S-MAP created lenses and so the S-MAP creates a custom scan of the whole frontal aspect of the eye and we create a SLARO lens off of that and I coin these as SLARO 2.0 lenses. So how do they feel? They feel wonderful. I don't even realize they're on my eye. Very, very comfortable. Yeah. It's good to know. And then your prescription is extremely high, so what would you say in terms of stability of your vision? Does it fluctuate like it did with gas permeable lenses? Oh, very stable. So much better. Just put them in in the morning and they stay in all day. Last thing to come out at night and it's been fabulous. Just to kind of get my life back to know I could see clearly all day. All right.

       " Document(page_content=\"We have Nikki here, and Nikki's helping us with an Ortho-K testimonial. And so, the first question I always ask, what was your vision like before Ortho-K? Before Ortho-K, I used regular soft-faced lenses or just daily lenses that I used to wear. They were extremely dry. I used to just have different eyedrops with me no matter where I went. Whether I was working long shifts at my work or if I was in a room where the fan or the air conditioning was on me, they would constantly dry out to the point where I was blinking and they would just fall out. So, eyedrops were essential and it just became tedious and it just became uncomfortable. So, coming here and finding a whole new, brand new type of solution was extremely nice. And I'm extremely grateful for Dr. To and everything that he's done for me. So, before, do not recommend this new method. I highly recommend and I'm so happy that I made the change. Glad. Yeah, I know with dry eyes, it's definitely not comfortable, especially when it comes to soft contacts. So, what's your vision like now? My vision now is absolutely amazing. I'm really obsessed with it and extremely grateful for everything that the doctor and this business has done for me and that these new contacts have done for me. My vision now, I feel like I'm looking in HD. I'm viewing in 4K. I don't have any blurriness. I wear them for one night when I wake up and I can see everything. I'm usually nearsighted. So, like before I had problems seeing faces far away, reading signs far away. So, driving is fantastic now, like recognizing faces and seeing people, going to work, being able to view and see everything in clear, perfect vision is so nice and I really love it. Yeah, it was exciting for you, especially that day when you came in for the dispense and we placed it in your eye and then by the time we took it off, it wasn't even on for that long. Yes, yeah. When we tried on the lens, we did a couple of tests for like a couple of minutes and then I took them off and I only put them on for like 10 minutes and I was able to see it already. I was so excited to be able to sleep in them and then be able to live my life and live my entire day after all of that. So, very seamless process and yeah, dry eyes are not a problem anymore. I don't have to carry on my liquid eye drops or anything. So, very happy and I just feel like a normal person that can wake up and start my day and not have to worry about one more thing that I have to do. That's wonderful. How about the whole process? Do you feel like we held your hand through the whole thing, that we taught you everything you needed to know? Yeah, coming into this office, a couple of things like setting an appointment is extremely easy. Coming in, they make time for each individual patient. So, when you're here, their full attention is on you. You don't have to wait in a waiting room for 15, 20, 30 minutes. When it's your appointment time, they make that time just for you because they space them out. They give you their full attention. They're really good with doing recurrent and bringing you back every couple of weeks, every two weeks, checking in on you. Additionally, Dr. To will always text you and ask you how you're doing. He'll send you emails regularly. He's very hands-on, makes you very comfortable and really great experience here. I'm really glad that I found this place. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you for my great vision. Oh, you're welcome. Yeah, we love taking care of you and your family too and Nikki's mom wears Ortho-K too. Yes, my mom first came here, lived super close, was looking for a new eye doctor. Not only did we find a great eye doctor, but we found new types of lenses that have changed our whole families like my mom's. It also means I'm really glad that my mom found the space and then recommended me as a family member. Thank you so much for your testimony. It really means a lot. We love seeing you here. We love seeing you every single time you come in. And so it really means a lot that they trust us with your vision care. Thank you. Thank you so much for great vision.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psh8iOBhjTM', 'chunk': 0, 'description': 'Testimonial Ortho-K Orthokeratology Myopia Management', 'title': 'Ortho-K Is The Best Option For Niki And Fam'}),\n",

So, what were your eyes like day to day before you started wearing neurolenses? Tired. I would tear up quite often, very itchy, and I was constantly conscious that I needed to rub them because they were either too dry or itchy. And then also, in terms of how your head felt, do you remember where most of your headaches would occur? Yes, I would get headaches several times during the week, starting from the temple and sometimes going to the back of my neck. So you're definitely on the computer quite a bit, huh? Yes, from very early hours in the morning at work and then still come home and be on my computer to take care of things at home too. I know what that feels like. That's very painful all day long. So your symptoms now, how are they feeling? Much better. I feel a big difference on my eye. My vision doesn't get tired. I don't get teary anymore at the end of the day. I feel that I don't have that much strain in my eyes. So I'm not as tired when I get home and still have to be on the computer for another couple of hours. So I really am loving my glasses. I'm glad. I'm glad. Yeah, they look wonderful on you too. And so if you had any other friends or family with the same type of symptoms, would you recommend your own lenses again today? Without a doubt. I would personally walk them in too if I could, and if I can't, I will. Yeah, okay. I appreciate it. So I'm really glad that they're working out for you.

And so, if you remember, when you came in, you actually had a pretty high prescription. Yeah. Yeah. And then your parents were really on the ball about keeping your prescription low. And so, two years later, here we are. Yeah. So, do you remember the very first night when you woke up after having slept in the lenses? What was your vision like? Yeah. It was good, and then I forgot that I, like, it felt like I had glasses on, and I forgot about it. And I kept, like, trying to touch my face, but they weren't there. Yeah. It's such an interesting experience when you wake up and you're used to seeing blurry until you find your glasses. Yeah. Now you just wake up and you see clear, right? Yeah. You play a lot of sports, and you're in good shape, right? Yeah. When I was playing soccer, my, like, my goggles would get in the way, and, like, say the ball hit me, it would hurt. But then after that, it's, like, I didn't have to use them anymore, so it wasn't really a problem anymore. And then for swimming, too, when I had my goggles on, I couldn't see, like, where to go, like, the clock. Yeah. So, that helped with the doing laps, too. It's always fun watching you guys grow every single year, but just seeing after when you get a chance to take off your glasses and just being free, it's nice seeing your confidence level shoot up, too.

       " Document(page_content=\"Now we have Edith, we have Sahara, we have Hector, and both Sahara and Hector wear Ortho-K for myopia progression to slow it down. And so the first thing I'd like to ask is how was your vision before you started? It's been pretty well. I've seen really clear than I have ever been before. Gotcha. What about you? Yeah, before my vision was super, super bad, especially growing up with astigmatism. It was always a challenge and I've always had glasses since I can remember. So now it's a very new experience, but it's a good progression that I'm excited to see, that I can just see in general, and that I don't have to use glasses no longer. Yeah, it's nice though. I know a lot of folks who have clear vision sort of take it for granted, but I mean, both of you have fairly high prescription. So going from so blurry, being able now to see 20-20 is a pretty big difference when you wake up, right? You don't have to retrace your glasses anymore. Yeah, yeah. So I'm glad. Perfect. And then what I'd like to ask the parents too, from your perspective, do you feel as if we took good care of your children to make sure that they were seen clear and their eyes were healthy? Definitely. It was very exciting for me to know about the way how they can progress their vision. And once we started with my son and then later on with Sahara, I can see in both of them the progress and the hassle not to be looking for glasses and spending so much in frames and all this stuff. So it is a very, very good system in how to correct the vision. It's very exciting to see how this fast they were able to get rid of the glasses. Yeah, that's great. And then any tips for any future parents looking into myopia management? I will say they should search for this option instead of having the glasses, especially when the kids are very active, like Hector, he was very active. It was very a hassle to see how to help him not to fall with his glasses on and stuff like that. So I will say I would recommend to the parents definitely to go by this option. It's way better than the lenses. Yeah, I'm glad you're doing well. Again, the girls are a family that we see fairly regularly. It's always nice to see your faces in here. Yeah. All right.

Before I had scleral lenses, um, I had, I had gas permeable lenses and they were so uncomfortable and it always felt like I had glass in my eyes. It felt like, um, my eyes were super dry all the time. I travel often, so I needed something that was comfortable and that I was able to wear for long periods of time. Due to my condition, my condition in both of my eyes, I'm not able to wear glasses and see perfectly. So it was kind of mandatory for me to have contacts in order for me to see, um, exceptionally well. Right. Um, the process itself, it was so easy and the receptionist, everyone in Lumen Optometry, they were just answering all my questions that were so, um, flexible with their schedule. As I said earlier, I travel often, so I needed something, I needed a lot of time, um, to, first of all, I live in Marina Del Rey, so I needed a lot of time, um, to get there and they were just all very flexible with, um, their schedules. The other thing I wanted to say is that, um, the scleral lenses are so comfortable. It's so comfortable. Like, you don't even feel that they are. And I was really afraid because of the size of the scleral lenses, I never had anything, you know, that big, um, you know, in my eyes, so I wanted to make sure that it was, um, that it was going to be comfortable and it was. And Dr. Tove, um, definitely made sure that it was before I went home. Um, he, he, him and his receptionist made sure that I knew how to take off the lenses because it's a completely different process, um, than the gas permeable lenses that I had before and they made sure that I knew how to put them on by myself before I went home. So that process itself was, um, very thorough and I appreciate that they could, they were concerned about my health when it comes to that. Um, other than that, like I had an overall great experience. I recommend it to anyone moving forward. I definitely recommend it to my friends and family. Um, they were so easy to work with and they were really, really so happy to answer any of my questions. So thank you. Thank you so much, Dr. Tove and Lumen Optometry. You guys are getting like definitely a five-star review in Yelp and anywhere else where I can find you guys.

       " Document(page_content=\"In this video, we'll go over myopia management decision making and some of the flow charts can be for fairly complicated and the tree-all size has one, but I think we like to, I've got it fairly simple, a simplified thing. And so we'll start with atropine here. Okay. So atropine we order from OSRX and it's at .025 and .05 are the percentages that they offer. You can also prescribe 1% if needed with progresses, with transitions. If we know that both parents have a super high prescription and the kid is progressing at a young age, okay, and their axial lengths are larger than they're supposed to be. The no need to worry about it. Doctors have used it for a long period of time. There's a lot more doctors who are scared about using, above never use it, that have opinions about it, but the doctors that have used 1%. Don't worry about it so much. It just works, right? And so atropine I typically say for children under six years old or as a combination treatment. Usually I tend to have there be more little boys on atropine as opposed to little girls because when it comes to little girls they tend to be a little bit more mature and the other options are more available to them. Okay. So these are the percentages we never prescribe .01 and then otherwise as combination treatment, we just consider a complex treatment with ortho-k or with soft multifocals if their axial length progression is greater than about maybe .2 millimeters per year, right? Anyone from .1.15, the truth is pretty normal, I sometimes you get .1 to .15, this is probably a upper limit. You shouldn't really be going above .2. And then the next is soft multifocal contact lenses and I as a breed them, abbreviated SMFCLs. And this is for low myopia. The reason why we mentioned low myopia is because when you're creating an ortho-k and you're asked why my why low myopia for this versus why not just fit them in ortho-k, you're trying to create a certain amount of plus in the pupil. And the thing is is that when you're trying to displace the tissue central, you're trying to displace the central tissue to the paressential area, the red ring, when the prescription is not that low there's actually not that much tissue displacement. So it's a little tough creating all that much plus in the pupil. Most doctors do mention that they still have done it, but I still like to play it safe. I don't, when it comes to wave, you can sort of calculate how much plus you're going to anticipate putting in the pupil and when it comes to low myopia designs, the numbers don't pan out. So I'd still prefer for the young prescriptions for the young kids to wear the soft multifocal and then when they do, I mean ultimately they'll still progress a little bit once they get into the .1.50s or so .1.25, .1.50, then you can switch them over to ortho-k. It's also a great option for parents who are hesitant about ortho-k. Some parents definitely do see the benefits and some patients, even though it's FDA- approved, they get a little bit nervous about sleeping in lenses, even though you explain to them exactly that you're only sleeping in the lenses, you're not, you're not supposed to sleep in normal soft contacts because typically if you're sleeping in them, that meant that you've been wearing them all day long. And that's not the case with ortho-k, but it works well as a bridge. And so again, soft multifocal scan also be used with atropane as well. If actually like there's not under good control. Normally I would start with natural view one day multifocal, unless the parent comes to a specifically mentioning my site one day. The main difference is that the my site one day, since they're the only ones that have the FDA approval for a soft contact, they actually charge a lot more for it. And the natural view tends to work better. It has higher parameters if it's needed and the amount of plus up that's generated out in the periphery is actually quite high. And this pans out even, you can tell for adults to, the adults tend to do a bit better when it comes to the natural view types of designs. As opposed to the standard, Coopervision, Biophinity, Proclear types of multifocal, right? And so for the kids, they get the same amount of higher plus out in the periphery. And then when it comes to ortho-k, well that's a typo. That's for greater than one doctor in myopia. So you're at 125-150 or so. Yeah, if both eyes are 125, then I'll still suggest it or one eye's one, the other ones 150, then I'll still consider ortho-k's. At that point, it's just simpler. Or if they have more cylinder than that, okay. When we design it custom, we can actually knock out vast majority of the sill. Very rare. Do I recall having patients still have sill present? Even if a patient's up to four to three. right that we're the sill typically normally knocks down about half or so when it's customary does take care of it because of our g-sem designs most most standard Non-custom lenses are r-sem unless you go with something like dual-axis or whatnot And so even then the g-sem are more complicated than dual-axis lenses and then ortho care works better for patients who or parents have had lacic for their kids They understand it's almost like a form of lacic, but it's protective and so When it comes to all the treatments, that's basically what we have here and I think it'll get more complicated as we have more treatment options available to us as Spectacle lenses come out, but right now it's basically I imagine really young kids and then kind of in between This is for the best majority of the kids that we're going to meet it definitely has more of the appeal because they can see clear without having to wear glasses, right? And so or alternatively both of these are either one of these combined with that chipping\", metadata={'source': 'Doc_MyopiaDesignMaking.wav', 'title': 'Myopia Management Decision Making', 'description': 'Myopia Management Decision Making'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR, STABLE, AND COMFORTABLE vision is no longer out of reach. The future is here and the answer lies with scleral lenses. WILL I SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCLERAL AND SOFT LENSES? Scleral lenses are built from highly- customizable, firm lens materials, which offer clearer vision relative to the standard soft lenses. Example: consider how vision is better through a window versus clear, flexible plastic sheeting. CAN SCLERALS BE WORN THE WHOLE DAY? They can be worn for the full course of the day. Some patients may need to remove and clean the lenses mid day to maintain the best possible comfort and vision. WILL THEY HELP WITH MY DRY EYES? The moisture chamber under the scleral lens will greatly diminish dryness, leading to much more comfortable vision. HOW LONG DOES A SCLERAL LENS LAST? A set of scleral lenses should be replaced every 18- 24 months to maintain healthy vision, comfort, and to avoid lens warpage.ARE SCLERAL LENSES COMFORTABLE? Yes! The lenses are larger so they rest gently on the sclera and the edges are tucked under the eyelid. A well-fitting scleral lens is just as comfortable and less dry than soft contacts. SCLERAL LENSES DONE RIGHT AT LUMEN OPTOMETRIC! First, we start with a topographical scan of the cornea, which allows us to capture the curvature of your eye. We then customize the scleral lens for each individual eye, factoring in the prescription, all while ensuring that the lens rests gently and comfortably on the sclera. Once the lens is designed, we confirm that we’ve met both your visual and comfort demands. Our scleral lens fitting is not complete until you are completely pleased with the results. TO GET STARTED, SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH US AT WWW.LUMENOPTOMETRIC.COM FOR A COMPLIMENTARY CONSULTATION WHERE WE’LL EXPLAIN THE SCLERAL FITTING PROCESS IN MORE DETAIL.WHAT ARE SCLERAL LENSES? Scleral lenses are large diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (clear window of the eye) and gently settle on the sclera (white covering of the eye).WHAT ARE THEIR ADVANTAGES? Clear, stable vision due to the rigid lens design. Increased comfort from the lens resting on the less-sensitive sclera. Decreased dry eye from all- day lubrication of the cornea. WHO CAN HELP? Patients with keratoconus, pellucid, post-surgical glare/blur, compromised corneal integrity (dry eyes, recurrent erosions), high prescriptions, & exacting visual demands (photography, videography, sports).', metadata={'source': 'https://www.lumenoptometric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intro_ScleralLenses.pdf', 'title': 'SCLERAL LENSES CLEAR & COMFORTABLE VISION WITHOUT COMPROMISE vision is no longer out of reach', 'description': 'SCLERAL LENSES FAQ answers to common questions on scleral lenses'})]"

Candidacy Our Technology Frequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens Exams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID 19 Protocols Videos About Us Office Testimonials Blog 3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked Blog AMD Awareness Month 3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked February 3, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Age related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in adults aged 50 and older. Given its complexity, it’s essential to understand the facts about the condition rather than believing the common myths often shared online or by friends and family. Knowing more about AMD can help you take steps to prevent or delay its progression, so here are statements you can overlook to maintain your vision for years to come. Myth #1: AMD Is a Disease That Only Affects Older Adults AMD is an eye condition caused by deterioration in part of the retina, called the macula. This area at the back of your eye helps you see things with sharp detail and color when looking straight ahead for example, when reading or driving a car but it does not affect peripheral vision like looking out into the distance around you. While researchers are still working to understand what causes this macular degeneration, it’s likely due to age combined with other risk factors such as smoking, obesity and genetics. Who is at risk of AMD? People over age 50 have an increased risk of developing early stages of this condition; however, younger people may also be diagnosed if they have certain genetic mutations associated with these conditions. Myth #2: There Is No Cure for AMD Though there currently isn’t a cure for late stage AMD, treatments are available depending on which type has been diagnosed. Dry AMD has no treatment yet, but recent studies indicate that some dietary changes may slow its progression. Lifestyle changes that can help include eating leafy green vegetables rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, as well as omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oil might reduce inflammation throughout your body, including within your eyes. Similarly, maintaining good overall health by exercising regularly, eating healthy foods, quitting smoking and protecting yourself from UV light will help lower ocular inflammation. Myth #3 All Vision Loss From MDM Is Irreversible Treatments such as intravitreal injections of anti vascular endothelial growth factor medications and photodynamic therapy can help improve vision in some cases. Other treatments such as laser therapy, vitrectomy, cataract surgery and low vision aids can also help reduce AMD’s effects. Early diagnosis and management are key to preserving your sight longer with AMD. Time to Get Checked If you are over 50 or have any other risk factors for developing AMD, you should get an eye exam with your doctor. If you live in the Sierra Madre area, Lumen Optometric can provide comprehensive eye exams to help detect AMD early and offer recommendations for treatment and management. We also provide other ophthalmologic services and products, such as contact lenses and orthokeratology. Call us today at to schedule an appointment.

That’s why millions of people wear these lenses for several hours on a daily basis. However, despite being a common device used to correct vision, it’s not unusual for some contact lens wearers to forget a thing or two about contact lens safety. Generally, contact lenses are safe when they are worn responsibly and cared for properly. Whether you are new to wearing contacts or you have been a long time contact lens wearer, make sure that you follow these 10 important rules listed by neurons treatment expert Lumen Optometric. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses. Closing your eyes while wearing your lenses reduces oxygen and makes the surface of your eye more vulnerable to infection.Don’t wear your contacts when you are in the shower, swimming pool, ocean, or hot tub. Tap water, seawater, and the water from lakes, rivers, and pools harbor organisms that can cause an eye infection.Have your contact lenses fitted by a qualified eye care professional. And make sure to follow their instruction on when to replace your contacts. Using lenses for longer than the manufacturer’s recommendation will increase your risk for eye infection as protein buildup could occur. If you are also using dry eye treatment, ask your doctor about precautions on wearing contacts, if any.Always use fresh contact lens solutions every time you store your contact lenses in their case. Never reuse solution or top off old solution since the disinfecting ability of the old solution is already gone.Never use saline water for disinfecting or cleaning your contact lenses. Saline solution is just sterile saltwater, so it has no ability to clean or disinfect contacts.Wash your hands with soap and water before touching your contact lenses. Make sure to completely rinse and dry your hands.Clean your contact lens case using a multipurpose contact lens solution. Let it dry during the day and make sure to replace it every month.Check your contact lenses for tears or chips. Although these lenses are soft, a tear or a chip can still scratch your eye. It’s best to discard your lenses if they have been damaged.Discard your lenses if they land on the floor or in the sink.If you are using reusable lenses, make sure to rub the lenses with a multipurpose contact lens solution. This will help remove debris or protein buildup. Lumen Optometric Need to consult a scleral optometrist? Visit Lumen Optometric to get excellent and personalized eye care services.

The obvious benefits of fresh air and physical exercise aren’t the only perks for kids who play outdoors. Recent research shows that increased “sun time” can actually slow down the progression of myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), or even postpone its onset! But First, What Is Myopia and Why Is It Harmful? Myopia is an eye disease that causes the eye to elongate more than it should, resulting in blurry distance vision. It’s caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, two of which are not spending enough time outdoors and doing excessive near work like device use. Many parents aren’t aware that childhood myopia significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration later in life. It’s been shown that higher myopia is associated with a greater risk of eye disease. That’s why it’s important to stop myopia in its tracks with myopia management. 3 Reasons Why Outdoor Play Benefits Your Child’s Eyes Whether your child is currently nearsighted or not, spending time outdoors in the sunshine can help delay the onset of myopia or slow its progression. 1\\\\. The Brightness of the Sun The sun’s visible light is significantly brighter than the lighting in almost any indoor setting, which may play a major role in controlling myopia. Studies have shown that when sunlight comes in contact with the retina, it causes the release of dopamine into the eye. This may prevent the eye from elongating. Preventing the eye from growing too long is the main goal of myopia management. What is certain: children who spend at least 2 3 hours playing outdoors in the sunshine progress less rapidly than children who spend almost all their time indoors. 2\\\\. Long Distance Focusing It is well established that prolonged near activities like reading and screen time contribute to myopia onset and progression. It’s no surprise that studies now show COVID 19 confinement may have caused higher rates of myopia in children as well. Spending time outdoors, on the other hand, encourages your child to focus on distant objects like trees, basketball hoops, a ball flying through the air anything that’s more than an arm’s length away. 3\\\\. Vitamin D Vitamin D helps smooth muscle tissue around the eye’s crystalline lens allowing it to function properly. This smooth muscle helps focus light on the retina, and may also help maintain the proper eye shape and length between the lens and the retina, which can become distorted as a child’s eyes grow with every passing year. Moreover, the sun’s invisible UVB light triggers Vitamin D production. Some studies have found that nearsighted individuals have lower levels of Vitamin D than those with normal vision. However, more research is needed to solidify this claim, as only small scale studies have been performed. The recommended time for daily outdoor play is at least 2 hours for children over the age of 6. Be sure to send your child outside with a water bottle, sun hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to battle childhood myopia and preserve children’s eye health for the long term.

The more you know about workplace eye safety, the better you can protect your eyes and the longer you can enjoy clearer and healthier vision. Lumen Optometric, the area’s leading specialist in corneal reshaping and other eye care services, shares some of the things you can do to protect your eyes in the workplace. 1\\\\. Wear the necessary eye protection. Those whose career is in construction work, engineering and landscaping tend to be more at risk of eye related injuries. If you belong to any of these fields, make sure that you always wear the applicable eye protection. Doing so not only keeps you safe but also ensures you’ll be able to carry out your tasks in a more efficient manner. 2\\\\. Reduce exposure to blue light. People working in construction, engineering, and other physically demanding jobs run the risk of developing eye problems, but this doesn’t mean those working in the office aren’t exempt. Staring in front of a computer screen can make office employees more prone to digital eye strain. Its symptoms may include headaches, fatigue, dry and watery eyes, and blurred vision. If you’re experiencing these yourself, schedule a consultation with a premier eye exam doctor like Lumen Optometric promptly. You can also take steps to lower your eyes’ exposure to blue light. Using an anti glare screen on your computer can help. You may also adjust screen brightness or position the monitor in such a way that it’s not directly facing a bright light source. 3\\\\. Follow the 20 20 20 rule. For every 20 minutes of screentime, take a 20 second break and look at an object 20 feet away. You don’t even need to stay seated as you do this. How about taking a quick stroll around the workplace to give your eyes a much needed rest?

By limiting your child’s screen time, you help your child to experience the many benefits. As a parent, you should be mindful of how much time your child spends on devices. You might be wondering, how can a parent help in preventing eye diseases in their children? Well, it all starts with limiting screen time. Here are several ways for you to do just that. Set Expectations The first step to limiting your child’s screen time is to let them know what you expect. Set clear expectations early on, explaining why you are limiting their screen time and why it’s important for them to spend more time playing outside or reading books. If they have concerns or questions about limiting their screen time, listen and address them before setting the limit so that they understand why it is important to follow these rules. You can even make a deal with your child: if they spend 30 minutes doing something other than using screens, then they can watch TV or play video games for 30 minutes afterward (or whatever works best). However, don’t give in to demands be consistent! Set a Timer Setting a timer is an effective way to limit your child’s screen time. Not only will it remind them when their allotted time is up, but it can also help them keep track of how much time they’ve spent on various activities as well. You can choose from several apps that are available for download onto your smartphone; or if you prefer, there are physical timers out there as well (like ones with bells). If using an app, simply select the length of time that you want your child to spend looking at screens and set the alarm accordingly. Once this is done, you can set up notifications to alert you every hour so that if anything goes wrong or if any inappropriate material is being viewed you’ll know about it right away. Create a “Tech Free” Zone in Your Home You can create a “tech free” zone in your home by choosing a room or space that is free of all screens and then putting them there. This could be your child’s bedroom, or it could be a quiet spot in the house where you can enjoy each other’s company without distractions. This will allow everyone to relax and disconnect from technology while they’re at home, which may help prevent screen time overload and overstimulation when using technology later on. Lead by Example The most effective way to control your child’s screen time is by monitoring your own usage as well. While it is important to set limits for your child, you need to be aware of how much time you are spending in front of a screen as well. Children will often mimic their parents, so if you want them to cut back on their own screen time, then it’s best for parents to do the same thing first. Choose Treehouse Eyes For Better Vision It’s important for your child to develop social skills and human interaction. You can’t do this if they’re glued to their screens. It also helps them learn how to manage their distractions, which is an important life skill that will help them get through things like school and work.

To ensure that your child can do well in class, you will need to manage their refractive error. This usually means going to a trusted local eye doctor for prescription eyeglasses. But not every child wants to wear eyeglasses, especially those who are active in sports and other physical activities. This makes contact lenses a more attractive option, but is your child actually ready for them? Lumen Optometric, the leading eyecare provider in the area, shares how you can know. 1\\\\. Your child is asking if they can wear them. The decision to wear contact lenses will depend on the child. If wearing eyeglasses makes them unhappy and uncomfortable, then they will be far more motivated to take good care of their contact lenses. 2\\\\. They make an effort to be clean and hygienic. Proper use and care of contact lenses is a big responsibility. Cleanliness should always be observed to ensure safety and comfort and to prevent infections and other eye problems. If your child knows the importance of cleanliness and makes an effort to practice good hygiene, then they should be ready to wear contacts. 3\\\\. Your child does their chores without being asked repeatedly. A certain amount of discipline is required on the part of the child when it comes to contact lens use. The proper cleaning and storage of contact lenses are akin to doing household chores.

One of these problems is diabetic eye disease, which can severely damage your vision. Diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the conditions that result from this disease. Fortunately, Lumen Optometric is here to share four steps you can take to prevent or slow down diabetic eye disease. 1\\\\. Undergo a Dilated Eye Exam Annually Diabetic patients are highly advised to visit a dilated eye exam doctor at least once a year. In this assessment, your ophthalmologist will identify early signs that diabetes is affecting your eyesight. Typically, diabetic eye diseases only show a few symptoms until the condition has advanced. If your vision starts to blur due to diabetes, consult a professional immediately to determine the best treatment for you and save you from irreversible vision loss. 2\\\\. Manage Your Blood Sugar Keep your blood sugar level in your target range by eating food that is low in sugar and carbohydrates, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood sugar. For personalized assistance, consult a primary care physician, an endocrinologist or a nutritionist. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor. 3\\\\. Control Your Blood Pressure Managing blood pressure can protect your eyes from diabetic retinopathy, which is a complication of diabetes that damages the retina. If your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are high, your tiny fragile blood vessels would react negatively, resulting in serious eye damage. In the event that your eye condition has worsened, call your eye doctor right away for corneal reshaping or other treatments. 4\\\\. Maintain an Active and Healthy Lifestyle A balanced diet and regular exercise can help control your diabetes, which can benefit your eye health. As much as possible, avoid consuming processed and fried food, an excessive amount of red meat, high sugar beverages, and food with refined carbohydrates. For a hassle free mealtime, you can ask your diabetic care team to create a meal plan that works for you and provides you with enough energy to maintain an active lifestyle. For outstanding diabetic eye care, you can rely on us at Lumen Optometric. We provide comprehensive eye examinations, contact lenses and other optical solutions.

Besides giving you the ability to see, they let you learn new skills and interact with others. Taking good care of your eyes goes a long way in maintaining good vision and avoiding sight threatening conditions. A local orthokeratology specialist gives five tips to keep your eyes healthy. 1\\\\. Schedule Regular Eye Exams Routine comprehensive eye exams help diagnose various eye conditions in their early stages, including glaucoma, cataracts and age related eye conditions. Sometimes, they also allow specialists to catch signs of other health problems, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. How often you need to get your eyes checked typically depends on your age and family history of eye disease. You may need to visit an eye exam doctor more frequently if you have an existing medical condition. 2\\\\. Keep Your Eye Prescription Up to Date Frequent headaches, constant squinting and blurred vision are common signs you need to update your prescription eyewear. If you feel relief when you remove your glasses, it definitely means you need a new pair. Moreover, experts recommend getting new corrective eyeglasses every two years. 3\\\\. Protect Your Eyes From the Sun Your eyes are just as susceptible to sun damage as your skin. When heading outdoors, be sure to wear UV blocking sunglasses. Wearing a wide brimmed hat is another thing you can do to protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays. 4\\\\. Maintain a Healthy Diet Eating well balanced meals will benefit your eyes and overall well being. Incorporate foods high in zinc, omega 3 fatty acids, and vitamins A, C, and E into your diet. Leafy greens, nuts, fish, and colorful fruits and vegetables are especially rich in these nutrients. 5\\\\. Stay Hydrated Your eyes could suffer if you don’t drink enough water. Blurred vision, eye fatigue and a stinging sensation in the eyes are typical signs of dehydration. Drink at least eight glasses of water daily to hydrate your eyes and body. Don’t wait before you experience significant changes in your vision before seeing an eye doctor. Lumen Optometric is here to handle your eye care needs.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at Lumen Optometric share daily habits that can benefit your eyes and vision. 1\\\\. Wash Your Hands Thanks to recent events, hand washing should already be part of your daily routine coming from the outdoors. Even if you stay indoors most of the time, you should wash your hands regularly. Common vision related diseases like conjunctivitis (pink eye) are caused by touching in or around the eyes with unclean hands. 2\\\\. Wear Eye Protection Whether you’re mowing the lawn, doing some woodwork in your workshop, or performing home repairs, don’t risk eye injury and always wear eye protection. Protective glasses are easy to obtain, comes in many sizes, and can be worn over existing eyeglasses. If you’re working on anything that involves welding, make sure to wear a welding mask or goggles. 3\\\\. Handle Your Contact Lenses Carefully Your contact lenses come into direct contact with your eyes; you’ll definitely want to keep them clean. Always make sure that you’re handling them with clean hands, keep your contact lens cases sterilized, and discard expired contact lens solution. If you’re undergoing dry eye treatment, your eye doctor may prescribe a different type of contact lenses, with different handling instructions. Make sure you follow them closely to avoid damage to your eyes. 4\\\\. Maintain a Healthy Diet Eating fast food every day probably won’t make you go blind, but it’s not good for your health, either. Various studies have shown that a diet that contains significant amounts of foods that are rich in Omega 3 and lutein can help reduce the risk of cataracts, night blindness, and other eye problems. 5\\\\. Rest Your Eyes Most of us spend a significant portion of the day staring at computer screens, especially those who work from home. Make sure to rest your eyes every once in a while. The “20 20 20 Rule,” is a good daily practice to turn into a habit. The rule is simple: every 20 minutes, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Doing this several times a day can help reduce eye strain. Lumen Optometric is your leading provider of eye care services, including Neurolens® treatment. Give us a call at .

But how much do you really know about this eye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll explore 5 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about your child’s eye health and long term vision. 1\\\\. Myopia is an Eye Disease Myopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. 2\\\\. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye disease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people worldwide. If things don’t change, half of the world’s population will have some degree of myopia by the year 2050! 3\\\\. It’s a Progressive Condition Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. 4\\\\. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease Myopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight threatening eye diseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50% higher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop cataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults than children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of clear vision a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided their children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic maculopathy fell by 40%. 5\\\\.

In fact, there are many reasons to have them spend time outdoors, not least of which is to protect your child’s vision. Studies show that children who spend time playing outdoors in the sunshine experience less myopia progression than those who stay indoors. Moreover, encouraging more outdoor playtime is important for promoting overall health and wellbeing in your kids. Below we’ll explore some fun outdoor activity ideas to try with your kids and discuss why spending time outdoors may slow a child’s myopia progression or even postpone its onset. 5 Outdoor Activities to Do With Your Kids This Winter 1\\\\. Snow Play If you live in a snowy region, bundle up your kids in warm layers and have them: ● Build a snowman ● Enjoy a snowball fight ● Paint the snow with some food coloring or watercolors ● Make a snow maze ● Build an igloo ● Build snow castles (the same way you would sand castles) ● Make snow angels ● Collect snowflakes during a snow flurry and study their beautiful shapes 2\\\\. Blow Ice Bubbles Kids love playing with and popping bubbles. If temperatures are low enough, they might freeze in mid air! They’ll get a kick out of watching them freeze and possibly catching or popping them. To make your own bubble solution, mix 1 part water with 4 parts dish soap and a few drops of light corn syrup. It’s best to try this activity when winds are calm, as harsh breezes can cause the bubbles to pop before they freeze. Once the bubbles have landed on a surface and are completely frozen, they are beautiful to photograph which can be part 2 of this activity. 3\\\\. Go Sledding Sledding is a classic winter activity that your child will love. To go sledding, all you need is snow, a sled, and a hill! Easy enough. But before you hit the slopes (or hills), be sure to follow these safety guidelines: ● Choose a sled that can be steered and can brake ● Wear a helmet ● Dress warmly, but be careful as the scarf can get caught under the sled ● Children 5 years old and under should sled with an adult 4\\\\. Go on a Winter Scavenger Hunt A winter scavenger hunt is a wonderful way to explore nature with all of your senses. Before you head out, make a list of things to see, smell, listen for, and feel. Ask your child to check each item off the list. For example, your list can include listening for the sounds of birds chirping, footsteps crunching in the leaves, or water babbling in a nearby stream. On the list of things to look for, you can include different types of trees, animals, animal tracks, cloud shapes, birds’ nests, and more. Take your camera along and let your child take pictures of what they find. You can also leave an empty space on the list for your child to fill as they explore new things on their own. 5\\\\. Decorate a Tree with Edible Ornaments For Animals This activity is an unconventional twist on building a bird feeder and perfect for those who live near a forest. The idea is to make edible ornaments and hang them on a tree (or potted plant in your garden) for wildlife to feed on during the winter. Your ornaments can be made using various seeds, peanut butter, dried fruit, and popcorn. It’s best to use biodegradable materials to hang your ornaments, and don’t use fishing lines, as birds can get caught in it. What’s the Connection Between Time Outdoors and Myopia? There is increasing evidence that children who spend extra time daily playing outdoors have a reduced risk of developing myopia; and if they already have myopia, time spent outdoors could slow down the worsening of this condition, also known as myopia progression. These findings are significant, as having myopia significantly increases a child’s risk of developing sight threatening eye diseases later in life. Moderate to high levels of myopia make a child more susceptible to developing cataracts, retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and glaucoma later in life. At Treehouse Eyes, our mission is to battle childhood myopia by providing myopia management to nearsighted children. Our myopia management treatments can effectively slow down your child’s myopia progression and reduce their future risk of eye disease. If your child has myopia, or if you need your first consultation, contact us today to schedule a myopia eye exam. Wishing you and all of our patients a healthy and enjoyable winter season!

This way, your trusted optometrist can detect any conditions or diseases that may trouble them later on. Which eye conditions are these exactly? Lumen Optometric, the trusted eye exam doctor in the area, offers a quick overview of some of them. Refractive Errors These refer to conditions that can cause blurry vision. Refractive errors include farsightedness (hyperopia), when close objects appear distorted, nearsightedness (myopia), when objects viewed at a distance are blurry and astigmatism, when objects both near and far are unclear. They may occur when the cornea doesn’t bend, or refract, light properly. Symptoms include a disinterest in reading or viewing distant objects and squinting or turning the head in an odd fashion when watching television. Children diagnosed with refractive errors can be treated through prescriptive glasses, and even corneal reshaping, or orthokeratology (Ortho K). The latter refers to the use of gas permeable lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia, hyperopia and refractive errors. Ortho K is a safe and effective alternative to eyeglasses, refractive surgery, or contact lenses. Amblyopia Another common eye problem in babies and young children is amblyopia or ‘lazy eye’. This happens when the vision of one or both eyes did not develop properly during childhood, or when eye conditions, such as refractive errors, weren’t corrected promptly. Strabismus Also known as cross eyes, strabismus is when the eyes aren’t aligned properly–instead pointing at different directions. This causes loss of depth perception because the child learns to ignore the image received by the misaligned eye, relying only on the one from the straight, or better seeing eye. Treatment options for strabismus may include eyeglasses and vision therapy. Ptosis When the upper eyelid droops and restricts or blocks vision, this is called ptosis. A child with this condition may tip their head back, lift up their chin, or raise their eyebrows to try to see better, which may cause head or neck problems over time. Visit your local eye doctor for a thorough eye exam if your child exhibits these symptoms. Color Deficiency Also called color blindness, this eye problem makes it difficult for the child to distinguish specific shades of color. This is usually an inherited condition, but there are also certain diseases that can cause color deficits. While there is no cure for color deficiency, there are special glasses and contact lenses your child can wear that allow them to see color differences. To prevent or avoid lasting vision problems for your child, make sure to visit a premier eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a regular eye exam.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at Lumen Optometric shares a quick guide on contact lens solutions. Multipurpose Vs. Hydrogen Peroxide Solutions There are two types of contact lens solutions: multipurpose and hydrogen peroxide based. They serve the same purpose disinfect your contacts and remove debris but they work in different ways. Multipurpose solution, also known as all in one solution, is simple to use. Wash your hands, put your contacts in your palm, then moisten the lenses with the multipurpose solution. While some types of multipurpose solutions are marketed as “no rub” products, experts recommend rubbing the lenses with it for 10 seconds to remove remaining debris. Apply a drop of saline solution in each lense to rinse before wearing it. Hydrogen peroxide solution, on the other hand, requires more time or attention. Unlike multipurpose solutions, this type of contact lens solution does not “spoil,” and is ideal for people who are sensitive to certain chemicals, or for those undergoing therapy like dry eye treatment. Hydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at disinfecting contact lenses, but it must not touch the eye directly. To use it, fill a small case with the solution (most contact lenses come with such a case) and soak them for six to eight hours. Before taking out the contacts, a neutralizer must be applied to turn the hydrogen peroxide to a plain saline solution. Which One Should You Choose? Between the two, the multipurpose solution is the more cost effective and easy to use, and can be used virtually anywhere as long as you have a contact lens case or a clean surface to clean them in. However, it is not as effective at disinfecting contact lenses as the hydrogen peroxide solution. Making it an all in one solution requires certain chemicals that may not be ideal for some people who may be sensitive to certain substances. This also means it has a shorter shelf life. The hydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses, but there is a risk of harming the eye if one were to forget applying the neutralizer. It is also important not to reuse or top off the solution after use. Contact lens cases must also be replaced every one to three months to cut the risk of infection.

But apart from the style of your eyeglass frame, you should also look into the frame materials. Lumen Optometric, a trusted scleral optometrist and eyeglass provider, discusses some of the most popular materials used for eyeglass frames. Titanium Titanium is commonly used in designer glasses. It is an excellent material for eyeglass frames and hinges because it is very lightweight, sturdy, hypoallergenic and corrosion resistant. However, titanium is significantly more expensive than other frame materials. Titanium alloy, which is a combination of titanium and other metals, is typically used as a cheaper alternative to titanium. Stainless Steel Stainless steel is a reliable material for eyeglass materials. It’s durable, strong, hypoallergenic and non corrosive. It may not be as lightweight as other materials, but it can be easily shaped into ultra thin eyewear frames. Stainless steel is also flexible, and this usually adds to the comfort of eyeglass wearers. So whether you are wearing glasses most of the time or you’re only using it temporarily while undergoing dry eye treatment, this type of frame material can be really comfortable for you. Plastic Zyl or propionate is typically used in making the plastic frame material. Zyl, which is also known as cellulose acetate, is the most common type of plastic frame material. Meanwhile, propionate is the second most popular plastic frame material. It is hypoallergenic and nylon based, and it has a different look and feel than other types of plastic.

What’s less well known is what these different eye conditions are. Presbyopia is one of these diseases. It’s a condition that usually affects people aged over 40 and makes it harder for their eyes to focus on objects. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing small print, such as text messages, clearly. No need to worry though to help restore your vision, a scleral optometrist will prescribe you multifocal lenses if you’re a good candidate for one. In general, there are three types of multifocal lenses: Bifocal lenses – As the name suggests, bifocal lenses have two prescriptions: the upper lens helps you see objects from afar while the lower lens helps you read and focus on objects near you.Trifocal lenses – Like bifocal lenses, trifocal lenses have upper and lower lenses that help you with distance vision and reading respectively. The difference between the two is that trifocal lenses, as the name suggests, have a middle section that helps you with tasks that require intermediate vision, like using a laptop. Progressive lenses – Progressive lens don’t have the lines found on bifocal or trifocal lenses. That’s because the power of the lenses gradually changes from the top to the bottom. Adjusting to Your New Bifocal Lenses Multifocal lenses will take some getting used to. Here are some tips on adjusting to your new multifocal lenses: Wear your multifocal lenses all the time – You’ll get used to your new multifocal lenses faster if you wear them all the time. Don’t look down while walking or going down the stairs – The lower part of your bifocal lenses makes everything look bigger, so your feet may appear out of focus. If you need to look down while walking, make sure to tilt your head up and look through the upper portion of your multifocal lenses. Make sure your new multifocal eyeglasses fit your face properly – It’s harder to get used to multifocal eyeglasses and lenses if they don’t fit your face properly. For more info about your multifocal lenses, neurolens treatment, and your other treatment options, don’t hesitate to consult your eye doctor. Looking for eye specialists near you?

To help you further understand what dilated eye exams are, Lumen Optometric is here to answer the most commonly asked questions about this process. “What Is a Dilated Eye Exam?” A dilated eye exam involves pupil dilation, which is a simple and painless procedure performed to increase the size of the pupils. This process allows your ophthalmologist to assess the health of your optic nerve and retina. If you are nearsighted or farsighted, your eye doctor will give you dilating eye drops to check vision problems that hinder you from seeing clearly. “What Conditions Can It Detect?” Glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinal detachment and ocular tumor are some of the conditions that can be diagnosed with a dilated eye exam. This procedure provides optimum viewing of the dilated pupil, which allows for the diagnosis and monitoring of the retina. While there are some diseases that can be detected without pupil dilation, a dilated eye exam is still important to ensure an accurate and complete diagnosis. “What Can I Expect During the Exam?” When your eyes are dilated, your vision may be blurry and your eyes may be sensitive to light for a few hours. For your safety, ask a loved one to drive you home from your eye appointment. In case your eye doctor finds refractive errors in your vision, they may provide you with a prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses to help improve your eyesight. At Lumen Optometric, we are committed to providing only the best eye care services to help you take care of your vision problems.

The neurolens Measurement test will determine if you are a good candidate for neurolenses. These lenses are the first and only prescription lenses that can help correct the misalignment in a patient’s vision at all distances. Using neurolenses has been found to relieve symptoms like neck pain tension, eyestrain, headaches and eye fatigue. How Often Should I Use It? Your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen Optometric recommends that you wear your neurolenses during all your waking hours for the best results. If this is not possible, then you should at least wear these lenses while doing near work like reading or using a digital device. In general, you should see results with your neurolenses within your first three to seven days of wearing them. Some patients might take longer however, sometimes taking up to three weeks. Does It Still Work If I Use Contacts or If I Have 20 20 Vision? Your new neurolenses incorporate both your regular eyeglasses prescription and your contoured prism prescription. If you prefer wearing contact lenses, then you can order your neurolenses to only use your contoured prism prescription. You’ll just need to wear your neurolenses while wearing your contacts. This also means that people with 20 20 vision can still use neurolenses if they suffer from misalignment.

We meet dozens of parents and children every day who come in for eye exams, myopia treatments and other services. During these visits, we welcome and address questions or concerns that parents have about their child’s eye health. Because certain myopia treatments include contact lens wear, many parents ask whether they’re safe to wear for young children. Here’s what the research says: A recent study, Adverse Event Rates in The Retrospective Cohort Study of Safety of Paediatric Soft Contact Lens Wear: the ReCSS Study, shows that contact lenses for children are just as safe for children as they are for adults. (This study appears in the January 2021 issue of the peer reviewed Journal of Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics.) The study followed 963 children aged 8 to 16 over the course of 1.5 to 3 years (for a combined 2713 years of contact lens wear time) to determine the risk level associated with wearing soft contact lenses. All of the subjects were 13 years of age or under at the time of their first fitting, with more than half of the children fitted with soft contacts at or before the age of 10, on average. The study results indicate that age doesn’t play a role in contact lens safety. In fact, the risks of developing adverse reactions to contact lens wear among children proved to be the same as in adults. According to the study, the rate of inflammatory conditions associated with contact lens wear were less than 1% per year of wear. Multifocal Lenses for One effective method of myopia management includes the use of MiSight daily multifocal soft contact lenses. MiSight contact lenses are FDA approved for the treatment of myopia and have been shown to effectively slow down the rate of myopia progression. Many parents like this method as it requires minimal maintenance; at bedtime, the child discards the pair they are wearing, and inserts a fresh pair in the morning. It also rids the child of the need to wear glasses during the day, allowing them to freely partake in sports and other activities. The myopia management program at Treehouse Eyes can help preserve your child’s gift of sight for a lifetime. Treating your child’s myopia will give them clear vision today, while reducing their chances of developing sight threatening eye diseases later in life. it’s never too early to start treating myopia.

November 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Today, you can have your eyes checked without actually seeing your eye doctor using online vision tests. Many eye clinics offer these tests that you can accomplish via your smartphone. They claim to determine how sharp your vision is, if you have astigmatism, or experiencing eye sensitivity. Discover if online eye tests are any good and when they are useful from a local eye exam doctor. Are Online Eye Tests as Good as Visiting Your Eye Doctor? Typically, an online eye test only checks your visual acuity and gives an estimate of your refractive error. Sometimes, it includes contrast sensitivity and color blindness. However, this kind of test can’t determine if you have conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, or macular degeneration. Keep in mind that routine eye exams with your eye doctor are still irreplaceable. Get your eyes checked as frequently as advised by your eye specialist. Regular comprehensive eye exams can help with the early detection and treatment of different eye conditions, especially those that don’t show symptoms until their later stages. When Are They Helpful? When you’re away, and you break or lose your glasses or contact lenses, that’s when online eye tests are most useful. Sometimes, an online vision test can help keep track of your eyesight and refractive error between routine eye exams. Still, it helps to know that the results of some online eye tests have been validated with limited studies because it’s still a new and developing technology. More studies are required to ensure the accuracy of prescriptions generated by online vision tests. For your family’s eye care needs, turn to Lumen Optometric.

While they are a common, albeit harmless, condition among infants, blocked tear ducts developing in adults may indicate an underlying problem. Lumen Optometric, the trusted scleral optometrist in the area, shares more of the essentials you need to know. What Can Cause Blocked Tear Ducts? There are many different reasons blocked tear ducts can occur. These may develop because of an age related change, when the tiny openings (puncta) that allow tears to drain become narrower, which can cause a blockage. Other common reasons include infection of the eyes, tear duct system, or nasal passages. An injury or trauma can also result in blocked tear ducts. This can be as minor as foreign particles getting lodged in the eyes, or as serious as a blow to the head or a broken nose. What are the Symptoms of Blocked Tear Ducts? Watery eyes and excess tears streaming from the eyes may be signs of a blocked tear duct. But these may be accompanied by: Redness and irritation of the affected eyeCrust forming along the eyelidsExcess mucus or discharge from the eyesEye infections, like pink eye or conjunctivitisPain and inflammation of the inside corner of the eyeBlurred vision You should note, however, that watery eyes due to cold or sinus infection may be unrelated to a blocked tear duct. The same goes for swelling or redness in the eyes, which may be a result of an injury that doesn’t affect the tear ducts. When you’re experiencing some or most of the symptoms mentioned above, you should go see Lumen Optometric, your trusted local eye doctor promptly. We don’t just specialize in dry eye treatment–we can also manage a number of other eye conditions. How Do You Deal with Blocked Tear Ducts? While a blocked tear duct can result in discomfort and swelling, it is almost always correctable. Its treatment will depend on its underlying cause. To accurately pinpoint the reason for your blocked tear ducts, we’ll perform a comprehensive eye examination and, depending on the results, recommend the effective and appropriate solution.

January 8, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Today, children are more exposed to digital devices, which makes a lot of parents worry. Using devices like computers, cellphones, and tablets can result in digital eye strain. One of the things that are believed to help prevent the condition is blue light glasses. Find out if blue light glasses can protect children against digital eye strain from a scleral optometrist. Where Does Blue Light Come From? Blue light is visible light with shorter wavelengths but more energy than other light at the other end of the color spectrum. The main source of blue light is the sun but it can also come from your digital devices, LED lights, television screens, and fluorescent lights. Fortunately, there is no known evidence that blue light from screens is damaging to a child’s eyes. Do Blue Light Glasses Work? Kids who spend hours in front of screens are more prone to develop digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome. Among the most common signs of this eye condition are eye fatigue, headaches, shoulder or neck pain, changes in vision, and dry eye. To keep track of your child’s vision and ensure their eyes are healthy, visit your eye doctor regularly. At Lumen Optometric, you can count on us to take care of your child’s eyes. We specialize in myopia treatment, dry eye treatment, and more. Blue light glasses are available in prescription and non prescription lenses. These glasses have a slight yellow tint to the lenses and can help prevent digital eye strain in children. However, these glasses do not completely filter all blue light but they can reduce your child’s exposure by up to at least 80 percent. Still, the best way to prevent this eye condition is limiting your child’s screen time, especially for younger ones. For your family’s eye care needs, Lumen Optometric is here to help.

Let’s explore the efficacy of correcting visual habits in mitigating its advancement. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent ocular condition with multifaceted causes and implications. In this post, we delve into whether myopia can worsen despite corrected visual habits. The Mechanisms of Myopia Occurrence: The journey of myopia onset is intricate and begins before visual symptoms manifest. Research indicates that the eye undergoes accelerated axial growth one to two years before myopia becomes clinically evident. During this period, compensatory mechanisms within the eye attempt to counteract the elongation, including the flattening of the anterior surface of the lens. However, these mechanisms eventually exhaust themselves, leading to the establishment of myopic refractive status an early to mid stage irreversible pathological change. The Influence of Age on Myopia Progression: Understanding the age at which myopia sets in is crucial in predicting its progression. Studies suggest that the earlier myopia occurs and the faster it progresses, the less responsive it is to interventions aimed at improving visual habits. This underscores the importance of early detection and intervention in younger individuals to potentially mitigate the severity of myopia progression. Challenges in Eliminating Causative Visual Habits: While correcting visual habits is a fundamental aspect of managing myopia, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges associated with eliminating causative factors. Factors such as excessive near work, limited outdoor time, and genetic predispositions contribute to myopia development. Despite concerted efforts to modify these habits, complete eradication remains elusive, posing a continued risk for myopia progression. Conclusion : In conclusion, the journey of myopia progression is complex, and influenced by various factors including age, genetic predispositions, and environmental habits. While correcting visual habits is beneficial, it’s crucial to recognize the limitations in eliminating causative factors. Early intervention remains key in potentially slowing down myopia progression, emphasizing the importance of regular eye exams and proactive management strategies. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed to empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources to navigate their myopia journey effectively.

Blog eye care Can Poor Sleeping Habits Affect Your Eyes?Can Poor Sleeping Habits Affect Your Eyes? June 10, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Sleep is crucial to your health and to every part of your body, including your eyes. It ensures that your eyes have enough moisture and rest to perform well. If you are not getting enough sleep, this could affect your eyes and increase your risks of various side effects ranging from mild (dark circles and puffy eyes) to severe (eye infections and vision loss). Lumen Optometric, a trusted provider of contact lenses and eye care services, further discusses the negative impact of poor sleeping habits on your overall eye health. Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Eyes One common but less dangerous effect of poor sleep is having dark circles underneath your eyes. Some people, though, are more prone to having puffy eyes rather than dark circles after a night of inadequate sleep. In other cases, when people are not able to get enough sleep, they experience eye spasms and twitching throughout the day. This often makes it difficult to do work or activities like reading. It can also pose hazards if you are driving. Another usual side effect of sleep deprivation is having strained, dry and itchy eyes the next day. This is a slightly more serious effect of poor sleep. Dry eyes specifically can be painful and it can cause irritation. This is mainly because your eyes are not getting proper lubrication. Lack of sleep may also cause your eyes to be sensitive to light or your vision to be blurry. People who don’t get enough sleep have an increased risk of glaucoma, a condition caused by excessive buildup inside the eye. If you have been experiencing these symptoms more frequently, make sure to visit an eye exam doctor. You should also address the source of your eye symptoms in this case, poor sleeping habits. Tips on Improving Your Sleep Remember that your eyes go through a lot whenever you’re awake. They work several hours a day, so it is important to give them enough time to recover through sleep. If you are having problems getting a good quality of sleep, here are some tips that might help you: Exercise regularly. This can help you sleep better, but make sure to avoid it three hours before your bedtime.Get as much sunlight as you can during the day.As much as possible, avoid exposure to blue light and digital screens at least two hours before bedtime.Consider wearing an eye mask if you get stimulated even by the faintest of lights at night. You can also try blackout blinds to prevent outdoor lights from seeping into your bedroom.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says 90% of these incidents are preventable. Generally, the kind of eye protection you need depends on the potential hazards present in your workplace. A local orthokeratology expert shares some of the most common causes of workplace eye injuries. What Are the Common Causes of Workplace Eye Injuries? Flying Objects Does your job involve sanding, riveting, chiseling, hammering, riveting or machining? If so, you must wear appropriate eye protection like safety glasses, face shields or goggles. These tasks can expose you to small flying objects that can enter your eyes, including metal fragments, wood particles and cement chips. Chemicals You must be careful when working with chemicals because they can cause irreversible eye damage. Proper safety gear will protect your eyes from chemical splashes, fumes and vapors. Gasoline, grease, oil and paint thinner can also harm your eyes. Object or Tool Penetration Permanent eye damage can occur due to the penetration of tools or sharp objects. When this incident happens, seek medical attention immediately. Always wear safety glasses and avoid tools you have no experience using. Radiation Lasers and welding equipment can produce high levels of infrared, ultraviolet radiation and heat. Workers need to wear safety goggles when performing tasks involving these tools. Doing so will protect them from eye problems like cataracts, retinal burns and blindness. Which Eye Problems Usually Occur at Work? Digital Eye Strain Many jobs today require you to stare at digital screens for hours. If you spend a significant time in front of a computer, you might experience digital eye strain. Headaches, dry eyes and blurred vision characterize this condition. It can also cause neck and shoulder pain. These symptoms can occur due to glare on screens, poor seating posture and improper viewing distances. Uncorrected refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism can also trigger digital eye strain symptoms. The only way to know if you need prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses is to get an eye exam. Moreover, taking breaks from computer screens and ensuring good lighting will help alleviate eye strain. Eye Infection Usually, eye diseases spread in the workplace through droplets from sneezing or coughing. You might develop an eye infection if you accidentally touch your eyes with contaminated hands. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis occurs from exposure to Staphylococcus species and other bacteria. Its symptoms include eye redness, burning and a sensation of having something inside the eye. Artificial tears, antibiotics and other topical medications are the common treatment options for this eye condition. Regular visits to your eye exam doctor will go a long way in keeping your eyes healthy and maintaining good vision. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care needs.

You may be dealing with what’s known as computer vision syndrome (CVS). An orthokeratology and eyecare expert explores the causes and symptoms of CVS and how this condition can be corrected. Causes and Symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome Extended screen time, a lack of sufficient lighting, poor posture and bad visual habits can lead to computer vision syndrome. Over time, our eyes have a hard time focusing and refocusing on digital screens, causing multiple discomforts. The main symptoms of CVS include difficulty shifting focus, dry or itchy eyes, recurrent headaches, and blurred or double vision. In some cases, it may also cause neck, shoulder, and back pain, creating a ripple effect on your overall well being. Can Computer Vision Syndrome Be Corrected? The good news is that computer vision syndrome can be corrected. It is not a permanent condition, so your vision can improve significantly with the right approach and professional help. Here are just some of the methods that can be employed: Eye Exercises Specific eye exercises can be suggested by your eye exam doctor to alleviate the symptoms of CVS. These exercises can help strengthen your eye muscles and improve your eyes’ ability to focus. Prescription Glasses In some cases, prescription glasses specially designed for computer use may be recommended. These glasses have coatings to reduce glare and block harmful blue light emitted by digital screens. Vision Therapy This is a customized program of visual activities designed to correct specific vision problems and improve visual skills. Vision therapy can help treat CVS by training the eye muscles to reduce strain and improve visual comfort when using screens. Lubricating Eye Drops Dry eye is another symptom of CVS, and you can use lubricating eye drops to combat it. These drops help replenish your eye’s surface and maintain moisture. Environmental Modifications This could include adjusting the lighting in your workspace to reduce glare, positioning your computer screen at an optimal distance and angle, and increasing the font size on your screen to reduce eye strain.

During this appointment, your eye care professional will assess your eyes and determine the most suitable type of contact lenses for your needs. Here’s what you can expect during your contact lens fitting session. Assessment of Your Eye Health and Vision Needs Your eye care professional will begin by reviewing your medical and eye health history. This examination includes a check of visual acuity, an evaluation of eye movements and an examination of the general well being of your eyes to determine whether eye conditions might affect your suitability for wearing contact lenses. Precision Measurements for a Perfect Fit Following the eye health assessment, the optometrist or ophthalmologist will meticulously measure the curvature and diameter of your corneas. These measurements are crucial for determining the correct size and type of contact lenses that will provide the best fit for your eyes, preventing discomfort and potential complications. For instance, scleral lenses are larger than standard contact lenses and rest on the white part of your eye, the sclera. Due to their design, optometrists perform a more detailed fitting process for scleral contact lenses than regular contacts. Tailoring to Your Lifestyle and Preferences Your lifestyle and preferences play a significant role in the recommendation of suitable contact lenses. The eye care professional will take into account factors such as your level of physical activity, preferred wearing schedule and specific vision correction needs. Communicating your preferences ensures personalized recommendations. Follow Up Appointment A follow up appointment is typically scheduled after a week or two to ensure you adapt well to your new contact lenses. Your eye care professional will check for any changes in eye health and may adjust your prescription or lens type if necessary. They can also help you identify issues like dry eyes that could affect lens comfort and recommend dry eye treatment as needed. Contact lens fitting is a comprehensive process that requires professional expertise for the best outcome. Lumen Optometric is a premier eye care provider dedicated to improving your eye health.

Worry not we’re here to clear up all the confusion. Read on as Lumen Optometric explains why, when, and how your contact lenses may impact your examination results. Should You Wear or Not Wear Contact Lenses for an Eye Exam? Eye exams sometimes involve more than just reading a standard eye chart. There can be several tests, each targeting a different aspect of your eye health. The primary concern with leaving your lenses in during the exam is the potential for inaccuracies. Contact lenses can disguise certain eye conditions or changes in your prescription. They might also obscure indications of dry eye, a condition that demands effective treatment early on. As such, it is preferable to take contact lenses out at least two hours before the appointment. Doing so allows your cornea to revert to its natural shape which can be altered by prolonged contact lens wear ensuring a more accurate examination. Discussing Your Contact Lens Concerns During an Eye Examination During your eye exam, be sure to discuss your contact lens experiences with your eye care provider. This way, they can evaluate your eyes with them on and off. For instance, if you mention issues with blurry vision or eye fatigue, they might consider a neurolens treatment, a revolutionary option for correcting misalignments and bringing comfort. Likewise, if you’re a candidate for scleral lenses, they will have a specialized understanding of your contact lens fitting. Lenses should not just correct vision but should also promote overall eye health. Reach Out to Lumen Optometric Taking off your contact lenses before an eye exam is often beneficial, allowing your optometrist to conduct a more comprehensive and precise test.

September 1, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Contact lenses offer a safe and effective way to correct poor vision, being especially useful to those who find eyeglasses inconvenient or uncomfortable. But in order to get the most out of your contact lenses, you’ll need to make sure they’re worn properly. Some people, for instance, leave their contact lenses in for too long, which is risky and highly discouraged. Lumen Optometric, the premier eye exam doctor in the area, explains more. Why You Shouldn’t Overwear Contact Lenses Avoid wearing your contact lenses for too long in a day, and you absolutely shouldn’t leave them on when you sleep. Doing so can lead to complications with your eyesight. In fact, prolonged contact lens use may cause the wearer to experience the following symptoms: Inflammation of the cornea, or keratitisRedness and swelling of the conjunctiva, or the transparent skin covering the whites of the eyesEyelid swellingLight sensitivityBlurred visionDry eyesBurning sensation when the contact lens are inserted But How Long Is ‘Too Long’? The period may vary with each patient, but it’s generally recommended that contact lenses are worn for a maximum of 10 12 hours each day. Anything longer than that can put the eyes at risk of infection and discomfort. If you’re using contact lenses for the first time (and don’t have dry, sensitive eyes) your eye care specialist may suggest wearing them for 6 8 hours on that first day. How to Deal With Overwear If you’ve left your contact lenses for too long and are now experiencing adverse effects, the first thing you’ll need to do is visit a trusted eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a comprehensive eye exam and the necessary solution. Our eye specialists will suspend contact lens wear until all the symptoms have been resolved. As your eyes heal, we may suggest switching to a new lens material with higher oxygen permeability, or recommend using daily disposable lenses.

This condition pertains to the clouding of the lens of the eye. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 17.2% of Americans older than 40 have cataracts in one or both eyes. While a common eye condition, many myths still surround cataracts. A local orthokeratology specialist debunks five of them. 1\\\\. Cataracts Only Occur in Older Adults One of the most popular misconceptions about cataracts is that they only occur in older adults. The truth is they can be present at birth. Cataracts can also develop in younger individuals, and some medications can increase your risk for cataracts, such as corticosteroids. 2\\\\. Overusing Your Eyes Can Cause Cataracts How much you use your eyes doesn’t have anything to do with your risk of developing cataracts. However, cataracts can make doing up close work more challenging. While healthy lifestyle changes can’t prevent cataracts, they can slow down the eye condition’s progression. 3\\\\. Eye Drops Can Treat Cataracts No eye drops can prevent or dissolve cataracts. Cataracts are not growths but changes in the structure of the lens. Removing and replacing the affected lens is the only way to treat this eye condition. If you have cataracts, only an eye exam doctor can determine which treatment option suits you. 4\\\\. Cataract Surgery Is Risky Cataract surgery is one of today’s safest procedures, with a success rate of 95%. It’s painless and only takes around 15 to 20 minutes. You can usually leave the hospital a few hours following the surgery. Most patients recover within four weeks, but some notice a significant improvement in their vision a few days after the procedure. 5\\\\. Cataracts Can Go Back Following Surgery Once the affected lens has been replaced, cataracts will not recur. However, some people may experience cloudy vision because the membrane holding the synthetic lens can decline with age. Fortunately, a quick and safe in office laser procedure can address this issue.

However, beware of what is and isn’t true about your eyes. Doing your research and learning the truth can help you better take care of your eyes. A local scleral optometrist debunks some of the most common myths about vision and eye health. Reading in the Dark Is Harmful to Your Eyes Your mom has probably told you that you shouldn’t read in the dark because it will damage your eyes. Reading in low lighting conditions may lead to eye fatigue or a headache but it can’t cause permanent damage. Constantly Wearing Your Glasses Will Weaken Your Eyes Wearing glasses will not make your eyes weak. While some eye conditions will get worse over the years, it doesn’t have anything to do with glasses. Moreover, your glasses are there to help you see better and correct your vision. Using Digital Devices a Lot Is Bad for Your Eyes Using your phone, computer, and other digital devices for an extended period can result in eye fatigue. However, it will not result in nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. To avoid eye strain, make sure you’re taking breaks in between using your devices. It would also help to wear the right eyewear. At Lumen Optometric, we offer neurolens treatment and other vision correction options. Eating Carrots Will Make Your Vision Better Another common myth about your vision is that it will improve by eating carrots. This vegetable is rich in vitamin A, which is necessary for you to maintain good eyesight. However, your body only needs a tiny amount of vitamin A for vision and you can get it from other sources like fish, dairy, darky leafy greens, and bright colored vegetables.

In this blog post, we’ll explore this topic and examine the existing evidence surrounding the relationship between sleep patterns and vision in children and teenagers. The Link Between Sleep Habits and Vision: Currently, there’s a lack of direct clinical trial evidence confirming the precise impact of sleep habits on vision. However, intriguing findings from animal models provide suggestive insights into this connection. Disrupting the overall circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep wake cycles, may potentially influence refractive development in the eye. Understanding the Role of Circadian Rhythm: The eye is a complex organ, with various components operating on their own biological rhythms. These include the cornea, choroid, intraocular pressure, and lens. Disrupting these biological rhythms can affect the rate of eye growth, potentially impacting vision development over time. Indirect Evidence and Myopia Risk: While direct clinical evidence is lacking, indirect evidence from animal models suggests that staying up late and waking up late common habits among children and teenagers may increase the risk of myopia. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent vision condition characterized by difficulty seeing distant objects clearly. Considerations and Caution: It’s essential to interpret these findings with caution and recognize the limitations of extrapolating animal model data to human populations. While suggestive, these findings do not provide definitive answers regarding the impact of sleep habits on vision in children and teenagers. Conclusion: In conclusion, the relationship between sleep habits and vision in children and teenagers remains an area of ongoing research and investigation. While animal model studies suggest a potential link between disrupted circadian rhythms and vision development, direct clinical evidence is needed to confirm these findings in human populations. Fostering healthy sleep habits for children is essential for overall well being, including their vision health. Encouraging consistent sleep schedules and adequate rest may contribute to optimal vision development.

May 8, 2020 by Lumen Optometric It’s not uncommon to feel irritation or scratchiness in our eyes. This sensation is typically associated with dry eye and seasonal allergies, even though the difference between the two is often muddled. This may be due to the fact that both conditions can affect our eyes simultaneously, the symptoms overlapping. Fortunately, with a specific dry eye treatment and simple lifestyle tweaks, your visual issues can still be corrected. What Is Dry Eye? Dry eye is a common problem that is likely to occur after age 50. It is a condition experienced by people who don’t have enough quality tears to lubricate and nourish their eyes. Dry eye can occur due to several causes, including tears not being made properly and tears evaporating too fast. Other patients may have a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, where the glands in the eyelids become clogged, preventing the production of oil found in tears. More than 86% of all patients with dry eye have this condition. Another possible reason for dry eye is ocular misalignment which can be corrected by neurolens treatment. Is It Seasonal Allergies? The symptoms of seasonal allergies can be similar to dry eye, but the indicating sign is itchiness. When the eye is exposed to an allergen like pollen and pet dander, histamines are released, causing the eyes to itch or tear. If seasonal allergies are affecting your eye, taking antihistamine can be quite effective to fight the inflammation. There are other steps you can take to ease your allergy symptoms. Close the windows and doors in your eyes when the pollen count is high outdoors. Use clean mattress covers on your bed to prevent dust mites. Use a dehumidifier in your home when humidity levels are high to prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Wear sunglasses when you’re outside to help keep pollen out of your eyes. When experiencing a severe dry eye, it’s safer not to assume the cause and instead seek out professional advice from an eye doctor or a scleral optometrist. Here at Lumen Optometric, we can expertly determine the cause of your symptoms and prescribe the appropriate treatment plan. Call us today at or fill out this contact form to schedule an appointment.

Read on to discover how sports eyewear can help improve your performance and where you can find personalized eyewear solutions just right for your sport of choice. Benefits of Wearing Sports Eyewear The right sports eyewear can be a game changer in the following ways: Enhancing Visual Performance Stepping up your game begins with seeing the game better. Sports eyewear, whether it’s a simple pair of sports glasses or customized contact lenses, can significantly enhance your ability to focus and see clearly. For every basketball player aiming for the hoop or a tennis player watching out for the incoming serve, better vision equals better performance. Protective Features Beyond improving your vision, another crucial reason to wear sports eyewear is to protect your eyes from potential injuries. High speed sports like hockey or racquetball create numerous opportunities for errant balls or pucks to cause serious harm to your eyes. Protective sports eyewear can guard against these risks and provide peace of mind as you play. Importance of Correct Prescription and Fit Just like the right cleats or a cozy pair of gloves, having the proper prescription and fit for sports eyewear is essential. An incorrect prescription can defeat the purpose of wearing eyewear and hinder your game performance. Similarly, eyewear that doesn’t fit securely can become a distraction or slip off at an inconvenient time. It’s crucial to consult an eye exam doctor to ensure your prescription is up to date and your eyewear fits well. Different Types of Sports Eyewear Depending on the sport, there are many types of eyewear to choose from. Sports Glasses These are excellent for those who require a prescription for their vision but also need the structural robustness to withstand physical sports. Sports glasses typically have reinforced frames and lenses to maintain their shape and performance. Prescription Sports Goggles For those involved in high impact sports, prescription sports goggles offer a higher level of protection. They fit snugly to your face to prevent any foreign objects or harsh sunlight from impairing your vision. Sports Sunglasses For those sunny outdoor games, sports sunglasses not only improve your vision but also shield your eyes from harmful UV rays, helping to prevent long term eye damage.

These are often serious and need medical attention. Neurolens treatment specialist Lumen Optometric has shared below what you need to do if you have the following injuries: Embedded Foreign Object If an object, such as a piece of glass or metal, penetrates or enters the globe of the eye and or is sticking out, you’ll need to call for emergency medical help or bring the child to the emergency room as soon as possible. You should also cover the affected eye with a small cup taped in place so that it keeps all pressure off the eye. Make sure to keep your child (and yourself) as calm and comfortable as possible until help arrives. Irritations If your child has dirt, sand, or other foreign bodies on their eye surface, our resident scleral optometrist recommends that you wash your hands thoroughly and examine the eye. Don’t touch, rub, or press the eye itself except by flushing, as other methods can easily scratch the surface, especially the cornea. Next, tilt your child’s head over a basin or sink with the affected eye down and gently pull down the lower lid. Encourage your child to open the eyes as wide as possible, but if it’s an infant or small child, it’s helpful to have a second person hold the child’s eyes open while you flush. Afterward, gently pour a steady stream of lukewarm water from a pitcher or faucet over the eye, and flush for up to 15 minutes. Check the eye every 5 minutes to see if the foreign body has been flushed out. When you need to have your eyes checked by a trusted dry eye treatment expert, don’t hesitate to visit Lumen Optometric.

Moreover, if your lenses fog throughout the day and you feel like you need to remove them already, don’t hesitate to do so. Typically, fogging occurs as a result of poor alignment of the lens with the eye. In this kind of situation, the lens rocks and causes mucus to form. The mucus then becomes trapped in the saline layer of the lens, which causes the blurry vision. That said, it is important to get the best fit of scleral lenses for your eyes in order to minimize filming or fogging. Rub Lenses After Removing Make sure to rub your lenses after removing them so as to remove surface debris. You can ask your scleral optometrist to demonstrate the proper way of doing this so that you can avoid damaging the lenses. Generally, it is ideal to rub each lens for two to 20 seconds, depending on your care solution. Use a Filling Solution With No Preservatives A preservative free filling solution is the best way to keep your eye’s health at an optimum level. Regular eye drops can cause damage to your eyes and your lenses because these often contain preservatives, so you should avoid using them at all times. Lumen Optometric offers a range of eye care services. Our expertise includes neurolens treatment, scleral lenses, myopia management, and more.

Do you experience these two problems at the same time as well? Is there a way to avoid or lessen their effects? Dry eye treatment experts from Lumen Optometric share some info! Dry Eye and Migraines Studies have been conducted on the theory of dry eye and migraines being involved with one another and worsening the effects of both. A study titled Tear Osmolarity and Subjective Dry Eye Symptoms in Migraine Sufferers was made in 2017 and was made to explore this correlation. Tear osmolarity refers to the amount of salt content in an individual’s tears. Tear osmolarity is a regular test for dry eyes, as the higher the salt content of a person’s tears, the more prone they are to dry eye. In the above mentioned study, they had 34 migraineurs in the research group, and during the observation period, migraine attacks were generally accompanied by dry eye. Additionally, the more frequent the migraine attacks became, their tear osmolarity also increased. To summarize, the study focused on the link between migraines, dry eye, and tear osmolarity. And during the study, when migraines occurred, the effects of dry eye were also observed. And the more migraines with severe pain and discomfort the research subjects experienced, the saltier their tears became, resulting in them becoming more susceptible to dry eye. Dry Eye Treatment Contact lens users are very susceptible to the effects of dry eye, and these lenses need the right amount of lubrication to function comfortably on the surface of the eyes. If you’re someone who uses a contact lens and has been having bouts of dry eye, contacting your scleral optometrist or nearest eye clinic would be the best course of action. If you’re getting dry eye that comes with migraine, lessening the effects of both is possible by getting the proper dry eye prescription and taking standard medications against migraines. Commonly, treatment for dry eye is done by the use of artificial tears, as dry eye happens when your eyes can’t get the right amount of lubrication they need. With eyes that lack the proper amount of lubrication, artificial tears are the optimal way to address dry eye. They are available over the counter and come in the form of liquid, gel, or ointment types. If your eyes are always tearing up and lessening your tear reserves, getting assistance from an eye care clinic and requesting tear duct plugs is a good way to prevent dry eye. Contact Us!

Determining the cause of your eye discomfort can be tricky, and getting the correct diagnosis and treatment to find relief is essential. Continue reading to learn the difference between eye allergies and infections, their symptoms, and when it’s time to seek professional help. Symptoms of Eye Allergies If you’re dealing with an eye allergy, some common symptoms might include itching and redness, as well as watery or teary eyes. Your eyelids may also appear swollen and you could experience sensitivity to light. These symptoms are usually caused by your body’s immune response to allergens, leading to inflammation and discomfort. Symptoms of Eye Infections On the other hand, eye infections often come with different symptoms, such as pain or discomfort in the eye itself. You may notice yellow, green, or bloody discharge and crusting around the eye. Blurry vision or vision loss can be associated with eye infections too, so it’s essential to pay close attention if you notice any of these signs. Causes of Eye Allergies Eye allergies can be triggered by various factors, such as seasonal allergens like pollen and grass or indoor allergens like dust mites and pet dander. Irritants such as smoke, perfume or chemicals can also cause allergic reactions in your eyes, making them feel itchy and uncomfortable. Causes of Eye Infections Eye infections, on the other hand, can arise from bacterial infections (like staphylococcus or streptococcus), viral infections (such as herpes or adenovirus) or even fungal infections (like aspergillus or candida). These types of diseases can be more severe and require immediate attention from a medical professional. Diagnosis and Treatment If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, it’s crucial to consult a professional for a proper diagnosis. At Lumen Optometric, we offer a variety of treatments to address your specific needs. For instance, our Neurolens treatment is an excellent option for those experiencing eye strain and discomfort. If your eyes are feeling chronically dry and irritated, our dry eye treatment can provide much needed relief. If you wear contact lenses, our skilled scleral optometrist can help fit you with the most comfortable lenses possible. Prevention Tips To help prevent eye allergies and infections, it’s essential to practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly. Avoid allergens and irritants as much as possible, and keep your living space clean to minimize exposure to indoor allergens. Regular eye exams and check ups are also crucial to catching any potential issues early on.

Even if your vision seems clear, getting routine eye exams is essential. Many people aren’t even aware of an eye problem until they see an eye specialist. A local scleral optometrist shares why regular eye exams matter even if you have 20 20 vision. Keep Track of Vision Changes You will never know if your vision has changed or if you need to start wearing prescription glasses until you see a specialist. Eye doctors will perform various tests to trace even the slightest changes in your vision. Regardless of age, you should schedule regular eye exams. It will ensure you have the appropriate vision correction eyewear, allowing you to see clearly and comfortably. Your eye doctor can also determine if you need dry eye treatment during your appointment. Early Detection of Vision Threatening Conditions Specialists can catch early signs of sight threatening conditions during comprehensive eye exams. Cataracts, macular degeneration and glaucoma are some eye problems that don’t manifest apparent symptoms until in their later stages. Early detection and treatment are crucial in preserving vision and delaying the progression of these eye conditions. Catch Signs of Other Health Issues Your eyes can say a lot about your overall health. It isn’t uncommon for eye doctors to detect indications of other health issues while assessing their patients’ eyes. If this is the case, they will encourage you to get further assessments from a medical practitioner. Common conditions caught during comprehensive eye exams include diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, multiple sclerosis and thyroid diseases. At Lumen Optometric, we will thoroughly assess your eyes to catch problems that can affect your vision. Let us help you monitor your vision and eye health!

We believe in helping our patients by providing them with the information that they need to safeguard their vision and eye health. We strongly suggest scheduling comprehensive eye exams every one to two years and familiarizing yourself with some of the early signs of eye conditions. In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric discusses the eye symptoms that you shouldn’t ignore. Double Vision If you experience double vision when both of your eyes are open, then it might mean that your eye muscles aren’t aligned properly. Possible causes for this condition can include serious neurological problems, so you need to take this symptom seriously. If you only have double vision in one eye, then you might have an issue related to your retina or a cataract. We recommend scheduling an appointment with us immediately so we can figure out the cause of this problem. Itching and Burning Sensation If you feel an itching and burning sensation in your eyes then you might have a condition called blepharitis. This condition is caused by bacteria or microscopic mites that live on your eyelids. Other possibilities include a painful inflammation of the eyelid’s oil gland, infections, styes, or overexposure to UV rays. As an expert in contact lenses and eye exams, we can figure out the cause of this symptom. Sudden Increase in Floaters If you experience a sudden increase in the number of floaters, then you need to see your eye doctor as soon as possible. This can indicate that the retina and blood vessels have been torn. If you also see flashes of light, then this can be a sign of retinal detachment. Fortunately, eye doctors have a lot of options when it comes to treating this condition. The treatment depends on the location and size of the tear. If you need to schedule an eye exam, then give Lumen Optometric a call. We offer comprehensive eye exams, orthokeratology and other vision care services.

For people with poor vision, eyeglasses are their windows to a clearer and more vivid world, so making sure that their glasses are well maintained and properly cared for is a high priority. If you wear glasses, there are a few things that you should keep in mind to keep your eyeglasses in an optimal condition, and corneal reshaping experts from Lumen Optometric are here to help! Wiping Don’t use wet wipes, napkins, or paper towels. These cleaning materials are made of wood pulp and have roughly textured surfaces that can scratch the lenses of your eyeglasses and can affect the coating on them too. As much as you need to, avoid using the hem or the edge of your clothes in cleaning them as well. Unless your shirt is made purely with cotton, wiping your lenses with it can cause more trouble in the long run. Microfiber cloth is the best material to use when wiping grime, dirt, and other substances off the lenses, as they are designed to do so with great care and efficiency. Handle With Care When performing maintenance and cleaning on your specs, remember to properly handle them. Take them off by holding both sides, and don’t pull them off by using one hand, as this is one of the most common causes of joint snapping for older eyeglasses. Avoid holding them by one of their frame arms, as it can bend your eyeglasses at an awkward angle and can cause fitting issues. If you’re gonna wipe the lenses, hold your eyeglasses by the bridge (the part that goes over your nose) and gently wipe the lenses in a circular motion. If taking care of eyeglasses feels like a hassle for you, you can try having contact lenses prescribed to you instead. Cleaning Solutions Using strong chemical cleaning solutions on the surface of your lenses is not a good idea, as most household cleaning fluids contain ammonia or some other form of strong acids. These can destroy and erode the protective coating over the lenses, and leave minuscule amounts of the chemical on the surface of the lenses that are facing inwards toward your eyes, which can cause irritation and discomfort, or worse, dry eye.

Let’s explore the pros and cons of glasses and contacts to help you make the best choice for your eyes and lifestyle. Advantages of Contact Lenses Contact lenses offer a clear, natural field of view without any obstructions or distortions at the edge of your vision. For those concerned with their appearance, contact lenses won’t block your face or alter your appearance, although some can change your eye color. For athletes and those leading an active lifestyle, contact lenses are the way to go as these are less likely to be dislodged. The range of options available is vast. You can choose daily disposables, weeklies or even monthlies based on your comfort level and lifestyle. Before making your decision, schedule a comprehensive eye exam to identify any specific concerns or determine whether you need to work with a scleral optometrist. Disadvantages of Contact Lenses On the flip side, contact lenses require maintenance. They need to be properly cleaned and stored, which can be time consuming. Some people may even feel discomfort or irritation, especially if they have sensitive eyes. Dry eyes can be a common issue for people considering the switch. Dry eye treatment is available and can greatly ease the transition to contact lenses. You may also want to consider a trial period with contacts before you fully commit to the switch. The risk of eye infections also increases as contacts are directly worn on the eye. On top of that, the recurring expenses for contact lenses and care products can add up, making them an expensive choice in the long run.

Eyesight only refers to the ability a person has to see clearly without any corrective lenses, which varies from person to person and can change over time. Meanwhile, vision is the ability to process what a person sees and it can be improved with practice. Lumen Optometric, the eye center to trust for neurolens treatment, gives more insight on how they differ from each other. Eyesight This is something that takes place in the eye. Light enters through the front of the eye and then an image is created on the retina. If the eye is not perfectly shaped, the image may not focus perfectly on the retina. When this happens, some may wear glasses or contact lenses in order to improve eyesight or clarity of what they see, or in some cases, wear special lenses prescribed by their trusted scleral optometrist. The image of what they see in their eyesight is then transferred to the brain where vision takes place. Vision This takes place in the brain. The brain receives a clear image and then the vision is the process of understanding and analyzing the image. The brain automatically filters the information and determines what information is important and ignores the rest of the information. Vision can be both consciously or subconsciously processed and is affected not only by information coming in but also by what we expect to see due to prior knowledge. How Do They Work Together? Let’s say a child is presented with a picture of a cow. Eyesight is used to see the image clearly, while vision processes what they see and recognizes what the image is. When an eye doctor tells the child that they have 20 20 vision, they’re really saying that their eyesight is fine. While this means the child can see clearly, vision still refers to recognizing the image and whether both their eyes work together to process what they see. So, if the child has never seen a cow before, their vision won’t be able to recognize what the image is.

Having myopia as a child significantly increases the risk of developing sight threatening conditions like macular degeneration,, glaucoma, and retinal detachment later in life. Even children with low levels of myopia have a greater risk of glaucoma and retinal detachment compared to their non myopic counterparts. The good news is that slowing down the progression of myopia can drastically lower the risks of developing eye disease later in life. Innovative products like MiSight 1 day contact lenses help ensure a healthier future for myopic children. As part of the Treehouse Eyes network, we are proud to be one of the first practices in the country to be certified to fit MiSight 1 day contact lenses for myopia treatment, and be part of the Brilliant Futures Program. CooperVision, which manufactures MiSight 1 day lenses, calls Brilliant Futures “the new standard of care” for children with myopia. “It provides inclusive practice, child and parent support to create the optimal environment for compliance, satisfaction, clinical outcomes and long term loyalty, all via a comprehensive management program featuring MiSight 1 day daily disposable contact lenses.” What are MiSight 1 Day Contact Lenses? MiSight 1 day contact lenses are soft lenses that are worn daily and disposed of after each use. A fresh pair of contacts are placed into the eyes every morning to provide the child with crisp and clear vision while also slowing the eye’s elongation the source of progressive myopia. These contacts are safe and easy for children to use since they require almost no maintenance. Four different clinical trials were conducted to study the safety and effectiveness of MiSight lenses over a 3 year span; 135 children between the ages of 8 12 participated in the trials. Those who wore MiSight contacts experienced considerably less myopia progression than those who wore conventional soft contact lenses. MiSight 1 Day Contact Lenses: A Popular Choice CooperVision recently partnered with Sarah Michelle Gellar, a well known American actress, entrepreneur and producer, to help spread awareness about the importance of myopia management and annual eye exams for myopic children. The need for myopia management hit home for Gellar, who is myopic herself and has a child with myopia. “My husband and I are both nearsighted and our myopia has continued to worsen over time. We want our kids to have a chance for better vision and lower their risk for future eye health issues” explains Gellar. While regular eyeglasses or contacts help children see a whiteboard or tennis ball, “MiSight 1 day lenses offer children the benefits of clear vision while slowing myopia progression during their growing years. That is why I am thrilled to be partnering with CooperVision on this campaign,” Gellar says. Moreover, many parents are pleased to learn that MiSight 1 day contact lenses are FDA approved. In November 2019, the lenses received FDA approval to slow myopia progression in children who are 8 12 years old at the time of their first fitting making MiSight 1 day contact lenses the only FDA approved soft contact lenses for myopia management! We Are Proud to Be Part of the Movement In addition to MiSight, our highly trained and experienced doctors can offer other treatment options to manage childhood myopia, including specialized overnight wear contact lenses and prescription eye drops.

GMAC, of which Treehouse Eyes is a member, invited junior racers to the go kart track for an unexpected eye exam before heading out for some fun! A recent survey of parents by the Global Myopia Awareness Coalition found \\u200b\\u200b” half of the parents reported their children spent more than four hours using electronic devices each day during the pandemic, compared to 18% of parents reporting the same behavior prior to the pandemic.” Most children don’t notice anything is wrong with their vision until it starts to really impact their activities. Eye screenings done by a pediatrician are important, but they don’t always pick up on myopia, especially at lower levels. This is why GMAC decided it was more important than ever to raise awareness of myopia and the treatments available. Watch the “Little Kid License” video now: In the same survey mentioned above, GMAC discovered that “ more than 70% of parents believe their pediatrician will flag any issues related to their children’s eyesight and, almost the same amount trust that their child would say something if they had vision issues.” Unfortunately, this is often not the case. But, why is this such an important problem to face? Myopia develops rapidly as children grow. Remember, your child’s eye grows like any other part of their body as they age. Since children are prone to growth spurts, naturally their eyes are as well. Myopia occurs when a child’s eyes grow too fast, leading to blurry distance vision and greater risk for eye diseases later in life. We know the start of the school year is insanely busy with back to school activities along with the everyday obligations of work and life, but it’s now more important than ever to find a provider that understands how to diagnose and treat your child’s myopia.

Don’t be haunted by an eye infection. If you’d like to obtain decorative lenses for a Halloween costume, make sure to get an eye exam so your eye doctor can give the proper prescription and provide you with information about the proper contact lens cleaning and care. 2\\\\. Get A Prescription For Decorative Lenses The CDC and the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend not to purchase decorative contact lenses from costume shops, online stores, beauty salons, drug stores, flea markets, or anywhere that doesn’t require a prescription. Make sure to see a doctor to get lenses properly fitted, so your child isn’t at risk for vision problems such as eye infections and eye sores which can lead to permanent vision loss. Learn more about decorative lenses here. 3\\\\. Be Mindful Of Makeup Use Halloween makeup can be a fun way to enhance any costume, but it’s essential to not share makeup for the risk of eye infection.

Fortunately, you’re not stuck wearing such lenses, thanks to high index lenses. In today’s post, your local eye exam doctor at Lumen Optometric shares a look at high index lenses. Regular Lenses People suffering from refractive errors nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism choose to wear eyeglasses to correct their vision: it’s easier to wear than contact lenses, not as invasive or costly as an eye operation, and it can be fashionable. Eyeglasses correct refractive errors by compensating for factors such as eye length and the curvature of the cornea and lens, providing good vision. Sometimes a person’s vision may require strong eyeglass prescriptions that require thicker lenses. Most eyeglass wearers are nearsighted, which requires lenses that are thinner at the center than at the edges. The stronger the prescription, the thicker the edges will be, which can result in heavy lenses. This can limit one’s options in terms of eyewear selection, as one may need to stick to thicker frames to hold their lenses. Wearing contact lenses might not be an option for some people. High Index Lenses Many of today’s eye care centers offer high index lenses as an option. They provide the same level of refractive correction as regular lenses but are much thinner. High index lenses offer the following benefits: Thinner and lighter High index lenses have thinner edges even at high power, which opens up a wider selection of frame styles for you. Lighter lenses also make it easy to wear, even for prolonged periods. Aesthetically pleasing One reason why some people dislike wearing glasses is that high power lenses tend to look like the bottom of a soda bottle, colloquially called “Coke bottle glasses,” which makes the eyes look smaller (for nearsighted prescriptions) or larger (for farsighted prescriptions). High index lenses are “aspheric,” that is, less rounded than regular lenses, which means even high power lenses won’t distort your facial features.

Blog eye care How Can Vision Problems Affect Learning in Children?How Can Vision Problems Affect Learning in Children? January 22, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Your child’s academic performance highly depends on their sight. 80% of learning occurs through vision, meaning eye problems can hinder your little one’s ability to do well in school. Moreover, many young kids aren’t aware they have issues with their vision or don’t complain of symptoms. That’s why regular appointments with your local eye doctor matter. A local scleral optometrist shares how poor vision can affect children’s learning. Difficulty Focusing Myopia or nearsightedness is a common refractive error in children. Individuals with this eye condition can find it difficult to see distant objects. If your child is nearsighted, they might struggle to see the text on the board, which can cause them to lose focus. Their grades could suffer when they can’t concentrate on and understand their teacher’s instructions. If you’ve noticed that your child keeps squinting or holding reading materials too closely to their face, schedule a visit with your eye doctor immediately. Only eye specialists can confirm if they are nearsighted and require prescription glasses. At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to assist with your family’s eye care needs. Aside from contact lenses and glasses, we offer dry eye treatment. Poor Reading Comprehension Vision issues can impact a child’s reading comprehension skills. The eyes must work harmoniously to move across the page, recognize letters and understand the text. It isn’t uncommon for children with vision related learning problems to get confused with similar looking letters, shapes and words because they can’t see the figures properly. Compromised Hand Eye Coordination Several studies have shown that exercise during school days can improve academic performance. If your little one doesn’t like playing outside with other kids or tends to shy away from activities that require distant vision, there’s a chance that they have problems with their sight. Your child won’t be able to enjoy the benefits of physical activity on their cognitive and motor skills if they don’t exercise during the day. At Lumen Optometric, we are here to help you reach your child’s fullest potential by providing reliable eye care services. Our team specializes in myopia management.

Blog eye care How Do You Put in and Remove Your Contact Lenses?How Do You Put in and Remove Your Contact Lenses? May 11, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Contact lenses are a common option for correcting refractive errors, like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. They can give you a more natural look than eyeglasses and are generally safe to wear as long as you care for them properly. Many first time wearers tend to find it challenging to put in and remove their contacts. Put in and take out your contacts easily using these helpful tips. How to Put in Your Contacts Before handling your contacts, wash and dry your hands. Failing to do so heightens the risk of eye infections and corneal ulcers from bacteria exposure. Wash your hands using soap and warm water to ensure they are clean. Moreover, avoid drying your hands with cloths or towels with lint. Go in front of a mirror and stand on a flat surface. If there’s a sink below you, make sure to plug the drain. To avoid confusion, make it a habit to put in the same lens first. Place your contacts on the tip of your index or middle finger of your dominant hand. Inspect your lenses for scratches or damaged areas. If your lens forms a blow and the edges turn up, it means it’s in the correct position. Hold your upper lid open with your non dominant hand while in front of a mirror, and hold down your lower lid with the ring finger of your dominant hand. It’s now time to put the lens in your eye, which you should do while looking at the ceiling. To allow your lens to get in place, shut your eyes and roll them in a circular motion. Open your eyes and blink a couple of times. Check your eyes in the mirror to see if the contacts are in the center of your eyes. You’ll know your lenses are in the right position if you’re comfortable and seeing clearly. If not, take out the lenses and reinsert them. Repeat the same procedure to your other eye once you’ve successfully put in the first lens. How to Take Them Out Again, make sure your hands are clean and dry before touching your contacts. Remove any leftover contact lens solution from the case and allow them to dry or dry with a clean cloth. Get in front of a mirror and gaze up. Pull your lower lid down using the middle finger of your dominant hand. It helps to take off the same lens first to save yourself from confusion. Gently push the lens down to the white of your eye using the index finger of your dominant hand. Carefully pinch the lens with your index finger’s pads and thumb to take it off your eye. Do the same procedure to remove the lens from your other eye. Need to upgrade your contact lens prescription? Lumen Optometric has options for different vision correction needs.

August 25, 2021 by Lumen Optometric There is nothing wrong with drinking alcohol occasionally or in moderation. However, too much of it can harm various parts of your body, including your eyes. It can also affect your current and future eye health and vision. Continue reading to learn how alcohol affects your eyes and vision from a local scleral optometrist. What Does Alcohol Do to Your Eyes? Moderate drinkers should expect the effects of alcohol to wear off after a while, especially if they take proper care of their bodies after drinking. After going out for drinks with your friends, make sure to drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated. It’s also important to get sufficient rest and sleep. Meanwhile, heavy drinkers are at risk of vision changes and even permanent eye damage. If you drink a lot in a single day, you may experience dizziness and blurry vision. Making heavy drinking a habit is never a good idea because there is a close correlation between the liver and the eyes. Every organ in your body is related, a reason why you should focus on your holistic health. It’s essential to get regular health checks and eye exams to keep track of your overall health. At Lumen Optometric, we offer comprehensive eye exams and dry eye treatment. Excessive Drinking and Your Vision Over time, drinking too much alcohol can cause brain damage. If your brain does not function properly, your vision may also suffer. You may have permanently blurred vision or double vision due to the weakening of eye muscles. When this happens, your reaction time may also decrease. Excessive drinking also compromises your peripheral vision and causes you to develop tunnel vision. This condition can make driving difficult because your eyes can’t react well to headlights. Another thing that alcohol can damage is your ability to distinguish contrast in colors. Moreover, too much drinking may also result in optic neuropathy, migraines, and rapid eye movements. At Lumen Optometric, we’re more than happy to assist with your eye care needs. We offer a wide range of services, including myopia management, orthokeratology, and neurolens treatment. Call us at or fill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

Women are particularly vulnerable to cataracts due to hormonal changes. As of writing this article, the only treatment for cataracts is surgery. During cataract surgery, the doctor will remove the cloudy lens and replace them with an intraocular lens or IOL. The exact cause of cataracts may be unknown, but many experts believe that oxidative stress can damage enzymes and proteins in the eye’s natural lens. As such, the best way to reduce cataract risks is to eat a healthy diet that consists of antioxidant chemicals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Lumen Optometric, a top provider of corneal reshaping services, recommends adding these foods to your everyday menu. Fruits and Vegetables According to research, you need five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day for optimal eye health. Choose organic fruits and vegetables. When eating them as is or adding them as an ingredient for meals, leave the skins on, as they are full of vitamins A, C, and E as well as lutein and zeaxanthin. Fruits and vegetables offer the highest total antioxidant capacity, so be sure to include them in your regular meals. Fish Another way to reduce the risk of cataracts is by eating foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids. This includes seafood such as shrimp, tuna, salmon, and trout. If your eye exam doctor tells you that you are at risk for cataract development, you can slow the progression by eating fish at least twice each week. This way, you nourish your eyes and protect your vision. Whole Grains Having three servings of 100% whole grains daily is a great way to prevent cataracts. This may include amaranth, quinoa, sorghum, or millet. While these grains seem unfamiliar to you, research some recipes and add something new to your diet. In addition to that, you should also read food labels carefully. Avoid white bread and bakery items that may contain refined grains and sugars and select minimally processed items. Nuts and Seeds Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects membranes of eye cells from radical damage. A few foods, including cooking oils, seeds and nuts, are exceptionally rich sources. Preserve the health of your eyes with the help of Lumen Optometric. In addition to comprehensive eye exams, we also provide prescription glasses and contact lenses.

Blog eye care How Long Does My Child Need ?How Long Does My Child Need ? June 1, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Introduction: As parents, one of the key concerns regarding our children’s vision is understanding how long myopia management is necessary. We often wonder when myopia progression might come to a halt and whether interventions are required indefinitely. In this blog post, we’ll explore this question and shed light on the factors influencing the duration of myopia management. Understanding the Age of Myopia Stabilization: A crucial aspect of determining the duration of myopia management is identifying the age at which myopia tends to stop progressing. However, this age can vary significantly among individuals and is influenced by various factors. These factors include the age of myopia onset, the intensity of near work, parental history of myopia, and lifestyle factors. Factors Influencing Myopia Stabilization: The age of myopia onset plays a significant role in predicting when myopia is likely to stabilize. Generally, earlier onset of myopia is associated with a higher likelihood of continued progression into adulthood. Additionally, the intensity of near work, such as prolonged hours spent studying or engaging in screen activities, can impact myopia progression. Parental history of myopia also serves as a crucial indicator. Children with one or both myopic parents are at a higher risk of developing and progressing myopia. These genetic factors contribute to the overall prognosis and duration of myopia management. Understanding Ocular Growth Charts: Ocular growth charts provide valuable insights into the projected age of stabilization for myopia. However, it’s essential to recognize that these projections assume relatively stable visual and lifestyle conditions. In reality, significant changes in visual demand can trigger a second phase of myopia progression even after years of stable presentation. Conclusion: In conclusion, the duration of myopia management for your child depends on various factors, including the age of myopia onset, intensity of near work, parental history of myopia, and lifestyle factors. While ocular growth charts offer insights into the projected age of stabilization, it’s crucial to consider the dynamic nature of myopia progression, especially in response to changes in visual demand.

October 7, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Your eyeglasses or contact lenses may seem like they’re still working perfectly, but they probably aren’t if you’ve had them for a while. In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses how often you should have your eye prescription updated. How Often Should You Update Your Eye Prescription? People have different eye care needs. Some need to have their eye prescription changed annually, while others won’t need to update theirs every three years. If you’ve been keeping up with routine appointments with your eye doctor, you’d already have an idea of how often you should update your eye prescription. Some factors affect how often a person should see their eye exam doctor and have their prescription updated. For many people, age and genetics are two such factors: if you have a family member who needs to update their prescription regularly, chances are you’ll be needing the same. Lifestyle is also another factor. For example, if you have a job that requires constantly facing a screen, eye strain can affect your vision over the long term. Signs That You Need to Update Your Eye Prescription Regular visits to your eye doctor can help determine how often you should update your prescription. The pandemic has made it difficult for people to see their eye doctor, but if you haven’t had an eye exam even before the quarantines began, then you should see one as soon as possible even more so if you’re experiencing one or more of the following: You’re having frequent headaches. Pain behind or around the eyes is a warning sign that your brain is trying to compensate for the change in your vision. While resting your eyes and taking pain medication can provide temporary relief, updating your eye prescription is a better long term solution. You’re often squinting. Squinting can help focus your vision and bring clarity. However, you shouldn’t have to not with an updated eye prescription. You’re having trouble reading signs from a distance. If your daily routine includes tasks that depend on clear vision such as driving, then an outdated prescription may put you at risk.

They occur when the shape of your eye prevents light from focusing correctly on your retina, or the light sensitive tissue layer found in the back of your eye. More than five million Americans suffer from refractive errors, impacting their quality of life. But the good news is that this vision problem can be corrected. The premier optometrist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares a quick overview of different refractive error types and their treatment. 1\\\\. Myopia. Also called ‘nearsightedness’, this particular refractive error makes it hard for people to see far away objects. Myopia happens when the eye is too long in the back, or when there’s a problem with the shape of the cornea (the clear front layer of the eyes) or the lens (the inner part of the eye that helps with focusing). 2\\\\. Hyperopia. To those with hyperopia, or ‘farsightedness”, nearby objects will appear blurry. This refractive error happens when the eyeball grows too short from front to back, or when the cornea or lens has a different shape than normal. Unlike those who suffer from myopia, which may develop in patients between the ages of 6 and 14, people with hyperopia are usually born with this vision problem. 3\\\\. Astigmatism. When a person has astigmatism, they’ll have trouble seeing both far away and nearby objects clearly. This is caused by a differently shaped cornea or lens, which makes light bend differently as it enters the eye. 4\\\\. Presbyopia. This type of refractive error affects middle aged and older adults. Presbyopia is an age related vision problem that makes it hard for people to see things up close because the eye lenses have become harder and less flexible, preventing light from focusing properly on the retina. How Refractive Errors are Treated Before a refractive error can be corrected, it has to be diagnosed accurately during a comprehensive eye exam performed by a trusted eye care professional like Lumen Optometric. Once the vision problem is diagnosed, it may be corrected using prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Myopia and hyperopia may also be fixed without the benefit of eyeglasses or contacts through orthokeratology. This safe, FDA approved and non surgical treatment involves the use of custom lenses that gently reshape the eyes as you sleep. Ask us more about this particular solution and determine whether this will be a viable option for you.

This type of glasses usually has a yellow tint and anti reflective coating. Also, lenses made with wavefront diagnostic technology can reduce glare, halos, starbursts and other aberrations that can distract your vision. Regular Eye Checkup Make sure to have your eyes checked by a specialist at least once every two years. If you have a significant eye condition or you have trouble with your eyes or vision, you may have to visit your eye doctor more frequently. Don’t hesitate to go for a checkup if you experience vision problems on the road at night. Your doctor may recommend that you take specialized testing, such as an evaluation of your visual field or contrast sensitivity, to determine what’s wrong and what can be done to improve your condition. Also, don’t neglect any treatments prescribed to you. If you need dry eye treatment or treatment of an eye disease, make sure to follow your doctor’s instructions. Other Tips Below are other simple ways to help ensure your safety while driving at night: Always keep your car windows clear so that you can have a good view of the road.Do not drive if you are tired or stressed. Driving requires focus.

It does not only strengthen and improve one’s physical abilities; it can also help boost a person’s mental sharpness, emotional health, and social skills. But due to the nature of various kinds of sports, risks of injuries are always present. One example of this is the risk of eye injury. That said, it is important to have the right gear and protective eyewear to keep your eyes safe. This is true for anyone, whether you are wearing glasses or contact lenses or not. By wearing the right eye protection, you can save yourself from eye injuries such as corneal abrasion, detached retina, eye socket fracture, and hyphema. Polycarbonate lenses are usually recommended for protective sports eyewear because they are impact resistant and shatterproof. They are also thinner and lighter than plastic and provide UV protection. Make sure that the polycarbonate lenses that you use meet or exceed the current sport specific ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International standards. In this post, corneal reshaping expert Lumen Optometric shares tips on how you can protect your eyes when playing different sports. Baseball and Softball Use helmet mounted faceguards that are approved by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE). Eye guards like goggles or spectacles are also recommended to minimize injury in case of a ball impact. Sports eye guards should be approved to ASTM F803 19 or the most current standard. Football Use a faceguard with a polycarbonate visor shield. The shield will protect against objects that can potentially penetrate openings in the faceguard grid. Soccer Use sports eye guards that have ASTM F803 19 approval. Basketball Use sports eye guards like goggles or spectacles that are approved to ASTM F803 19. Field Hockey Use sports eye guards that are approved to ASTM F2713 18 or the most current standard.

A dry eye treatment specialist shares some tips here. Preparing Is the First Step The first thing you should do to incorporate good eye care into your active lifestyle is to prepare ahead of time. Get a travel pouch that fits your contacts, solution, gels, etc. Do not forget to pack eye drops that can alleviate itchiness during the hayfever season or dryness caused by heavy air conditioning. Consider Switching to Disposable Contacts Sometimes, using weekly or even monthly contact lenses does not make it easy to live your active lifestyle, especially if preparing travel kits is not your thing. If this is the case, bring up the idea of switching to contact lenses that you can dispose of daily with your optician. However, this might not be a fitting option if you use scleral or other specialty lenses, says a scleral optometrist. Bring Your Sunglasses Overexposure to ultraviolet rays can lead to a host of eye related issues like cataracts or corneal sunburn, so it is important to take the right precautions to safeguard your vision from damage. Having a pair of sunglasses with you during travels is just as essential as having all your eye care accessories. Sure, contact lenses do provide protection against UVA and UVB, but unlike sunglasses, they do not fully cover your eyes including the skin on your lids.

In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses what causes dry eye syndrome, and how you can manage it if it happens to you. What Is Dry Eye Syndrome? Dry eye syndrome is characterized by dryness around the eyes, which may be accompanied by irritation, inflammation, or blurred vision. Anyone can experience these symptoms, however, discomfort is more pronounced for people who wear contact lenses, as lack of moisture increases friction between the eyes and the lenses. Dryness is usually caused by hormone changes, some autoimmune conditions, or damage to the tear glands or the skin around the eyes. Advanced age and certain types of allergies may also contribute to dry eye syndrome. Some types of contact lenses, when worn for long periods, can also cause dryness in the eyes. Managing Dry Eye Syndrome If you’re experiencing symptoms of dry eye syndrome, do not take any medication or try how tos that you may find online. Visit an eye exam doctor to determine its cause and plan treatment. One of the most common treatments for dry eye syndrome is taking lubricating eye drops, which are often prescribed for dryness caused by inefficient tear glands or very low humidity levels. If dryness is determined to be caused by the medication that you’re taking, your eye doctor may require changes to your prescription. Choose the Right Contact Lenses If dryness occurs when you wear your contact lenses, you don’t have to limit its usage or switch to eyeglasses if you’re not comfortable wearing one. The following are other types of contact lenses that are more suitable for people suffering from dry eye syndrome: Soft Contact Lenses These contacts are made of hydrogel, which contains water. Soft contact lenses are typically disposable, however, some manufacturers offer extended wear options that are reusable for up to 30 days. Silicone Based Hydrogel Contact Lenses These are functionally similar to hydrogel based contact lenses, but have better moisture retention. Gas Permeable Contact Lenses These contacts are relatively more rigid, but they let oxygen reach the eye. Orthokeratology contact lenses are made from a similar material.

However, by making a few lifestyle changes, you can lower your risk for these conditions. This Healthy Aging Month, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, shares tips on taking care of your aging eyes. Eat a Balanced Diet Make sure to include in your diet foods rich in eye friendly nutrients, such as Vitamin A (which helps protect the cornea, the surface of your eye) and Vitamin E (which prevent free radicals from damaging proteins in your eyes). Should You Take Supplements? Supplements can help prevent vitamin deficiencies, but they’re not a substitute for a balanced diet. If you’re considering taking supplements, consult your eye doctor. Undergo Routine Eye Exams How often should you have your eyes checked? As a general rule, those aged 40 and above should see their eye doctor at least once a year. What many patients don’t realize is that they don’t usually notice that their vision has deteriorated unless the change is abrupt or significant. That’s because your brain automatically adapts to any changes in your vision, sometimes tricking you into thinking there’s nothing wrong with your vision even though it has already deteriorated. Through routine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect changes in your vision before they significantly affect your lifestyle and prescribe treatment. For instance, they might give you a higher prescription for your contact lenses. Wear Sunglasses Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays can damage your vision and increase your risk for conditions such as cataracts or macular degeneration. To protect your eyes from UV damage, always wear sunglasses while you’re outside. In particular, we recommend wearing sunglasses with a shade of UV 400, which provide nearly 100% protection from UV rays.

That’s why parents are doing whatever they can to help their children successfully transition to the next academic grade. Below, we share our top tips for parents, so they can ensure that their child’s vision is a tool for success in school. 1\\\\. Balance Indoor and Outdoor Time Outdoor play offers numerous benefits, but many children aren’t getting enough of it. Most children spend much of their time indoors, whether in a classroom, at home, or in after school activities. Kids who regularly play outdoors have improved motor skills, feel more independent, and practice important social skills. But the main benefit of “outdoor time” that eye doctors like to focus on is the lower incidence of myopia (where distant objects appear blurry). Numerous studies published in journals like Ophthalmic Research and Review Of Optometry have shown that children who spend 1.5 2.5 hours per day outdoors during the daytime have a reduced risk of becoming myopic or, if they have myopia, it progresses at a slower pace. Sending your kids outside to play every day will help their vision, overall health, and contribute to academic success. 2\\\\. Encourage Your Child To Take Frequent Breaks Once the new school year begins, students are often busy with daily homework, reading assignments, and visually demanding recreational activities like video games. While all of these activities are important, they shouldn’t be done without periodic breathers. Eye strain is a real concern for the many students who spend hours in front of a book or screen and can put a damper on their grades. Minimally, have your child follow the 20 20 20 rule: every 20 minutes they should focus for 20 seconds on an object that’s at least 20 feet away. Even better, encourage slightly longer breaks for a snack in the sun, or a quick walk around the block to allow their eyes to focus on more distant objects. 3\\\\. Have Their Eyes Examined by an Optometrist Whether or not your child wears glasses, yearly eye exams will help ensure healthy visual development. It’s no surprise that children who don’t see well perform at a lower level than their peers. In some cases, young children aren’t even aware that their vision has changed, or they may not be able to verbally express it. At our practice, our eye exams go far beyond the standard vision screenings offered in school. We thoroughly check your child’s eye health and several visual skills, including visual acuity, focusing, tracking and teaming. If your child has myopia we will discuss if they are a candidate for myopia management. Myopia management treatments can slow or stop myopia in children and teens and doing so will minimize their risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life. 4\\\\. Filter Out Blue Light Now, more than ever, children’s eyes are focusing on screens of all shapes and sizes. While science hasn’t yet confirmed the damaging effects of blue light on a child’s eyes, one thing is certain: blue light exposure (especially in the evening) can lead to reduced sleep quality. Good quality sleep is crucial for cognitive and physical development, which is why many parents purchase blue light glasses or utilize blue light filters such as screens and software on devices. Blue light also contributes to digital eye strain, leading to symptoms like eye pain, headaches, blurred vision and dry eyes. If your child uses a tablet, smartphone, or computer before bedtime, speak with us about whether blue light glasses or lens coatings can help. Give your child the tools they need to succeed!

Blog eye care Is It Possible to Prevent Glaucoma?Is It Possible to Prevent Glaucoma? January 17, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Around 80 million people around the world have glaucoma. Interestingly, around half of the individuals with this eye problem aren’t even aware of it. This condition often shows no symptoms in its initial stages. It’s frequently called “sneak of the sight” because when not detected and treated early, it can cause irreversible vision loss. Learn if glaucoma is preventable from your local orthokeratology specialist. What Is Glaucoma? Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve or the nerve in the back of the eye. Its symptoms are usually not noticeable in its early stages. People often only notice changes in their vision once the condition has progressed. The only way to confirm if you have glaucoma is to get a comprehensive eye exam. While it has no cure, early treatment can help preserve your sight. Who Are at Risk? You can get glaucoma, regardless of your ethnicity and age. However, it’s more common in people over 60, African Americans over 60, and those with a family history of glaucoma. If you are at high risk of this eye condition, you might need to see your eye exam doctor every one to two years. Is It Preventable? While glaucoma isn’t preventable, it can be caught early through regular eye exams. Early detection and treatment go a long way in preventing significant or permanent vision loss. Eating nourishing meals has also been proven to be beneficial to eye health. Include leafy greens, colored fruits, berries and vegetables in your diet. Regular exercise can lower eye pressure, which is helpful for people with glaucoma. Even low intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is ideal for glaucoma patients. Quitting smoking and wearing UV blocking sunglasses are other ways to protect your eyes from the effects of this vision threatening eye condition. If you experience sudden vision changes, don’t wait long to schedule an eye exam. At Lumen Optometric, we provide more than prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses.

July 14, 2020 by Lumen Optometric COVID 19 has changed the way people move and interact in public spaces, influencing our personal hygiene and habits. For contact lens wearers, the “new normal” has put a question on their use of contacts. While contact lenses are generally a safe and effective form of vision correction for many people, concerns have grown as to whether it’s OK to continue using these lenses or not amid the pandemic. Since contact lenses are inserted and removed using one’s fingers, wouldn’t this pose a higher risk of coronavirus infection? According to recent research, there is no sufficient evidence suggesting that contact lens wearers have a higher risk of contracting COVID 19. Experts have also emphasized the importance of proper handwashing and good hygiene in order to prevent or reduce such risks. Lumen Optometric, a trusted expert in eye care and dry eye treatment, shares more tips below. Observe Proper Handwashing Before handling your contact lenses, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Afterwards, dry your hands with a clean towel or unused paper towels. If soap and water are not available, you can use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% of alcohol. Regularly Disinfect Contact Lenses Your scleral optometrist will also likely advise you to regularly disinfect your contacts if they are monthly or two week lenses. Make sure to follow the cleaning instructions of the manufacturer or your eye doctor. If you have disposable lenses, get rid of them properly every after use. Discontinue Wearing Contacts and Switch to Glasses if Sick If you are experiencing any COVID 19 symptoms or you have tested positive for COVID 19, it would be best to stop using your contacts and switch to glasses for the meantime. Take note, however, that wearing glasses cannot protect you against COVID 19 or prevent transmissions of the virus. Lumen Optometric is a local practice that offers top notch eye care services.

A myopic eye is one that grows too long front to back. We know this because we measure it using special equipment that calculates the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length, and with advanced equipment we can now measure this down to fractions of a millimeter. So myopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye – if a normal eye is shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye would more resemble a football. Portrait of boy working on team project in art class Once an eye is too long, there are currently no known treatments or cures which can cause the axial length of the eye to reverse. Refractive surgery performed on adults, such as LASIK, does not “shrink” the eye, but rather reshapes the front surface of the cornea to enable clear vision without corrective lenses. While the patient who has successful refractive surgery can now see clearly, they still have an elongated eye, so still have the risks associated with the disease. The Dangers of Having Myopia There are different types of myopia as well. If a child develops myopia at a young age, we know that they are at higher risk to develop high myopia and even pathological levels of myopia. High levels of myopia can lead to an increased risk for diseases of the eye such as retinal detachments, glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy. Unfortunately, those diseases can all lead to permanent vision loss. These life altering diseases are another layer of danger besides the obvious need for optical correction in glasses or contact lenses in order to see clearly. When you have pathological or degenerative myopia, other signs can form on your eyes that your eye doctor needs to monitor over time. Lattice degeneration and lacquer cracks of the retina all show signs that the retina is under duress because the eyeball has grown excessively long. Ask your doctor about these signs and other ones such as a tilted optic nerve head disc and choroidal neovascularization that happen exponentially higher in cases of extremely high levels of myopia. What are the Best Ways to Treat Myopia? The best treatment is to first prevent myopia if possible. More research is being conducted in this area, but as a general rule, eye doctors are encouraging at least two hours of outdoor activity per day. More outdoor activities under natural sunlight have been associated with a lower risk of developing myopia in the first place. If your children have to do intense studying or reading, it is recommended to do as much reading as possible when the sun has set versus reading during the day. Regular checkups with your eye doctor to diagnose myopia as early as possible are also critical. By catching myopia at an early age, there can be many different types of interventions to prevent myopia from worsening. Myopia typically begins in school aged children and can worsen until the leveling out usually in your mid twenties. As far as the visual component is concerned, usually, a pair of glasses or contact lenses are sufficient. Once the eyes have stopped growing, refractive surgery procedures can be employed as well. But keep in mind that simply correcting your vision will not stop your eyes from getting worse. The root cause of myopia, an eyeball that continues to grow excessively long during our youth, needs to be addressed. Special pharmaceutical agents such as atropine have been shown to slow down the progression of myopia considerably. Special contacts such as orthokeratology lenses worn at night are effective as well. Even soft contact lenses and glasses designed with special optics different from the traditional pair of glasses can be effective to slow down the rate of myopic progression. Custom Orthokeratology or Overnight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed contact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while sleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names for orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping system, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the curvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While initially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see more clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in reducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused in front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the optical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact lenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning and disinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper hygiene ‘ortho k’ is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating children of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that can be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to treat children with amblyopia, sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic progression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are being designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight contact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia by almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers throughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral retina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact lens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia as well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating Eyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a similar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is a particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact lenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s bodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of power in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial length elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids just like yours so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above are four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been diagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with a contact lens while sleeping.

January 1, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Routine visits to the eye doctor are necessary for maintaining the good health of your eyes. If you feel that there is something wrong with your vision or experiencing discomfort in your eyes, you must consult a specialist immediately. You can either go to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist if you have issues with your eyes. Read on to discover which eye exam doctor you should visit for your eye condition. Optometrists VS Ophthalmologists An optometrist attends optometry school for four years and usually do a year of residency. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist goes to medical school for four years and does a four year residency. Also, an ophthalmologist typically does a fellowship for one to two years. They can choose a specialty like glaucoma or pediatrics. Ophthalmologists will have an MD or DO following their name while optometrists will have an OD after their names. Who Should You Go To? Both optometrists and ophthalmologists can prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses. The main difference between the two professions is that an ophthalmologist performs surgeries while optometrists don’t. Ophthalmologists are surgeons who can also treat eye diseases. States may indicate which conditions optometrists can treat while ophthalmologists can treat all eye diseases. For eye exams and prescriptions, you can go to both eye doctors. Usually, an optometrist is the better option for those who need more contacts. On the other hand, those who need surgeries should consult an ophthalmologist. It’s the same for serious conditions like macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. For your eye care needs, you can depend on Lumen Optometric.

Both organizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia, and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life. What is Myopia? Myopia causes blurry distance vision, which can be compensated for with glasses or contact lenses to provide a child with clear vision. However, myopia is caused by an eye that is growing too long and, once started, myopia usually gets worse in children as the eye continues to grow abnormally fast. Higher myopia increases the lifetime risk of serious eye diseases such as retinal diseases and glaucoma. How Bad is the Myopia epidemic? In late 2019, the American Academy of Ophthalmology created a Task Force on Myopia, recognizing the importance of this growing disease in children and the potential lifelong impact myopia has on individuals and society. This task force identified priorities of educating other physicians, working with government agencies and health agencies, and educating parents and schools about this issue so that more proactive steps can be taken to help children. Treehouse Eyes Co founder, Matt Oerding, was recently interviewed about the prevalence of myopia alongside Dr. William Reynolds of the American Optometric Association and Dr. Emily McCourt, the chief of ophthalmology at Children’s Hospital Colorado.” Over the last two decades, there’s been an increase in myopia or nearsightedness worldwide, not just in the United States. And that corresponds with an increase in near devices, especially digital devices,” Reynolds said. Watch the full interview by clicking here. Myopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050. Can Myopia be Stopped? There is hope for parents, however, as several treatments are now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good candidate for treatment.

It’s estimated that the 700,000 workplace eye injuries that happen every year cost businesses roughly $934 million in combined productivity loss, health costs, fines, and employee compensation. That’s why employers are being encouraged to promote vision health among their employees this Workplace Eye Wellness Month. Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, shares eye care tips below: Remind Employees to Observe the 20 20 20 Rule While using a computer, you should take short breaks to allow your eye muscles to rest. Every 20 minutes, employees should look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Avoid Sitting Too Close to the Computer Screen A common myth is that you can develop myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) if you sit too close to the screen. However, this myth has been debunked by the fact the two vision conditions have strong genetic links. While sitting close to the screen won’t cause nearsightedness or farsightedness, it can increase digital eye strain. To prevent digital eye strain, the computer screen should be about 20 to 28 inches away from the face. However, if employees keep moving closer to the screen to see better, they should see an eye specialist as soon as possible. That’s because they may need a higher prescription for their eyeglasses or contact lenses. Adjust the Computer’s Display Settings Another way to reduce digital eye strain is to adjust the computer’s display settings to make it easier for your eyes to follow the text and see images. Adjust the computer display’s brightness to the same level as your workplace’s brightness, enlarge the font size for easier viewing, and reduce the color temperature to reduce the blue light the short wavelength visible light associated with increased eye strain emitted. Alternatively, employees can also wear computer glasses, which have yellow tinted lenses that block blue light. For more tips on reducing your exposure to blue light, consult your local eye doctor.

Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, with the symptom being blurry distance vision. Studies show that myopia rates in children are increasing as kids spend less time outdoors and more time involved in near work like digital device use. What many parents don’t know is that rapidly progressing myopia is more than just a hassle it can harm your child’s eye health. Children with progressive myopia are far more likely to develop potentially sight threatening eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration later in life. Given the growing prevalence of myopia in children the media are taking notice. There have been a number of articles recently about this issue in the New York Times, Women Fitness and more locally here in Bay Area Moms and Macaroni Kid. These articles have great tips for parents. We recommended kids get outside at least 2 3 hours a day and take frequent breaks from screen use to help their vision. We also offer new myopia treatments, including customized contact lenses and prescription eye drops, that we can use to treat myopia. Our practice specializes in providing these treatments and offers myopia consultations to customize a treatment plan for each child. What Causes Myopia to Progress? Genetics play a large role in myopia development. Two nearsighted parents are more likely to have a myopic child than a couple with only one myopic parent, or no myopic parents at all. No one knows exactly why myopia progresses, but spending most of the day indoors, focusing on near objects like screens and books, may be risk factors. More research is needed to determine whether the fact that children are spending less time looking at faraway objects like a moving baseball or a basketball net might be contributing to the increase in myopia cases around the world. How Can I Prevent Myopia From Worsening? One of the best pieces of advice for parents of nearsighted children is to increase their child’s outdoor playtime in the sun. In research studies, the progression of myopia was slower in children who spent a considerable amount of time in the sunshine than in children who did not. The World Health Organization advises that children under 5 spend 1 hour or less per day in front of a screen, and no screen time is recommended for infants under 1. The Children’s Eye Foundation recommends outdoor play daily, and no screen time for children under 2. They also recommend no more than 1 2 hours per day for 2 to 5 year olds, with frequent breaks. How Can a Eye Doctor Help? Myopia management eye doctors do more than prescribe corrective lenses. Although no actual cure for myopia exists, there are methods that can help control its progression. Like most treatments, myopia treatment in children is most effective when started early before a child is highly myopic.

This Wall Street Journal article featured Treehouse Eyes in a recent article discussing the growing issue of childhood myopia.

When it comes to their vision, early detection of issues like nearsightedness (myopia) is crucial for timely intervention and effective management. Myopia can impact a child’s academic performance, social interactions, and overall quality of life if left unaddressed. In this article, we’ll highlight key signs that parents should watch for to identify if their child may be experiencing nearsightedness. Frequent Squinting: One of the most common signs of nearsightedness in children is squinting. If you notice your child squinting often, especially when trying to see distant objects like road signs or the whiteboard at school, it could indicate that they are having difficulty focusing on distant objects. Sitting Close to the TV or Holding Devices Close: Children with nearsightedness may instinctively sit closer to the television or hold digital devices closer to their face to see more clearly. While occasional closeness to screens is common, persistent behavior of this nature could be a red flag for myopia. Complaints of Headaches or Eye Strain: Children experiencing nearsightedness may complain of frequent headaches or eye strain, particularly after engaging in activities that require focusing on distant objects for extended periods, such as reading or watching movies in a theater. Difficulty Seeing the Whiteboard or Screen at School: If your child consistently has difficulty seeing the whiteboard or screen in the classroom, despite sitting in the front rows, it could indicate nearsightedness. They may also struggle to recognize faces or objects from a distance. Rubbing Eyes Frequently: Excessive rubbing of the eyes can be a sign of eye fatigue or strain, which often accompanies nearsightedness. If you observe your child rubbing their eyes frequently, especially after engaging in activities that require visual concentration, it’s worth investigating further. Decline in Academic Performance: Unexplained declines in academic performance, particularly in subjects that require visual acuity like reading or math, may be attributed to undiagnosed nearsightedness. If your child’s grades suddenly drop or they express frustration with schoolwork, consider scheduling an eye exam. Family History of Myopia: Genetics play a significant role in the development of myopia. If one or both parents have myopia, there’s an increased likelihood that their children will also develop the condition. Keep this in mind and remain vigilant for signs of nearsightedness in your child, especially if there’s a family history. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia: Recognizing the signs of nearsightedness in your child early on is essential for proactive intervention and effective management. If you observe any of the aforementioned signs or have concerns about your child’s vision, don’t hesitate to schedule an myopia consultation with a Treehouse Eyes provider. Remember, addressing vision issues promptly can significantly impact your child’s overall well being and success in various aspects of life. Let’s work together to ensure our children’s vision remains clear for a bright future ahead.

It can help you sleep better by regulating your circadian rhythm. Studies show that daily and healthy exposure to sunlight can benefit the eyes of little ones. A local scleral optometrist explains why safe sun exposure is great for your children’s eyes. Sunlight and Your Kids’ Eyes Myopia or nearsightedness happens when the shape of the eye is too curved, keeping light from properly focusing on the retina. People who have it struggle to see distant objects. When not detected and treated early, it can affect a child’s performance in school and at play. Have you noticed that your child blinks or squints a lot? Do they often complain of headaches or that they can’t see the words on the board at school? If so, it’s best to schedule a visit with your local optometrist. These are typical signs of nearsightedness in children. At Lumen Optometric, we are here for your family’s vision correction and dry eye treatment needs. Moreover, research shows that children who spend time outdoors are less likely to develop this vision condition. Experts believe bright sunlight can aid in the retina’s production of dopamine, a hormone that can help regulate eye growth. Tips for Healthy Sun Exposure While natural light might benefit your child’s eyes, you should discourage them from looking directly at the sun. Like adults, they need to wear UV blocking sunglasses to keep their eyes safe from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. Even when it’s cloudy outside, you and your child should apply sunscreen and wear sunglasses. Wearing a wide brimmed hat can also reduce the UV rays that reach your little one’s eyes. Then, limit their time outdoors during the sun’s peak hours, which is from midday to early afternoon. Routine eye exams can help you keep track of your family’s vision and eye health.

It affects the cornea, or the clear layer that covers your eye’s iris and protects the pupil. Lumen Optometric discusses its causes, symptoms, and treatment. What Causes a Scratched Cornea? Anything that comes into contact with the clear surface of your eyes can lead to a corneal abrasion. Rubbing your eyes too hard can cause a scratched cornea, as well as a grain of dust or sand getting lodged on the front of your eye. Wearing contact lenses longer than is recommended and poking your eye accidentally can also lead to this type of eye injury. The risk of a scratched cornea increases when you experience dry eye syndrome. Being diagnosed with this condition makes it hard for you to sleep, since the eyelids may stick to the cornea. Upon waking up, your eyelids may tear a part of your cornea, resulting in a scratch or abrasion. What Are the Symptoms of a Scratched Cornea? Any eye injury, including a corneal abrasion, must be examined by your eye doctor. Visit them right away if you start experiencing any of these symptoms: Blurry vision.Eye pain that doesn’t resolve in minutes or hours.Feeling that something’s stuck in your eye.Foreign matter lodged in front of your eyes like dirt or small particles.Light sensitivity How Is Corneal Abrasion Treated? Before you visit your eye doctor, consider reducing the symptoms and the risk of infection. You can rinse the affected eye with saline solution to dislodge specks of dust or dirt. Try blinking several times as well to move the small particles from the cornea to the eyelashes. Your eye doctor will examine the affected eye and remove any objects they may find. To minimize discomfort during this prescription, they’ll apply anesthetic eye drops. They may prescribe you with eye drops to keep the eye lubricated and minimize infection and inflammation, as well as oral medication if you feel pain or light sensitivity. The healing time varies depending on how small or large the corneal abrasion is. Turn to Lumen Optometric for your immediate and ongoing optic needs.

These are among the many reasons seniors should see their eye doctor regularly. Learn more about the importance of senior eye care from a local scleral optometrist. Why Is Senior Eye Care Important? Individuals over 60 are more prone to eye diseases that can lead to irreversible vision changes. Many of these conditions do not manifest symptoms until they are in their later stages. Some of the most usual age related eye problems include cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Dry eye and retinal detachment are also common in seniors. Moreover, their early detection and treatment are crucial to preserve vision and improve quality of life. Quick Eye Care Tips for Seniors Schedule Routine Eye Exams Regardless of age, you must see your eye doctor regularly. Routine comprehensive eye exams can detect eye problems in their initial stages. Early treatment of vision threatening conditions is essential to preserving vision. Also, only an eye care specialist can trace changes in your vision. They can determine if you need dry eye treatment or new prescription eyewear. Make Indoor Spaces More Accessible Good lighting can enhance the safety of your living space. Place nightlights in hallways, bedrooms and hallways to reduce the likelihood of falling or tripping. To make rooms easier to navigate, consider having furnishings, walls and flooring in contrasting colors. For instance, light colored countertops make dark colored items easier to see. Eat Nourishing Meals Leafy greens, nuts, oily fish and citrus fruits are beneficial to eye health. Eat foods rich in zinc, omega 3 fatty acids, carotenoids, and vitamins A, C, and E. Meanwhile, minimize your consumption of foods high in saturated fats, sodium and sugar. Exercise Regularly Daily movement can improve blood circulation in your eyes.

Blog eye care Should You Go for Daily or Monthly Contact Lenses?Should You Go for Daily or Monthly Contact Lenses? October 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Cutting corners is never an option when it comes to proper eye care. As such, you’ll want to know which type of contact lenses best suit your needs and preferences, so it does its job while not getting in the way of your daily routine. However, with so many specific choices available, it can be a bit overwhelming to work out which type of lenses are best for your use. To help you determine your most preferred type of contact lenses, corneal reshaping expert Lumen Optometric has put together a quick comparison between daily and monthly contact lenses, and which is most ideal for your daily use. Daily Contact Lenses Also known as daily disposables, they come ready to insert in individual blister packs for one day use. When the day’s done and you’re about to sleep in for the night, just dispose of your lenses in the trash. When you wake up, you open another blister pack for a new pair. You don’t need to worry about cleaning or storing the lenses each time you use daily contact lenses since they’re disposable. They’re also generally very thin and have a high water content, and if you remove these contacts during the day for any reason, you’ll need to replace them with a fresh new pair. Monthly Contact Lenses These lenses are thicker and more durable than daily lenses because they have to resist drying out while you store and use them for 30 days. When you aren’t wearing them, you can store the contact lenses in a small two sided container with some contact solution. When using monthly contact lenses, you need to clean them to avoid infections and protein buildup. There are various contact solutions you can use to clean monthly lenses, and you should only use the ones recommended by your eye doctor. This is because different brands and types of solutions that use different chemicals can be incompatible and even destroy a contact they’re not designed for. Which is More Ideal for Your Use? The type of contact lenses you’ll use can actually depend on what your trusted eye doctor prescribes you. Your prescription might determine whether you choose monthly or daily contact lenses, but not all types of contacts are available for every prescription. For instance, if you need multifocal lenses, some are only available as monthlies. But if your prescription allows you to use both daily and monthly lenses, then you can consider which is better for your lifestyle. If your lifestyle makes it likely that something may get in your eye, then having daily disposables means you can just take out the lens and throw it out so you won’t have to bother with trying to clean the contact of any contaminants. This is especially handy if you work outdoors or don’t have easy access to facilities to clean and store your contact lenses. But if you have a controlled lifestyle and always have access to a washroom and mirror to remove and clean your lenses if needed, then monthlies could work better for your daily use.

Symptoms of Sunburned Eyes It can be hard to tell when your eyes are already being overexposed to the sun.

AMD typically occurs as aging causes damage to the macula, a part of the retina that controls sharp vision. While it does not cause total blindness, AMD makes it harder for people to perform their daily routines, such as reading, driving, or doing any close up work. In this article, Lumen Optometric, known for high quality eyeglasses and contact lenses, explains everything you need to know about AMD. What Are the Different Types and Symptoms of AMD? There are two types of AMD: dry and wet. Dry AMD, also called atrophic AMD, occurs when the macula gets thinner and progresses slowly over many years. It also has three stages: early, intermediate, and late. During the early and intermediate dry AMD stage, some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience mild blurriness in their central vision. On the other hand, wet AMD, also called advanced neovascular AMD, is a less common type of late AMD. It happens when abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, which eventually causes damage to the macula. As such, wet AMD causes faster vision loss. It’s important to note that any stage of dry AMD can turn into wet AMD, but wet AMD is always late. People with late AMD may notice straight lines looking wavy or crooked. They may also see a blurry area near the center of their vision, which may get bigger as time goes by. Some people report seeing blank spots or having trouble seeing in low lighting. If you experience any of these symptoms, be sure to see an optometrist immediately. How Do Doctors Diagnose AMD? One effective way to check if you have AMD is through an eye exam. Your eye exam doctor may also perform any of the following procedures to diagnose AMD successfully: Distance and near vision acuity testsDilated eye examination (which also includes using an ophthalmoscope) The pupil of your eye is dilated to allow your doctor to observe your macula at the inside back wall of the eye.Optical coherence tomography testing (OCT) To gain a clearer picture of your macula and its supporting layers, OCT generates high quality images of the eye.

It affects all of the systems of the body, including the eyes. The decrease in estrogen levels can alter one’s eyesight. Even the shape of the eyes undergoes a slight change, making it hard for women to wear contact lenses comfortably. Eye Conditions Associated With Menopause The following are some of the most common eye conditions that affect women during menopause: Dry Eyes – Women over the age of 50 have been shown to be at high risk of developing symptoms of dry eye syndrome such as blurred vision, light sensitivity and swollen or reddened eyelids. The decrease in hormone levels can also lower the salinity of the inner tear film and the oils of the outer tear film. Cataracts – Decreased hormone levels can also increase the risk for cataracts. Common signs and symptoms include seeing fading colors and halos around light sources and having difficulty seeing at night. Scheduling regular visits to your eye exam doctor can help detect this condition early. Glaucoma – This eye condition is also common in menopausal women. It leads to the damage of the optic nerve, usually from increased eye pressure. Early detection and treatment can help protect the eyes from vision loss associated with glaucoma. Eye Care During Menopause Taking a proactive approach is the best way to preserve your vision during your menopause years. In addition to annual eye exams, your eye doctor may recommend hormone therapy to restore your estrogen levels. While it may help reduce the risk of developing these eye conditions, patients who undergo such are four to seven times more likely to develop dry eye symptoms. Other ways to control menopause symptoms include a more natural approach like taking herbal supplements and consuming a diet rich in Vitamin D. Lifestyle changes can also help reduce dry eye symptoms like removing drafts and wearing wraparound sunglasses outdoors.

What is Myopia? Before you can defeat your enemy, you need to know exactly what it is. Myopia is a disease of the eye that is usually the result of an eyeball that has grown too long. We call how long the eyeball is the ‘axial length’. When the axial length grows excessively long, your vision will suffer in direct correlation. So any treatment we discuss has to show efficacy in its ability to reduce axial length elongation compared to a control group. Other times, the cornea may be too steep which can also cause myopia. However, for the sake of this article, we will address the major cause of myopia which is the excessive axial length of the eye. As when we talk about managing myopia, we will be talking about ways that have shown clinical evidence in slowing down axial length growth. Custom Orthokeratology or Overnight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed contact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while sleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names for orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping system, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the curvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While initially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see more clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in reducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused in front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the optical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact lenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning, and disinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper hygiene this is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating children of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that can be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to treat children with amblyopia, or sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic progression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are being designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight contact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia by almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers throughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral retina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact lens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia as well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating Eyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a similar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is a particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact lenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s bodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of power in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial length elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids just like yours so they can have their best shot at academic and social success!

But with so many of these conditions identified by the medical community, it can be hard to list down all of their possible effects on the eyes. Understanding the risk your specific autoimmune disorder poses to your vision is key to ensuring optimal eye health. Consult your eye doctor immediately if you start experiencing eyesight problems. In this blog, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye care center for neurolens® treatment, shares some of the autoimmune disorders that affect the eyes. Lupus It is a type of autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body, including the eyes. It can lead to eye related conditions like retinal vascular lesions and optic neuropathy. Symptoms may include blurred vision, sore or dry eyes, and light sensitivity. Rheumatoid Arthritis It is a chronic multisystem disease with musculoskeletal manifestations. While it primarily targets the hands, arms, legs and feet, this inflammatory disorder can also affect the eyes. Dry eye syndrome, however, is the most common eye condition to accompany rheumatoid arthritis. A visit to an eye doctor can help determine necessary dry eye treatment to alleviate discomfort. Other eye related conditions associated with rheumatoid arthritis include scleritis (inflammation of the white part of the eye) and uveitis (inflammation of the tissues in the eyewall). Multiple Sclerosis This autoimmune disorder affects the central nervous system. Given that the optic nerve is directly connected to it, an individual may be diagnosed with MS after the development of initial symptoms of vision problems. Optic neuritis, for instance, can bring a combination of color vision loss, blurred vision and double vision that usually affects only one eye.

Seeking a comprehensive eye examination after a concussion is crucial for several reasons, including the detection and management of vision problems that may arise as a result of the head injury. Continue reading as a trusted eye exam doctor further discusses the importance of having your eyes checked post concussion. Visual Disturbances and Concussions Concussions can lead to a range of visual disturbances, such as blurred vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia) and difficulty focusing. These symptoms may not be immediately apparent but can manifest in the days or weeks following the injury. A post concussion eye exam helps identify and address these issues, promoting a more effective recovery. Detecting Ocular Motor Dysfunction Concussions often affect the coordination of eye movements, known as ocular motor function. This can result in difficulties with tracking objects, maintaining focus or experiencing eye strain. A specialized eye examination can pinpoint ocular motor dysfunction, guiding the implementation of targeted therapies to improve eye coordination and alleviate associated symptoms. Assessing Binocular Vision Problems Binocular vision problems, where the eyes struggle to work together seamlessly, are common after concussions. This can lead to double vision, depth perception challenges and discomfort. Through a comprehensive check, an eye doctor can assess binocular vision problems and recommend appropriate interventions, such as vision therapy or corrective lenses. Addressing Light Sensitivity Photophobia is a frequent symptom post concussion. Exposure to light can exacerbate headaches and discomfort, whether you’re wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses. Optometrists can evaluate the extent of light sensitivity during an eye exam and recommend strategies to manage it effectively. This may include specialized lenses or advice on controlling lighting environments. Preventing Prolonged Visual Symptoms Early detection and intervention are key to preventing prolonged visual symptoms after a concussion. Without proper assessment and treatment, visual issues may persist and impact daily life. Timely eye exams can identify underlying problems and enable the implementation of targeted therapies, promoting a smoother recovery process. Lumen Optometric is a trusted eye specialist in the area.

But regular eye tests are not just about getting an occasional check up when things seem “off.” Instead, yearly eye tests are essential to catch any potential issues early and ensure optimal eye health. Why Eyesight Is Crucial for Education Eye health can deeply affect your child’s academic progress. In fact, roughly 80% of learning during a child’s first 12 years involves the use of the eyes. Vision problems may inevitably lead to challenges in reading, writing and even social activities. The Eye as a Health Indicator Beyond vision, an eye exam can be a window to your child’s overall health. Vision problems can hint at other health issues, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. In some cases, an eye exam can be the first step in diagnosing such conditions. The Benefits of Early Detection As with most health problems, catching eye issues early makes a big difference. For instance, certain corrective measures work best when started early. Identifying eye concerns early helps avoid potential complications and ensures your child’s vision is not adversely impacted. Why a Yearly Exam Is Necessary Regular eye exams are vital in monitoring vision changes and intervening promptly when necessary. While basic screenings in school can help flag significant problems, they don’t compare to a comprehensive exam by a professional optometrist. They go beyond reading charts to examine the eye’s health and ensure anomalies are treated before they become more serious. Schedule Your Child’s Eye Exam at Lumen Optometric Annual eye exams for kids offer a way to safeguard their academic success, ensure their eyes are developing as they should, and even act as a preventive health measure.

(While staring at a computer screen, you tend to blink less often. This increases the risk of dry eye because blinking is how a tear film which helps keep your eyes moist is spread across the surface of your eye.) However, recent studies have shown that having diabetes mellitus increases your risk for dry eyes. Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, explains how diabetes and dry eyes are connected and elaborate on the possible treatment options below: How Diabetes and Dry Eyes Are Connected Some medical researchers believe diabetic neuropathy can explain the connection between diabetes and dry eyes. Neuropathy happens when some of the nerves are damaged. It’s also a risk factor for lacrimal gland dysfunction. If the lacrimal gland (which secretes the watery component of the tear film) is damaged, tear production decreases. This, in turn, increases a patient’s risk for dry eyes. Important: Diabetes is just one of several factors that can increase your risk for dry eyes. Other factors include age (it’s not uncommon for people aged over 65 to experience dry eyes) and environmental conditions (tears evaporate more quickly in dry climates). If you have any of the aforementioned risk factors, you should undergo an eye exam at least once a year. Through routine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect and treat eye conditions before they progress or give higher prescriptions for contact lenses before blurry vision interferes with your daily routines. How Are Dry Eyes Treated Your eye doctor may recommend the following treatment options: Artificial tears – To alleviate the symptoms of mild or moderate dry eyes, you may need to apply artificial tears several times during the day. Eye inserts – An eye insert resembles a grain of rice and releases lubrication as it dissolves. It is placed between your lower eyelid and your eyeball.

Since their early invention, contact lenses have progressed a long way, transitioning from glass to hard plastic and finally to the soft materials we use today. In this blog post, we’ll delve into how exactly contact lenses are made and how manufacturers have revolutionized the way they are produced by harnessing modern technology and materials. The Foundation: Materials and Molding The journey begins with selecting the base material. Soft contact lenses are typically made from hydrogel or silicone hydrogel, which are chosen for their oxygen permeability and biocompatibility. These materials allow your eyes to breathe, which is essential for healthy wear. Rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, on the other hand, prioritize oxygen permeability even further. They are primarily made from highly durable and breathable plastics like fluoropolymers combined with silicone. Once the material is chosen, the lenses undergo a molding process to achieve their final shape. Here’s where the methods differ. Soft Contact Lenses Soft contact lenses are made through spin casting or lathe cutting process. Spin casting involves depositing liquid plastic into molds and then spinning them until the plastic takes the desired shape. Lathe cutting, meanwhile, involves carving the plastic into lens form. Computer controlled tools meticulously sculpt the lens from a disc of material. Both methods lead to polishing for comfort and hydration before reaching your eyes. Rigid Gas Permeable Lenses RGP lenses prioritize oxygen permeability, which is crucial for healthy corneal function. Their shaping process utilizes lathe cutting, which offers greater precision for intricate designs. It meticulously sculpts the lens design from the disc, similar to a woodworking lathe but with incredible accuracy. This allows for intricate shapes and sharper edges. RGP lenses can have complex curves and features to address specific vision needs, like astigmatism. Lathe cutting enables these intricate geometries. Additionally, precise cutting ensures clean and sharp edges on the lens, which is necessary for optimal tear flow and lens stability in the eye. Shaping and Finishing Touches Following the molding stage, both soft and RGP lenses undergo additional processes to ensure comfort and clarity. Polishing: Lenses are polished to achieve a smooth and comfortable surface for wearers. This step is essential for both soft and RGP lenses to minimize irritation. Hydration (Soft Lenses Only): Soft contact lenses are bathed in a sterile solution to absorb water and achieve their characteristic flexibility. This step is not required for RGP lenses. Quality Control and Packaging Every lens, soft or RGP, undergoes rigorous inspection for any defects or imperfections. This enables your scleral optometrist to provide you with only the highest quality lenses. Finally, the lenses are packaged in sterile blisters filled with saline solution. This solution keeps soft lenses hydrated and all lenses ready for use. Advanced Types of Contact Lenses Today, advancements in eye care have led to the development of customized contact lenses for specific eye conditions. For example, specially crafted lenses can now be made for irregularly shaped corneas. Additionally, advancements in materials have led to extended wear options for both soft and RGP lenses, allowing comfortable wear for extended periods. If you are undergoing dry eye treatment, be sure to work closely with your eye doctor to find the best solution for your vision needs. Get Your Lenses From Lumen Optometric Today The manufacturing process of contact lenses is a complex and precise dance of science and technology, catering to the specific needs of soft and RGP lenses. The next time you pop in your lenses, take a moment to appreciate the incredible journey they’ve taken to help you see the world clearly and comfortably.

These lenses offer a smooth transition between distances, eliminating the need for multiple glasses. They can also help treat other eye conditions. However, progressive lenses have pros and cons like any vision correction option. In this article, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of progressive lenses to help you decide whether they are the right choice for you. Pros of Progressive Lenses Here are some of the benefits of progressive lenses. Improved Vision Progressive lenses provide a more seamless transition between different prescriptions, allowing for clearer vision at all distances. Wearers can see objects at varying lengths without switching glasses or straining their eyes. Greater Comfort Progressive lenses eliminate the visible lines that come with traditional bifocals or trifocals. This makes them a more comfortable option for extended wear, particularly for activities like driving or using a computer. More Natural Vision Progressive lenses provide a more natural visual experience than traditional bifocals or reading glasses. This is because they offer a gradual change in prescription, mimicking how the eyes naturally adjust to different distances. Improved Aesthetics With no visible line, progressive lenses provide a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. This appeals to those who want to avoid the stigma of traditional bifocals or reading glasses. Cons of Progressive Lenses Despite their many advantages, there are drawbacks to progressive lenses. These include the following: Cost Progressive lenses can be more expensive than traditional bifocals or reading glasses because they require more advanced technology. This can be a barrier for those on a budget or without insurance coverage for vision correction. Adaptation Period Adjusting to progressive lenses can take some time. This can cause some initial discomfort or disorientation. Reduced Peripheral Vision Since progressive lenses have a narrow corridor of clear vision, wearers may experience reduced peripheral vision. This can be a safety concern, especially when driving or navigating unfamiliar environments. Increased Risk of Glare Progressive lenses can create more reflections and glare, particularly in bright light conditions. This can be an issue for those outdoors or in environments with bright lighting. How to Adapt to Progressive Lenses When adapting to progressive lenses, allow a few days for your eyes to get used to your new lens prescription. Practice focusing on familiar objects that are located at different distances from you so you can easily switch between far and near vision when needed. Patience also goes a long way in getting used to progressive lenses. To be sure that progressive lenses are right for you, schedule a consultation at Lumen Optometric.

As a parent, you also want to make sure that your child can see well enough to do the things they enjoy doing. Pediatric optometrists are specialized healthcare professionals who care for the visual and ocular needs of infants, children, and teens. In this article, we will discuss some factors you must consider when choosing an optometrist for your children. Location Location is essential when choosing the best optometrist for kids near you. If your child has a busy schedule, it may be more difficult for them to travel long distances to get to their appointments. Maybe you’re unsure about how far away from home an office is. Ask the doctor or staff if they have any recommendations on other practices they could recommend that might better suit your needs. Call ahead if multiple offices are within driving distance of your home. Make sure each office offers the same services before making an appointment with them. Experience The experience of an optometrist for children is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing the best eye doctor for kids. An excellent way to gauge this is by asking how long they’ve been practicing optometry and whether they have additional training relevant to your child’s specific needs (such as myopia management). Treehouse Eyes provides expert pediatric myopia care and ensures this with accessibility to Treehouse AMP, a video based parent education platform. Treehouse Eyes doctors are always willing to answer any questions regarding myopia and while also cultivating a kid friendly office experience. Recommendations The best way to find a pediatric optometrist you can rely on and who will get along well with your child is through referrals and recommendations. If you know someone who had a positive experience with an eye doctor, find out who they used and why they thought so highly of them. Consider that some of your friends have young children of their own. Before choosing which practice is best for you and your family, it might be useful to know what kind of experiences other people have had there. If no one in your family or circle of friends can personally recommend an optometrist, look online for reviews of nearby practices. You can also use the Google Maps business filter by typing “optometrist for children near me” into the search bar. You can add whatever city or town you live in and see the reviews. This should bring up several options nearby where children receive treatment from professionals specializing in vision care issues explicitly related to young people (such as myopia). Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor. Schedule a consultation now to find out more.

The right glasses are comfortable and give you sharp vision throughout the day. Despite the dependability of this eyewear, it can still cause spots or pimples to form on your face. Fortunately, there are several ways to avoid this issue. Here’s what you can do to prevent breakouts from wearing eyeglasses. Clean Your Glasses Frequently The pressure that eyeglasses put on your skin is what usually causes acne. It prevents dead skin cells from shedding, causing them to clog your pores and form pimples. If you have oily skin or wear thick layers of makeup, you are more likely to get breakouts from eyeglass wear. Regularly cleaning your eyeglasses will help prevent breakouts. You can use an alcohol wipe to clean them, focusing on areas that touch your skin. Have Your Glasses Adjusted Does it feel like your glasses are so heavy or pushing too hard on your nose? Excessive pressure from your glasses can contribute to breakouts. If this is the case, see your eye doctor and have your eyeglass frame adjusted. In some cases, replacing the nose bridges allow more even pressure distribution. Give Your Face a Break from Eyeglasses When you wear eyeglasses every day, it’s easy to forget that you even have them on. While they give you sharper vision, it helps to take breaks from wearing them from time to time. It relieves the pressure on your face that often contributes to breakouts. Remove Your Makeup at the End of the Day Thoroughly remove your makeup at the end of the day. Cosmetic products can accumulate under your glasses, increasing the likelihood of acne. Using makeup remover before cleansing ensures that you’re really getting rid of the products on your face. Don’t wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor.

Without proper treatment, vision problems can affect a child’s learning, increase the risk of permanent vision loss and even lead to behavioral issues. The American Optometric Association strongly recommends your little one see an eye exam doctor yearly. This Healthy Vision Month, we are sharing tips on taking a proactive approach to your child’s eye health. Avoid Excess Screen Time At least two screen time increases the risk of obesity, mood swings, aggressive behavior and obesity in children. The blue light from digital devices can contribute to digital eye strain. This eye condition is usually characterized by blurred vision, dry eye, headaches, and neck and shoulder pain. According to the Department of Health, children below two should have no screen time because it can affect physical and language development. Schedule Regular Eye Exams It’s a common misconception that you only need to see an eye care specialist if you need to update your contact lenses or eyeglasses. Regular eye exams can detect and treat eye conditions early in adults and children. If you see your child constantly squinting, tilting their head, or rubbing their eyes, schedule an appointment with your eye doctor immediately. These are common signs of vision problems in young individuals. Prepare Well Balanced Meals Incorporating leafy greens and foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids in your daily meals is beneficial to the entire family’s eye health. Vitamin A in leafy greens can lower the risk of dry eye syndrome, while omega 3 fatty acids can lower the risk of cataracts and age related macular degeneration. It’s also a good idea to consume fruits rich in vitamins C and E, such as pineapples, oranges, strawberries and mangoes. These vitamins can help restore tissues in your eyes and prevent infections. Moreover, an overall balanced diet is essential in preventing obesity and hypertension, which contribute to several eye diseases. At Lumen Optometric, we are committed to restoring your vision and helping you maintain good eye health. We offer a wide range of services, including corneal reshaping therapy, myopia treatment and neurolens therapy. Call us at or fill out our contact form to request an appointment.

Protecting your eyes from the sun’s damage is crucial to maintaining good eye health and preventing problems down the road. This blog post discusses the risks of UV exposure and provides you with practical tips for keeping your eyes safe from the sun’s harmful effects. Understand the Risks of UV Exposure UV exposure can have both short term and long term effects on your eyes. In the short term, you may experience photokeratitis, also known as “sunburn of the eye,” or pterygium, a growth on the white of the eye. Long term damage includes cataracts and macular degeneration. Some individuals are at higher risk for UV related eye problems, such as outdoor workers and those with light colored eyes. Choose the Right Sunglasses The right pair of sunglasses can play a significant role in protecting your eyes from UV damage. Look for sunglasses labeled with 100% UVA and UVB protection. Lens color and tint can also make a difference. Gray, green and brown lenses can help maintain color recognition. Consider polarized lenses to reduce glare, especially if you spend a lot of time near water or snow. Wraparound frames offer added protection by shielding your eyes from sunlight entering from the sides. Wear a Wide Brimmed Hat A wide brimmed hat can provide additional protection from indirect sunlight. By reducing your exposure to harmful UV rays, you can lower the risk of eye damage. Schedule Regular Eye Exams Early detection and prevention are essential to maintaining good eye health. Regular visits to an eye exam doctor can help you monitor changes in your vision and eye health. Comprehensive exams can catch problems early, giving you the best chance for successful treatment. Consider Protective Contact Lenses For contact lens wearers, UV blocking contact lenses can offer an added layer of protection against the sun’s harmful rays. Consult an optometrist to determine which type of contact lenses are best suited for you. Explore Orthokeratology Orthokeratology or ortho k, is a treatment that involves wearing specially designed contact lenses overnight to reshape the cornea. This non surgical procedure can help reduce the risk of UV damage to the eye and improve vision. Take Precautions During Peak Sun Hours Avoiding direct sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. can help protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. If you must be outdoors during these hours, seek shade whenever possible. Educate Children on Eye Protection Teaching children about the importance of eye protection from a young age is crucial for maintaining their long term eye health. Encourage kids to wear sunglasses and hats when outdoors to shield their eyes from the sun. Protecting your eyes from UV damage is essential for maintaining good eye health. By understanding the risks and taking the necessary precautions, you can reduce your chances of developing UV related eye problems.

Around 30% of teenagers, 9% of kids in school, and 5% of preschoolers have it. If both of a child’s parents are nearsighted, the child is more likely to have myopia. Myopia is generally on the rise, particularly in children. Experts believe that it might have something to do with spending more time indoors playing video games and using electronic gadgets. Read on to learn about some of the best myopia treatment options for children. The Development of Myopia When a child’s eyeball grows too rapidly relative to the usual pace of eye growth, myopia occurs. It may also develop if the cornea, the transparent window in front of the eye, curves too sharply. Light rays are unable to reach the retina when they enter the eye, which makes nearby objects look clear and distant objects look blurry. Treating Myopia in Childhood Although it cannot be cured or reversed, myopia can be managed and treated. The treatment’s objectives are to strengthen your child’s vision and stop it from deteriorating. Managing myopia is crucial for maintaining their eye health. Treatment Options to Combat Myopia Progression: Specialized Contact Lenses: Customized multifocal contact lenses are tailored to address myopia progression by slowing down eye growth in some children. Additionally, orthokeratology, also known as Ortho K, offers a unique solution by reshaping the cornea overnight, thus ensuring clearer vision throughout the day. Low Dose Atropine Eye Drops: Children may benefit from the use of low dose atropine eye drops, similar to those administered during routine eye examinations. This treatment approach has shown promise in managing myopia progression effectively. Increasing Outdoor Time: Encouraging children to spend more time outdoors can help counteract the onset and progression of myopia. Balancing screen time with outdoor activities is vital for safeguarding their eye health as they continue to grow. Consultation with a Treehouse Eyes Provider: For parents unsure about the most suitable treatment option for their child, consulting with a qualified optometrist is essential. Optometrists with myopia management expertise can provide personalized recommendations and guidance tailored to each child’s specific needs and circumstances. In conclusion, addressing myopia in children requires a comprehensive approach focused on effective treatment strategies and proactive management techniques. By leveraging innovative solutions and collaborating with eye care professionals, parents can ensure optimal vision health for their children both now and in the future. If you’re not sure which treatment would be the best choice, consult your optometrist to determine how you can manage your child’s myopia.

This eye condition can cause cloudy or blurred vision and increased light sensitivity. Patients may also experience poor night vision or notice that colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. While cataracts usually occur in older adults, this eye condition can happen to anyone. A local scleral optometrist shares the different types of cataracts. Types of Cataracts Age Related Cataracts Cataracts can occur due to the changes in your eyes as you age. You’re more prone to age related cataracts if you drink alcohol excessively, smoke cigarettes, take steroids and have diabetes. A family history of this eye condition and past eye surgeries also increases your risk for this eye condition. Congenital Cataracts Some people are born with cataracts or develop them in the first year of life. It’s not common for children to have cataracts. If your child’s cataracts are large enough to impact vision, immediate treatment is necessary to avoid further eye problems, like amblyopia or lazy eye. Traumatic Cataracts Blunt and penetrating eye injuries usually cause traumatic cataracts. This form of cataract may develop immediately or years after the eye injury. Secondary Cataracts There is a chance for scar tissue to develop in the eye after cataract surgery. If this happens, your vision will become cloudy again. Secondary cataracts are more common than you think and occur in two out of five people who get cataract surgery. A quick and non invasive procedure called YAG laser capsulotomy is the typical treatment for this type of cataract. Patients usually gain normal vision a few days following treatment. How Are Cataracts Diagnosed? Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial for the early detection of vision threatening conditions like macular degeneration and cataracts. Individuals older than 60 should schedule a dilated eye exam every one to two years. During your appointment, your eye care provider will use dilating eye drops to widen your pupil and check for signs of cataracts and other eye issues. Your doctor might also perform a refraction test, ophthalmoscopy and slit lamp test. These tests will help them determine if you need new prescription glasses or dry eye treatment. How Are Cataracts Treated? If you have cataracts, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. In the initial stages of this eye condition, prescription glasses or contact lenses can help improve vision. You can also use brighter lights in your home and wear anti glare sunglasses outdoors. Moreover, your eye doctor will recommend surgery if cataracts are starting to disrupt your daily tasks. You don’t need to wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor. Leave your eye care needs to Lumen Optometric. Besides comprehensive eye exams, we also offer neurolens treatment, scleral lenses and orthokeratology.

In this article, eye care specialists take a look at profiles of patients who may need extra UV eye protection. Construction Workers: Construction workers and other people who work outdoors are exposed to 10 20% more UV light than the average indoor worker. Even if a worker wears a hat outside, the brim can only block their eyes from overhead UV light and not the indirect UV radiation that is reflected on low level surfaces. Outdoor Enthusiasts: Outdoor enthusiasts such as cyclists and hikers spend a lot of time in the sun, thus requiring some protection from UV. Boaters and beachgoers should also equip themselves with eye protection because dry sand can reflect more than 15% of UV light while sea foam can reflect up to 30%. Children: Some kids tend to spend more time outdoors than adults. Long term effects of sun damage are cumulative. The longer children are not protected from the harmful rays of the sun, the more likely they will suffer damage to their eyes in their older years. Contact Lens Wearers: Some patients who wear contact lenses do not bother to wear sunglasses because their contacts block UVA UVB. While there are lenses that protect from UV radiation, they do not cover everything. The skin of the lids and brow bone are left vulnerable and should be covered with a pair of sunglasses. Health Conscious Individuals: If you are conscious about your health, you want to minimize your day to day interaction with environmental hazards. Aside from eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, safeguarding your eyes from UV radiation should be on your priority list, especially if you have a family history of age related macular degeneration.

As such, the process of making prescription lenses involves several steps. Continue reading to learn about prescription lenses, how they are made and the different types available. What Are Prescription Lenses? Prescription lenses are tailored spectacles that correct or improve the wearer’s vision. A dedicated optometrist assesses the unique needs of your eyes and prescribes lenses that adjust how light gets into your eyes, helping you see better. The Process of Making Prescription Lenses Making prescription lenses involves several steps, from the initial eye examination to the final fitting of the lenses into the frames. Here is a general overview of the process. Eye Exam The process begins with an eye examination by an eye doctor. During the exam, they will determine your specific vision prescription, which includes measurements for each eye, such as sphere power (for nearsightedness or farsightedness), cylinder power (for astigmatism) and axis (the orientation of astigmatism correction). If you have presbyopia, your doctor may also determine your reading prescription. Eye exams can also check for eye diseases so your doctor can prescribe the appropriate solution. For those with special eye conditions, you may need to see a specialist, such as a scleral optometrist, to get the treatment and visual clarity your eyes need. Lens Crafting After the examination, your optometrist sends the prescription to a lab where your lenses will be crafted. Here, a machine cuts the lens into the shape advised by your optometrist based on your prescription’s specifications. Lens Finishing Lastly, your lenses undergo additional treatments. These can include anti reflective or scratch resistant coatings, color tints, or UV protection. These coatings improve the clarity and durability of your lenses. Types of Prescription Lenses There are various types of prescription lenses available to correct vision problems and suit individual needs. These lenses are typically used in eyeglasses and may include single vision lenses, with a single prescription power throughout the entire lens. They correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. Bifocals have two different prescription powers in a single lens. The upper part corrects distance vision, while the lower is for near vision. They are commonly prescribed for individuals who have difficulty seeing both up close and at a distance. This condition is often seen in people over 40 with presbyopia. There are other specialty lenses available for specific needs, such as sports goggles and lenses for low vision individuals. The type of prescription lens you need depends on your vision correction requirements and lifestyle. An eye care professional will assess your vision and recommend the most suitable lens type for your needs. Lumen Optometric is one of the area’s leading eye specialists.

July 7, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Occasional headaches can be manageable for some people. But when these headaches begin to affect your eyesight or if your vision problems start coinciding with headaches, it can be a lot harder for anyone to bear. In this post, Lumen Optometric a trusted provider of eyeglasses and contact lenses discusses how headaches and vision can be interconnected. Types of Headaches That Can Affect Your Vision Migraines and cluster headaches are the usual types of headache that can affect your vision. Migraines are often described as intense pain in and around the eyes. A “migraine aura” usually precedes them, and it often resembles flashing lights, a prismatic rainbow of lights, or a zigzag pattern of shimmering lights. Meanwhile, cluster headaches usually occur in clusters and cause pain around the eyes. The pain typically radiates down the neck including the shoulders and comes with other symptoms like red eyes, changes in pupil size, eyelid droop, and nasal drainage. Vision Problems That Can Trigger Headaches Headaches caused by vision problems usually start when the eyes are overworked and you can’t maintain focus. Make sure to visit an eye exam doctor if you are experiencing any of the following: Eye Strain – This is common among people who work in front of digital screens for several hours and so they tend to overuse the focusing muscles of their eyes. When eye muscles become fatigued, a headache can be felt specifically around or behind the eyes. Farsightedness – A frontal headache or brow ache may occur if a person is farsighted. Farsightedness can make it difficult for a person to focus on nearby objects, making it possible for eye strain and headaches to develop. Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma (AACG) – A rare type of glaucoma, it causes the eye pressure to rise quickly and often results in eye pain, eye redness, cloudy vision, and an onset of headaches.

In fact, any changes to your vision should always be taken seriously lest they become serious. Vision changes refer to any alterations in your ability to see properly–and they are caused by a great number of things. The premier expert in neurolens treatment, Lumen Optometric, discusses vision changes and what you should know about them. What Causes Vision Changes Vision changes may stem from the eyes themselves or may be caused by many different conditions that affect the entire body. The most common reasons for these alterations are refractive errors, including myopia or nearsightedness and presbyopia or age related farsightedness, which affects your ability to focus on objects at a specific distance. And while anyone can suffer from vision changes, the elderly are more prone to them because of possible chronic conditions that affect eyesight. Aside from refractive errors, the following conditions may cause changes in your vision: Age related macular degeneration.Cataracts, or the clouding or loss of transparency in the lens of the eye.Dry eyes, which may be caused by blocked tear ducts, and will require dry eye treatment.Retinal detachment.Eye infections, such as pink eye or sty.Injuries to the eye because of work related accidents or otherwise. Symptoms of Vision Changes Any changes in your vision should be dealt with promptly to prevent eye conditions. When overlooked, these can lead to possible vision loss.

February 11, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Whether you’re working in a desk job or you’re attending online classes, there’s a big possibility that you keep looking at a computer screen for hours on end. As such, you may experience migraines from time to time. Migraines can cause slight discomfort and may even affect your vision and ability to see clearly. There are two types of migraine you might have heard of: visual and ocular. While both migraines involve changes in your vision, there are ways to tell them apart. Lumen Optometric, known for quality dry eye treatment services, explains the difference between visual and ocular migraines. Visual Migraine Visual migraine is a temporary visual impairment that may occur simultaneously in both eyes. Most visual migraines last for 30 minutes, but depending on your stress levels and overall health, they may last longer. You may also experience a migraine headache shortly after a visual migraine. The symptoms of visual migraine may vary. These include: Flickering blind spot in the center or near the center of your peripheral fieldA wavy or zigzag ring of colored light surrounding a blind spotA blind spot that slowly migrates across your line of vision If you frequently experience any of these symptoms, you should consider contacting your optometrist for a neurolens treatment. Ocular Migraine Ocular migraine, on the other hand, is a rarer type of migraine. Unlike visual migraine, ocular migraine only affects one eye. It causes temporary loss of vision, which occurs when there is reduced blood flow in the eye. Ocular migraines can also be triggered because of blood vessel spasms in the retina. It typically lasts for about an hour, and vision eventually returns. In addition, the most common symptom of ocular migraine is the appearance of a blind spot. This blind spot affects your field of vision and normally appears first in the center. As the migraine worsens, the blind spot grows and gradually blocks your entire field of vision. A migraine headache may also occur before, during, or after you experience ocular migraine. Visual and ocular migraines are usually nothing to be worried about, and they will resolve themselves within an hour or less. Nevertheless, if these types of migraine headaches persist, be sure to book an appointment with your eye doctor. Are you looking for a professional scleral optometrist in your area?

Blog eye care VR Headsets: Are They Bad for the Eyes?VR Headsets: Are They Bad for the Eyes? October 14, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Virtual reality (VR) headsets are becoming more commonplace and are now being used for applications other than gaming and entertainment. Since VR headsets deliver audiovisual content, Lumen Optometric takes a look at whether or not VR headsets are bad for the eyes. How Do VR Headsets Work? VR headsets are head mounted devices that consist of a display screen and stereo earpieces, as well as sensors and controllers that create an interactive and immersive experience. Putting on a VR headset shuts out the immediate surroundings, which means the user can only see the content projected on the display screen. Its sensors adjust the content orientation, which allows the user to interact with a virtual space from any direction. While mostly known for their gaming applications, VR headsets can also be used for work and education. The Effects of VR on the Eyes Similar to devices that deliver audiovisual content like TVs and smartphones, VR headsets present the same risks, including eye strain and fatigue, discomfort, and blurred vision. Studies have shown that the human eye tends to blink less when using digital screens. Blinking helps remove contaminants from the eyes and keeps them moist and a reduced blink rate can result in dry eyes. The eyes also tend to work more as the brain tries to reconcile the differences between virtual and perceived depths. VR headsets also induce visually induced motion sickness in some people. This “cybersickness” can persist long after the user has stopped wearing the headset, the symptoms of which include headaches, lightheadedness, difficulty focusing, sweating, and nausea. People who are prone to motion sickness or already have problems that affect their depth perception are especially susceptible to cybersickness. How to Take Care of Your Eyes if You Use VR Headsets Fortunately, there are things that you can do to help reduce the effects of wearing VR headsets. The following can also be helpful if your daily routine involves prolonged use of digital screens: Follow the “20 20 20 Rule”. Take breaks from using your VR headset and follow the 20 20 20 rule: for every 20 minutes you spend looking at a screen, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Moisturize your eyes. In addition to taking regular breaks, apply eye drops to keep your eyes moist. Limit your usage. Don’t use the VR headset longer than you have to, particularly during late hours. In addition to eye strain, the constant exposure to blue light emitted by the screen can affect your body’s melatonin production and affect your sleep cycles. Lastly, visit your eye doctor regularly to prevent further eye problems.

In fact, they’re a component of your immune system that prevents infection, with tears containing water and salt to moisten your eyes as you blink. Sometimes, the glands under your eyelids may produce too many tears. When it discharges through your tear ducts, they become overwhelmed, resulting in watery eyes. This usually gets resolved without treatment, but if this is a recurring problem, refrain from wearing any contact lenses and have your eyes checked at a trusted eye center. Common Causes Normally, you produce excess tears when you feel certain emotions, as well as when you laugh, vomit, cough, yawn, or experience strong taste sensations. However, in some cases, the cause for watery eyes can also be dry eye syndrome. With extremely dry eyes, you’re not able to receive proper lubrication and you’ll keep producing excess tears. This happens if your tears don’t contain the right balance of water, salt, and oils. Your eyes become irritated which causes the overproduction of tears to spill through your tear ducts. Knowing When to See a Doctor Normally, your watery eyes will clear up without any treatment. But if it keeps happening, you’ll have to see your trusted eye exam doctor for a check up. They’ll be able to determine the cause of your dry eyes so they can administer the best treatment. Sometimes, the causes can be as simple as an injured or scratched eye. It can also be as obvious as swollen or red eyes. But other symptoms can also be tenderness around your nose or sinuses, as well as a severe headache associated with your watery eyes.

Blog eye care What Are Myopia Treatment Benefits?What Are Myopia Treatment Benefits? March 14, 2023 by Vic Doce In this blog, discover the benefits of treating myopia early. Myopia is one of the most common vision issues among children, with 1 in 3 being myopic. It’s an epidemic that is projected to affect half of the world’s population by the year 2050. At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to give children better vision for life so they can accomplish their goals and avoid other serious vision problems in the future. Short Term Benefits of Myopia Treatment Some of the short term benefits of myopia treatment include increased confidence in your child, better vision to engage more actively in school and other activities, and an overall better quality of life. 1\\\\. Improved vision: Treehouse Eyes offers a holistic approach to myopia management. Specializing in treatment options for myopia, Treehouse Eyes doctors take into account a child’s background, genetics, and lifestyle. After evaluation, your child will receive proper treatment for myopia such as contact lenses or prescription eye drops. 2\\\\. Better academic performance: Children with myopia may often experience difficulty reading the board or seeing the screen in a classroom setting. It can also cause a lack of confidence to speak up in class because of their vision impairment. Treating myopia can help your child see clearly and give them the confidence to engage academically. 3\\\\. Reduce Eye Strain: Children with myopia may experience headaches and other symptoms from trying to focus on distant objects. Myopia treatment can help alleviate these symptoms for your child. 4\\\\. Increased quality of life: Treating myopia early on can help improve your child’s confidence by allowing them to participate in a wider range of activities. This can also help them excel at hobbies they currently struggle with due to their vision. Some studies show the relationship between myopia and mental health issues. Myopia management can lead to improved mental health and overall happiness for your child. Long term Benefits of Myopia Treatment There are numerous long term benefits to treating myopia early on, which is where the Treehouse Eyes mission, “giving children better vision for life,” comes into play. 1\\\\. Reduce the risk of serious eye diseases: High myopia can lead to other serious eye diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachments, macular degeneration, and cataracts. Early intervention to treat myopia is key so your Treehouse Eyes doctor can greatly reduce those risks for your child. 2\\\\. More Career Prospects: Some careers may require good vision such as the military, aviation industry, surgeons and paramedics, or any rescue team such as a firefighter or a lifeguard. By slowing down the progression of myopia, your child will have a larger range of opportunities and won’t be held back by their myopia. 3\\\\. Lower healthcare costs: Treating myopia early might save your child higher vision care costs. Treatment of other eye diseases can be expensive, so the earlier myopia is treated, the less likely it could lead to an eye disease that is more serious. 4\\\\. Overall Improved Quality of Life: People with myopia may experience day to day difficulties with things such as difficulties driving, playing sports, or reading. Early intervention for myopia is key and can improve overall vision making daily activities easier and more enjoyable.

Blog eye care What Are Toric Lenses For?What Are Toric Lenses For? October 12, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Astigmatism is a fairly common eye condition: about one in three people suffer from this condition. The cornea (the clear outer surface of the eyes) of patients with astigmatism is shaped more like a football instead of a perfectly round ball (which is the ideal shape for your eyes). This irregular curve bends light more in one direction and causes blurry vision. Fortunately, moderate astigmatism can be easily corrected using toric contact lenses. How are toric lenses different from normal contact lenses? Lumen Optometric, your trusted scleral optometrist, elaborates on the key features of toric lenses below: How the Shape of Toric Lenses Is Different Normal contacts have are spherical shaped whereas toric lenses are shaped like the side of a donut. Thanks to this unique shape, toric lenses have different refractive powers that can correct astigmatism. They also have a small weight in their edges make sure your contacts return to their proper alignment after you blink. (Whenever you blink, the contacts on your eye rotate.) Why It’s Important That Your Toric Contacts Fit Well It’s important that your contacts fit properly, but it’s especially so for toric lenses. That’s because ill fitting toric lenses that slip easily won’t be able to improve the clarity of your vision. What Are the Different Types of Toric Lenses? Toric lenses are either made of soft or hard (also known as rigid gas permeable) lenses. Soft lenses are comfortable to wear, but hard lenses which are more likely to stay in place tend to perform better than soft lenses. However, it usually takes a longer time to adjust to hard lenses. If you want to learn more about toric lenses as well as other treatment options, like neurolens treatment, for other vision conditions, consult your eye doctor. Looking for eye specialists near you?

If you have plans with your soon to be spouse, know that you don’t have to ditch your spectacles, especially if they are what makes you distinct in terms of personality. Here are some pieces of advice from Lumen Optometric to help you get the most out of the look on your wedding day. Make Your Glasses a Statement Piece You won’t be hard pressed to find a stylish set of frames nowadays. In addition to vision correction, they can help enhance your appearance, especially when you wear your wedding outfit. If you are getting a new pair before your big day, be sure that you treat it like jewelry. In other words, it should complement your dress or suit. Schedule a Custom Fitting Don’t go for the first frames you see right from the shelf. Schedule a custom fitting with your future spouse so you can find the perfect pair of eyeglasses that will match the style you’re looking for. Your eye exam doctor can help you choose which frames suit you best, taking note of the shape and other details of your face as a guide. You’ll want them to be of the perfect size and fit, so you can wear them from the wedding ceremony at church to the reception venue. Minimize the Glare It’s one thing to get the perfect frame size and style, but it’s also another thing to get the best prescription possible for vision correction. Your current prescription may no longer work for you, and your next visit to your eye doctor is essential for determining whether you need a new one. While you’re at it, why not ask about anti reflective options? Expect many photo ops at the wedding march and the reception, so lenses with this feature are a must have for your new specs. At Lumen Optometric, we want to make sure that you will get the best pair of eyewear possible that fits this important occasion. Apart from this, you can count on us to provide other exceptional eye care services, including neurolens therapy and corneal reshaping.

Blog eye care What Can Make Contact Lens Fitting Harder?What Can Make Contact Lens Fitting Harder? September 30, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Ill fitting contacts can cause a host of problems, including sensitivity to light, dry eyes, and contact lens intolerance (a condition that causes pain whenever contacts are worn). That’s why it’s important that your contacts fit your eyes properly. The problem is that some diseases and conditions can make contact lens fitting harder. Lumen Optometric, your trusted scleral optometrist, gives an overview below: Dry eye – The surface of your eye needs to stay moist. Without sufficient lubrication and moisture, the surface of your eye becomes more vulnerable to inflammation. Wearing contacts can also exacerbate issues related to dry eyes. That’s because the lack of lubrication increases the friction between the eyes and contacts, increasing discomfort for lens wearers. Using artificial tears can help alleviate symptoms of dry eye. However, certain formulations work better than others. That’s why if you need dry eye treatment, it’s best to consult your local eye doctor. Keratoconus – This is a progressive disease that causes corneas (the outer layer at the front of your eye that’s responsible for focusing light) to become thinner and bulge outward into a cone shape. The cornea’s irregular shape distorts a patient’s vision and makes fitting contacts harder. Does This Mean Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes Still Wear Contacts? Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes need to wear custom molded scleral lenses, which are larger than gas permeable contact lenses. Thanks to their large size, they can cover the entire corneal surface. Since scleral lenses rest on the less sensitive part of the sclera or the white outer layer of the eye, patients with Keratoconus don’t usually experience discomfort when using them. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including scleral lens fitting and neurolens treatment services. Our proprietor Dr. Eric To is the only practice owning optometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society.

Blog eye care What Causes Myopia?What Causes Myopia? May 10, 2021 by Lumen Optometric The drastic increase in the number of children diagnosed with myopia during the past decade is astonishing but is it surprising? Not really. When you analyze the causes of myopia, it becomes clear why more and more children are becoming affected by this progressive eye disease. What Is Myopia? Myopia, often referred to as nearsightedness, is an eye disease in which the eye elongates more than it should, causing light to be focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina’s surface. Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors lead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status. Genetics A child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or your spouse are myopic. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all over the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day, whether reading a book, using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or another device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially in excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and progression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration of near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating novel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a magazine a few minutes at a time. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Other Risk Factors Associated with Myopia Height taller children and adolescents have a higher incidence of myopia than their shorter counterpartsEducation level There is a higher incidence of myopia in people with advanced degrees, as well as higher parental education levels.Ethnicity Individuals from Asian Pacific Islander communities are more at risk of developing myopia. If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease.

So, how can you make your home safer for your eyes? A few simple practices can significantly reduce the risk of accidental eye injuries. Continue reading to learn why practicing eye safety at home is important and how to maintain good eye health. The Importance of Eye Safety at Home Eye safety at home is essential for several reasons. For one, it helps prevent accidents and injuries that can lead to vision problems. Many preventable eye injuries occur right in the comfort of our homes. From minor irritations to major injuries, our eyes face potential hazards from everyday household items. Therefore, having an eye safety routine can go a long way in preventing eye health issues. Furthermore, eye safety at home is indispensable for preserving your vision and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By being proactive and taking necessary precautions, you can reduce the risk of eye injuries and conditions that may have a lasting impact on your visual health. Maintaining Your Eye Health at Home Paying attention to your eye health is essential for preserving your vision and preventing eye related problems. Here are some tips to maintain healthy eyes. Regular Eye Examinations One way to keep your eyes healthy is to have regular eye exams with your doctor. These exams help catch potential vision issues early and allow your doctor to prescribe corrective glasses or contact lenses or recommend other necessary treatments. Protective Eyewear Whether you’re doing crafts, cleaning your home, or mowing the garden, wear protective eyewear. Goggles, for instance, form a physical barrier between your eyes and potential hazards, minimizing the risk of eye injury. Safe Use of Cosmetics and Cleaning Products If improperly used or stored, cosmetics and cleaning products pose a significant eye hazard. Therefore, consider eye safety while using and storing these substances and close your products securely. Adopting Healthy Habits Adequate nutrition, regular breaks from screen time, and ensuring sufficient lighting while reading and working are simple yet effective practices to keep your eyes healthy. Monitoring Vision Changes Take note of any changes in your vision. Contact your eye care professional immediately if you feel discomfort or notice changes. If you want to schedule an analysis of your eye health, contact Lumen Optometric at or fill out our online form to schedule a consultation.

June 14, 2022 by Lumen Optometric An annual eye exam is one of the best ways to keep your eyes healthy. Since you’ll only be seeing your eye doctor once a year, you need to make the most of it. That includes asking the important questions pertaining to the current state of your eyesight. Lumen Optometric lists some of them below. “Are My Eyes Healthy?” If your doctor detects a disease during the eye exam such as age related macular degeneration or glaucoma, they will educate you thoroughly and advise you how to safeguard your eyes. However, even if you haven’t been diagnosed with such, it’s best to prioritize your wellness, especially when it comes to your vision. Be sure to ask your doctor if there are ways to improve your vision and ocular health. They will be able to present you with options to retain your healthy eyesight. “Are There Any Changes I Should Do to Protect My Eyes?” Several eye diseases have been linked to UV exposure, from cataracts to eye cancers. Sunglasses can prevent these issues, but your eye doctor may recommend UV blocking contact lenses to block the peripheral light that sunglasses cannot block. If you are already wearing a contact lens, you can replace your lenses as prescribed by your doctor. “Are Digital Devices Affecting My Eyesight?” More than 83% of Americans use digital devices for more than two hours each day, which can lead to digital eye strain. Common symptoms include eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes. During the eye exam, your eye doctor can suggest several tips to alleviate digital eye strain. These may include offering dry eye treatment, changing the lighting and display settings, or wearing specialized prescriptions, including contact lenses. “When Should I Return for My Next Visit?” Depending on your age, vision, and medical history, your eye doctor will determine how often you need an exam. Staying on schedule is crucial, especially if you have underlying eye conditions that need to be treated. Most eye care centers may schedule your next appointment right away. Otherwise, be sure to set a reminder on your phone. Here at Lumen Optometric, our eye care professionals are happy to assist you with your eye health concerns.

Children frequently experience myopia progression, which lowers their quality of life and increases risks to their eye health. Myopia control treatments are now able to improve children’s vision and promote long term eye health. Read on to find out more! What is Myopia? People with myopia have blurred vision when looking at objects from a distance. When myopia worsens, the blur can become noticeable even when the object is close to or at arm’s length. Near sightedness or short sightedness are other names for it. Myopia usually begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 14 and generally becomes progressively worse every several months in children. It results from the eyes’ rapid and excessive expansion relative to the usual pace of eye growth. The eyes should continue to expand consistently in size until adolescence, then stabilize. However, with myopia, the eyes develop too quickly, causing rapid and continuous vision loss as well as ongoing eye growth into adolescence and even early adulthood. Myopia progression is the term used to describe this continuing deterioration. What is Myopia Control? The use of treatments intended to stop the advancement of myopia is known as “myopia control.” These treatments include atropine eye drops, soft contact lenses, ortho k, and special types of glasses. Myopia control is especially crucial for children, as it is in this age group that myopia is most likely to progress or worsen quickly. Both myopia management and myopia control are phrases used to refer to the additional clinical care needed for myopic children and adults. Myopia control typically entails using eye drops, contacts, or glasses to stop the progression of myopia. Myopia control is a broad term that encompasses maintaining eye health as well as various lifestyle and environmental factors that may contribute to the advancement of myopia. What are The Advantages of Myopia Control? The primary advantage of treating myopia is to reduce the risks associated with high myopia. Those with high degrees of myopia will have increased risk for diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachments, and myopic maculopathy. Myopia requires the use of spectacles or contact lenses to treat blurry distance vision. If your myopia is lower, you will be more functional in the mornings before putting on your contacts or glasses. You’ll be able to work a little better without them as opposed to becoming totally incapacitated without them. Additionally, a lower prescription increases the likelihood that your child will be a good candidate for laser eye surgery as an adult to correct their myopia, as well as the likelihood that they will have better visual results after surgery. What Else Should I know? Numerous studies have demonstrated that a child’s or teen’s visual environment can raise their chances of developing and progressing myopia. When creating the visual environment, do increase the duration of outdoor time your child has. Talk to your eye doctor or optometrist about the ideal duration they should spend outdoors and on screens and or reading to control your child’s myopia. These can play a significant role in ensuring the optimum results from myopia control treatments.

This is especially bad when the person has ocular misalignment, allowing for a condition termed trigeminal dysphoria. The premier corneal reshaping specialist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares more details about trigeminal dysphoria and how you can alleviate its symptoms. Who is At Risk of Trigeminal Dysphoria? People who experience trigeminal dysphoria–about 90% of them, in fact, according to studies–have ocular misalignment when viewing nearby objects instead of at a distance. This means their regular and continued use of digital devices becomes even more problematic since the task involves full on near vision. To compensate for this problem, their vision must work overtime. This, in turn, puts a strain on the trigeminal nerve–the largest and most complex nerve connected to the brain. When the trigeminal nerve is triggered, these allow for symptoms that include headaches, eye strain, light sensitivity, and neck and shoulder pain. How Do You Confirm You Have Trigeminal Dysphoria? The symptoms mentioned above are also associated with a number of eye conditions. To determine whether you actually have trigeminal dysphoria, you should visit a trusted local eye exam doctor like Lumen Optometric. Our trained and skilled eye care specialists will perform a comprehensive checkup of your eyes and accurately determine the root of its problem. If the results are indeed trigeminal dysphoria, we can offer a safe and effective way to alleviate its symptoms. What is Neurolens Treatment Technology? Lumen Optometric is the only neurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley. With the use of advanced and customized lenses, we can correct your specific ocular misalignment so you won’t have to struggle to see up close or far away. This means a reduced potential for symptoms involved with trigeminal dysphoria, allowing only for the most comfortable vision possible. Neurolens utilizes different technology to conventional contact lenses. To ensure you get the specialized lenses that can perfectly fit your eyes and help with your specific symptoms, Lumen Optometric will measure your eye misalignment using sophisticated equipment, SightSync. You’ll start noticing vision improvements with neuronlens within the week–those with extremely chronic conditions, however, may require at least six weeks before they can see the difference.

October 12, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Have you ever asked, “Why are my eyes so dry?” Turns out, this is not an uncommon issue, and many face it, especially in this digital age. There could be multiple reasons, from environmental factors to something more serious. Read on to learn more about dry eyes, including the main causes and treatment options. Main Causes of Dry Eyes Several factors can contribute to dry eyes: Aging. With age, our tear production naturally decreases. This is why people over 50 are more likely to experience dry eye symptoms. Gender. Hormonal changes, particularly during pregnancy, using oral contraceptives or menopause, can cause dry eyes in women. Environmental Conditions. Dry, windy, smoky or dusty conditions can increase tear evaporation. Also, spending long hours looking at the computer screen can reduce the blink rate, drying your eyes out. Medications. Certain drugs, including antihistamines, decongestants, blood pressure medications and antidepressants, can reduce tear production. Health Conditions. Certain health issues can cause dry eyes, such as Sjogren’s syndrome, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid problems. How to Treat Dry Eyes Treatment for dry eyes typically aims at restoring or maintaining the normal amount of tears in the eye to minimize dryness and related discomfort. Here are some of the most common: Artificial Tears. Over the counter eye drops that mimic your natural tears may relieve mild cases of dry eyes. Lifestyle Changes. Taking breaks during long tasks, avoiding air blowing in your eyes and adding moisture to the air at home or work can help. Prescription Medications. Certain prescription drugs can help increase tear production. Special Procedures. In severe cases, various procedures can be used, like closing your tear ducts to reduce tear loss or using special contact lenses. If you’ve tried home care methods and over the counter solutions without success, it’s time to see a doctor. Seek immediate medical attention if you have: Unbearable eye discomfort A significant decrease in vision Other symptoms like redness, swelling or discharge Dry Eye Treatment at Lumen Optometric At Lumen Optometric, we understand that every individual is unique.

August 3, 2021 by Lumen Optometric People who get new eyeglasses can sometimes experience discomfort. Some get nose pain and marks, while others feel eye strain or ear pain. To avoid these issues when getting new glasses or contact lenses, it is important to work with a reliable eye care professional. Here are possible reasons your new eyeglasses might be uncomfortable to wear. Your Eyeglasses Are Loose If your eyeglasses feel like they are falling every time you move, it could be that they are too loose around your ears. You can try to run your glasses under warm water and slightly bend the temple arms down. Another solution is to get eyeglasses in smaller frames that best fit your face shape. You Have a Low Nose Bridge You may have a low nose bridge if your eyeglasses slip down when you tilt your head. If this is the case, you may need the help of your eye exam doctor to find glasses that are suitable for lower nose bridges. They may suggest getting rectangular or horn rimmed glasses. Moreover, you can also try adjusting the nose pads of your glasses inward, so they sit more securely to your nose. Your Glasses Are Not Set Correctly When glasses leave marks on your nose bridge, it could be that they are not set correctly. It is easy to adjust the nose pads of your glasses, so they sit on your nose properly. Your optician may also adjust them or change them with another material, such as silicone, acetate, or nylon. If you have a plastic frame, it’s possible that they are too heavy or the bridge may not be big enough. You may want to consider investing in eyeglass frames with a wider bridge or lighter weight lenses. Incorrect Pupillary Distance Measurement You may still get headaches from properly sized eyeglasses if it has an incorrect pupillary distance (PD) measurement. PD refers to the distance between your pupils and is necessary for eyeglass wear comfort. Mistakes on PD are common for people who get their prescription glasses. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care needs. Besides glasses and contacts, we also offer neuro lens and corneal reshaping therapy.

Blog eye care Why Do Aging Eyes Need More Light?Why Do Aging Eyes Need More Light? September 6, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Your eyes and vision will reach complete development by the time you’re in your early 20s. Usually, you won’t notice significant changes in your vision until your 40s. It isn’t uncommon for older adults to experience difficulty in reading small print or need more light to see clearly. Learn why it happens from a local orthokeratology specialist. Aging Eyes: Why Do They Need More Light? In your 40s, the lenses of your eyes can start to turn yellow and get more rigid. It can reduce the amount of light that enters your eyes and affect color accuracy and focus. As you age, your corneas can thicken and become more opaque. Your pupils can also begin to shrink. These changes can further decrease and diffuse the light that reaches your eyes. Individuals who are 65 and older might need more light to see clearly. Their eyes might take longer to adjust from light to dark environments and vice versa. It can be more challenging for older adults to focus on nearby objects. They can also experience sensitivity to glare. Tips to Help You Adjust to Vision Changes See Your Eye Doctor Regularly Regardless of age, you must see an eye exam doctor regularly. Doing so helps in detecting and treating vision threatening conditions in their early stages. Macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the most common eye problems in older adults. They don’t usually show early signs, and you might not know you have them until they have progressed. Make Necessary Changes to Your Home People who are 65 and older often need twice as much light as young adults to see well. You can make your living space safer by increasing ambient light. Consider adding dimmer switches so each family member can easily adjust the room’s illumination depending on their needs. Place task lighting wherever they are necessary. It’s also essential that light switches are easy to access. Don’t wait for your vision to change before seeing an eye doctor. For personalized eye care services, turn to Lumen Optometric.

As another year unfolds, people usually start listing habits they want to begin and ones they wish to quit. In your New Year’s resolutions, it would be great if you could include things that can help with your vision and eye health. For instance, seeing an eye exam doctor regularly. Here’s what you can include in your vision and eye health resolutions for 2022. Reducing Screen Time Today, people spend more time on screens than ever before. However, excessive screen time can be detrimental to your eyes. It can increase your risk of developing dry eye syndrome, a condition that can cause your eyes to become red, dry, and itchy. If you have a job that requires you to use the computer for hours, make sure to give your eyes a break every once in a while. Practice Healthy Contact Lens Wear Contact lenses are a great option for people who don’t prefer to wear glasses. Using contacts is safe as long you practice good hygiene, wear them properly, and follow your eye doctor’s recommendations. You should avoid wearing contacts for extended periods, reusing old solution, and handling lenses without washing your hands. Avoid Constant Eye Rubbing While it may be tempting to rub your eyes when they are itchy, you shouldn’t. Doing so will only worsen the problem and put too much pressure on your eyes or even scratch them. You can use a cold compress if your eyes keep itching. If it feels like there’s something inside your eye, gently flush it with water. However, if the sensation persists, it’s best to see your eye doctor. Wear Proper Eye Protection The sun’s ultraviolet rays can be extremely harmful to your eyes. When going outside, make sure to wear UV blocking sunglasses. Moreover, use protective eyewear when swimming, cooking with oil, doing home improvements, and other activities that risk eye injuries or involve chemicals.

June 17, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Cataracts are commonly associated with the elderly; however, children and young adults can also develop them. It might sound surprising, but various circumstances and conditions can result in cataracts at any age. Let’s explore how cataracts aren’t strictly an age related condition. Dispelling the Misconception About Age and Cataracts While cataracts are most common among the elderly, it is a fallacy to say they are exclusively an age related condition. For various reasons, children and young adults can also develop cataracts, even if they’re wearing contact lenses. For instance, newborns can be afflicted with cataracts, a condition known as congenital cataracts. This congenital eye problem can be hereditary or caused by infections during pregnancy. Likewise, young adults can acquire what are known as secondary cataracts due to certain diseases like diabetes or lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Symptoms and Detection of Cataracts in Young People Symptoms of cataracts can be quite similar across all age groups, including blurred or cloudy vision and difficulty with night vision. Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial to detecting and managing this condition early. Your eye exam doctor is instrumental in this process, identifying signs that may be overlooked without professional evaluation. Management and Treatment of Pediatric and Young Adult Cataracts Treatment options for cataracts in young people depend on the severity of the condition and the individual’s age. In some cases, glasses or contact lenses may be sufficient to improve vision. For more advanced cataracts, surgery to remove the clouded lens and replace it with an artificial one may be necessary.

May 20, 2024 by Lumen Optometric It’s tempting to imagine that better eyesight can be achieved simply by adding a few vitamins to your daily routine. Although certain vitamins can influence eye health, these shouldn’t replace a well balanced diet. Before you rush off to buy these supplements, it’s important to note that these over the counter vitamins may not always bring the desired results and could sometimes even cause harm. Find out what the experts say regarding the effects of eye vitamins. What Are Over the Counter Eye Vitamins? Over the counter eye vitamins are non prescription supplements that may have the potential to enhance your eye health. You can find them in various forms, from tablets and capsules to liquid and powder. Can Eye Vitamins Improve Vision? Some studies suggest that specific vitamins may promote eye health and improve vision. However, these supplements don’t guarantee vision improvement for everyone. Their effect can differ based on individual health conditions and lifestyle. Vitamins That Can Influence Vision and Eye Health Several vitamins prove essential in maintaining healthy eyes. For instance, vitamins A, C and E are antioxidant vitamins that can help prevent age related macular degeneration, a leading cause of severe vision loss. On the other hand, B vitamins such as niacin and folic acid may reduce the risk of certain eye conditions. Balanced Diet vs. Supplement Intake Despite the potential benefits of these vitamins, remember that the safest and most effective way to acquire these nutrients is via a balanced diet. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats can provide the essential nutrients your body needs for overall health, including your eyes. Supplements should not replace a balanced diet but can serve as an excellent additional tool in case of deficiency or certain health conditions. Importance of Consultation Before Taking Supplements Think twice before grabbing eye vitamins off the shelf! Before beginning any dietary supplement regimen, let your eye doctor guide you on the best approach to supporting your eye health. Self prescription could lead to overconsumption, which can potentially cause health risks. If you need expert advice on any eye health concerns, contact Lumen Optometric.

Prolonged screen time can overwork your eyes and lead to eye strain, but the good news is that there are simple exercises that can help relax and refresh your eyes. Lumen Optometric, your go to provider of orthokeratology and other eye care solutions, shares five exercises that are specifically designed to minimize eye discomfort. Eye Strain Explained Also known as asthenopia, eye strain is a common condition characterized by discomfort in and around the eyes. These are often caused by activities requiring intense use of the eyes, such as reading, driving, or screen time, and the usual symptoms include dryness, redness, blurred vision, light sensitivity, and headaches. When you constantly fix your gaze on digital screens, your eyes have to incessantly focus and refocus, causing eye strain. Exercises To Prevent Eye Strain The following simple exercises can significantly reduce eye strain when incorporated into your daily routine: The 20 20 20 Rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break and look at something 20 feet away. This technique allows your eyes to rest from the intensity of the computer or smartphone screen. Blinking. This refreshes and moistens your eyes, which can prevent dryness and irritation. Palming. Rub your palms together to warm them, then place them gently over your closed eyes. Feel your eyes relax while you breathe deeply. Eye Rolling. Close your eyes and roll them gently in a circular motion. This helps to relieve tension around the eyes. Focusing Exercises. Hold your thumb six inches away from your face and focus on it for five seconds. Then, focus on an object 20 feet away for another five seconds. Switch back and forth. This exercise helps train your eyes. The Importance of Professional Eye Care While these eye exercises can help prevent eye strain, it’s equally important to have regular, comprehensive eye checks done by an eye exam doctor. These exams will help in the early identification of any potential eye related issues. Let Lumen Optometric Take Care of Your Vision Eye strain is a widespread issue, but the good news is that it can be managed effectively through regular exercises and professional eye care.

Unfortunately, it also brings factors that can affect your eye health and vision. Understanding these factors can help you protect your eyesight and enjoy all winter offers without worry or discomfort. Complications of Cold Weather on Eye Health During colder temperatures, your eyes may suffer several complications that warrant an eye exam. Dry Eyes: The cold weather often reduces the amount of moisture in the air, resulting in dry eyes for many people. Due to reduced humidity levels inside homes or offices and increased wind speeds, it can be difficult for tears to form normally. This can lead to irritation, redness, itching and burning sensations around the eyes that may cause further complications if left untreated. Wind and Dust: During colder temperatures, wind gusts are much stronger than usual, which increases dust particles being blown into our eyes. This can cause irritation and potential damage to sensitive structures within our ocular areas, such as the conjunctiva (the white part) or cornea (the clear front layer). Sun Glare: With sun glare reflecting off ice crystals in the sky combined with strong winds blowing snowflakes across areas where there should be little obstruction from sunlight, there is an increased risk for UV exposure. This can cause temporary issues such as headaches and long term damage, including age related macular degeneration (AMD), over prolonged periods if protection isn’t taken seriously. Prevention Tips for Eye Health in Winter Here’s what you can do to protect your eyes from the cold: Wear Protective Eyewear: Wearing protective eyewear will help reduce exposure levels significantly while allowing us to see better under harsh conditions. Protective eyewear contains polarized lenses providing clearer images even when light reflects off surfaces like bodies of water or icy grounds. We recommend investing in quality frames lenses designed against UV radiation to keep your vision intact. Hydrate: We suggest drinking plenty of fluids throughout days spent outdoors this season, not only because staying hydrated helps fight dryness caused by winds but also because a lack thereof could lead to negative impacts. Take Breaks from Screens: Staring at screens for prolonged periods can cause eyestrain and fatigue, leading to redness, itchiness, dry eyes and other complications. Taking regular breaks from any digital device, especially when wearing contact lenses, helps give your eyes a break so they can rest and recuperate more effectively. Eat Nutritious Foods: Eating nutritious foods rich in vitamins and minerals, such as dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes and oily fish, is important because these substances can help strengthen eye structures against external factors like dryness and wind. They provide nutrients that benefit long term vision health, reducing risks associated with certain conditions, including AMD (age related macular degeneration) and cataracts. Visit an eye exam doctor: If you are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned above or if you have any questions about how to protect your eyes during winter, consult an eye doctor.

Nevertheless, many people are unaware that October is also Halloween Eye Health and Safety Month, a wonderful time to highlight the need to protect your vision during this festive season. At Treehouse Eyes, we believe in preserving your child’s eyesight all year round, ensuring better vision for life. In this blog post, we’ll explore some simple yet effective ways to protect your eyes and ensure a safe and enjoyable Halloween celebration. Choose the Right Costume Accessories: One of the most fun elements of Halloween is dressing up in unique costumes. Yet, certain costume accessories might be hazardous to your eyes. While choosing masks, headgear, and other accessories, use caution. Check that they fit comfortably and do not block your view. Be sure to try and use outfits with transparent, non toxic face paint or cosmetics. Beware of Decorative Contact Lenses: Colored or decorative contact lenses are a popular choice for enhancing Halloween costumes, but they can be dangerous if not worn properly. Only a qualified eye care provider with a valid prescription should be able to get these lenses. To avoid eye infections, never exchange contact lenses with others and adhere to the prescribed cleaning and wearing schedule. Mind the Makeup: Makeup is an important aspect of many Halloween outfits, but be cautious when applying it around your eyes. Use hypoallergenic makeup and avoid applying makeup inside the lash line or straight onto the eyeball for cosmetics safety. To avoid eye discomfort and infection, always remove your makeup before going to bed. Talk to your Eye Doctor: Do you have any questions about what not to wear on Halloween? Are you looking for fun contacts to tske your costume over the top? Trust your eye doctor to answer any questions you have.

January 11, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Regular eye exams are an important part of a child’s healthcare. Pediatric eye exams can detect vision problems early and help children develop the skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. A scleral optometrist discusses the ideal schedule for pediatric eye exams here. What Is a Pediatric Eye Exam? A pediatric eye exam is a comprehensive assessment of your child’s eyesight. During the appointment, an optometrist will evaluate how well your child can see from near and far distances, their peripheral vision and depth perception, and any underlying conditions or diseases that could affect their vision. How Often Should Pediatric Eye Exams Be Scheduled? The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that all children receive comprehensive pediatric eye examinations at least once between the ages of 3 to 5 years old, followed by yearly checkups until age 18 (or 21 if still in school). However, certain risk factors may increase the frequency with which these appointments should occur. Issues such as premature birth or family history of ocular diseases, like glaucoma, cataracts, retinopathy, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, strabismus (crossed eyes) and uncorrected refractive error, may make your child prone to certain eye health problems. Even dry eye, a natural part of aging, affect children and require them to undergo dry eye treatment. In these cases, it’s best to consult your optometrist, who will create an individualized plan based on your needs and risk factors in your family history and medical records. What To Expect During An Eye Exam When you bring your little one for an eye exam, the doctor will conduct various tests to assess their eyes’ health and function. These tests may include: Visual acuity test – This measures how your child can see at different distances. Refraction test – An examination to determine whether corrective lenses are needed for optimal vision. Color blindness test – A simple screening tool that checks for color deficiencies. Slit lamp exam – Used to check for any signs of infection or damage on the eye’s surface. Retinoscopy autorefractor – A method doctors use to measure refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. If you’re looking for a comprehensive pediatric eye exam in Sierra Madre, CA, look no further than Lumen Optometric. Our team of experienced optometrists will work with you to ensure that your child’s vision is healthy and they’re seeing their best.

Perhaps they have been struggling to see things clearly from a distance. If so, they might be experiencing a common vision problem known as myopia or nearsightedness. Alarmingly, studies show that childhood myopia rates are on the rise globally. Read on as Lumen Optometric shares crucial insights into this escalating issue, its impact on children’s vision, and how early detection and treatment can make all the difference. Understanding Myopia Myopia, often known as nearsightedness, is a condition where objects up close are seen clearly, while objects farther away appear blurred. Usually developing in childhood, myopia occurs when the eye grows too long, preventing light from focusing directly on the retina. This irregularity causes distant objects to appear blurry, which could mean your child is struggling to see the school board or having difficulty playing sports. How an Eye Exam Doctor Can Help Detect Myopia An eye exam doctor plays a critical role in the early detection of myopia. During your child’s regular eye exams, they can accurately measure your child’s vision and eye health, diagnosing myopia and other potential vision problems. Remember, early intervention can prevent your child’s eyesight issues from worsening. Treatment Options for Childhood Myopia Once diagnosed, effective treatment options are available. One common approach is to prescribe contact lenses. These are usually worn during the day and removed at night, aiding in clear distant vision. Another advanced treatment option is orthokeratology, a non surgical procedure that gradually reshapes the eye’s curvature using specially designed contact lenses. One advantage of this process is that it slows down the progression of myopia in children, providing a more long term solution. How Lumen Optometric Can Help At Lumen Optometric, we’re dedicated to providing comprehensive eye care for your child. Based in Sierra Madre, CA, our team of eye doctors has the expertise to diagnose and treat myopia in children. Rest assured that we use the latest techniques, such as orthokeratology, to ensure optimal results and safeguard your child’s vision for the future.

Eye safety hazards during sports can range from minor scratches to severe trauma that can cause permanent vision loss. Choosing the right sports eye safety gear is crucial to protect your eyes from potential harm. In this article, we explore the different types of sports eye safety gear available and how to choose the right one for your needs. Identifying Your Needs When choosing the right sports eyewear, it is important to consider the type of sport you are playing and the level of intensity. For instance, you may need different protection for a non contact or low intensity sport like golf than for a full contact team sport like football. Choosing the appropriate eye protection will help protect your eyes while allowing you to play comfortably and safely. Features to Consider When selecting the right sports eye safety gear, these are the features you should consider. Fit Regardless of the type of activity you’re participating in, your eye doctor will recommend choosing eyewear that fits. Your eye gear should fit snugly and comfortably without slipping or moving during activity. Look for eyewear with adjustable straps or nose pads to ensure a proper fit. Comfort Your eyewear should also be comfortable to wear for extended periods. Look for soft padding or cushioning around the eyes. Lightweight materials that won’t bother you during activity are also excellent choices. Durability Sports eye safety gear should withstand impact and other potential hazards. Look for durable materials that can withstand rough handling. Polycarbonate lenses or frames made from strong plastics or metals work great for this purpose. Visibility Choose sports eye safety gear that doesn’t impede your vision. It should also provide you with a wide field of vision and have anti fog coatings, so you can see clearly during activity. Additionally, it may be worth investing in impact resistant lenses if you play contact sports. They absorb shock better than regular ones but still provide clear visibility even under extreme conditions. Lens Tint The tint of the lens is also an important consideration as it can affect your vision in different lighting conditions. Clear lenses suit low light conditions, while tinted or polarized lenses can reduce glare and improve visibility in bright sunlight. Shopping Tips Once you have identified your needs, research different brands and read customer reviews to compare features and quality. It is also worth asking for recommendations from friends or family who play the same sport. If you’re looking for eye exam doctors or orthokeratology or optometry specialists in Sierra Madre, CA, to help you pick the right eyewear for your preferred sport, Lumen Optometric can help.

Blog Eyes Is Myopia Hereditary?Is Myopia Hereditary? October 26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is an incredibly prevalent vision condition, affecting around 30% of Americans, with an estimated 20 25 million children untreated in the United States alone. It develops when the eyeball grows longer from front to back than normal, with the symptom of blurry distance vision. Myopia tends to begin in childhood and worsen over time. This leads many to wonder – is nearsightedness genetic? Let’s explore the evidence surrounding myopia’s hereditary patterns. Research Shows a Strong Genetic Link Extensive research, including twin studies, family patterns, and genetic mapping, provides compelling evidence that genetics play a significant role in myopia. While environmental factors can also influence myopia risk, the hereditary component cannot be ignored. Specific genetic variations affecting eye growth, development, and refraction have been identified that predispose people to nearsightedness. These genes often relate to connective tissues, neurotransmitters, and intracellular signaling. However, experts note there are likely numerous genes involved in determining myopia susceptibility and that environmental factors do play a role. Overall, studies show parents who are nearsighted have a greater chance of passing myopia on to their children. The odds also increase if both parents are nearsighted. The precise risk depends on the severity of parental myopia as well as environmental exposures. Ethnic patterns also demonstrate a genetic link. Asian countries, for example, have a much higher rate of myopia than European countries or the United States. While genetics play a key role, lifestyle and environmental factors fine tune how these predispositions manifest. But the bottom line is clear – nearsightedness has a powerful hereditary component overall. Myopia Progression in Children Since myopia most often develops and worsens during childhood, this is the period when genetic risk is most influential. Children with one or more myopic parents need close monitoring as their eyes continue to grow and develop refractive errors. Rapid myopia progression is especially common between ages 8 15. This is a critical time when interventions can help safeguard a child’s eyesight and offset inherited risks. Implementing myopia control techniques at younger ages appears to have the greatest impact on slowing progression long term. The complex interplay between hereditary susceptibility and environmental exposures determines if and when myopia manifests and progresses in children. However, identifying and addressing genetic predispositions early helps preserve vision potential. Warning Signs of Myopia Onset in Children For children with a family history of nearsightedness, be vigilant about the following signs that may indicate myopia onset: Squinting or eye rubbing Difficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading close work Headaches after visual tasks Sitting very close to the TV Tilting head or closing one eye Holding objects close to face Any appearance of nearsighted symptoms warrants a comprehensive eye exam to assess the child’s status. Long Term Impacts of High Myopia In addition to blurred distance vision, high degrees of nearsightedness increase vulnerability for several blinding eye diseases later in adulthood. These include: Retinal detachment and tears Open angle glaucoma Myopic maculopathy Advancing myopia also further elevates the risk of vision loss from these ocular conditions. Catching and controlling early myopia development can therefore help preserve long term eye health and function. By understanding the hereditary factors at play and monitoring children’s eyes proactively, the impacts of myopia on visual and ocular health can be reduced over a lifetime. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Compelling research confirms that nearsightedness (myopia) is influenced by genetic factors. And while they’re not the only factor, children with one or more myopic parents, especially at high degrees, need thorough eye exams starting at an early age to determine if they are developing refractive errors indicating myopia onset. Through early detection and consistent treatment, the progression of inherited myopia risks can be significantly slowed. While genetic predispositions cannot be changed, being proactive allows for preserving a child’s vision and safeguarding their eye health over time.

October 26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is one of the most common vision conditions affecting approximately 30+% of people in the United States. In fact, it is estimated that 20 25 million children have Myopia in the United States alone. With nearsightedness, objects up close are seen clearly while distant objects appear blurry or out of focus. This results when the eye grows too long from front to back measured by the axial length of the eye. The elongation of the eyeball causes light rays to focus incorrectly on the retina resulting in blurry distance vision. While nearsightedness cannot be cured, there are various options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia (nearsightedness). What Causes Nearsightedness? Nearsightedness occurs when the eyeball grows longer than normal from front to back. This causes the light entering the eye to focus in front of the retina rather than directly on it. This results in blurred distance vision, while near vision remains unaffected. Several factors contribute to the risk of developing nearsightedness, such as: Genetics – Research shows nearsightedness has a hereditary component. Children are more likely to be nearsighted if one or both parents have the condition vs. none. Frequent near work – Activities requiring prolonged close vision like reading and screen use may encourage eyesight to adapt towards nearsightedness over time. Excessive screen time – Increased use of computers, smartphones, tablets, and other screens is linked to rising myopia rates, especially in childhood. Reduced Outdoor time – Some studies indicate lack of outdoor exposure, natural sunlight, and vitamin D are associated with a greater incidence of nearsightedness. Urbanization – Populations living in urban versus rural areas tend to have higher rates of myopia on average. Ethnicity – Individuals of Asian descent have a higher prevalence of nearsightedness. Many Asian countries see nearsightedness (myopia) rates of over 80%. Signs and Symptoms The primary symptom of nearsightedness is blurred distance vision. When looking at distant objects like road signs, movies, whiteboards, or presentations, it can be difficult to see when nearsighted. This forces the eyes to strain and overwork to bring images into focus. As a result, individuals with uncorrected nearsightedness may experience: Difficulty seeing school classroom boards Squinting or leaning forward to see distant details such as the score of a game Headaches from excessive eye effort Eye fatigue after close work Poor night vision or problems driving at night Typically, both eyes are affected, though not always to the same degree. The blurry distance vision worsens gradually over time in most cases. Impacts of Uncorrected Nearsightedness Allowing nearsightedness (myopia) to remain untreated can lead to several problems for your child. Myopia usually progresses over time, resulting in greater blur and dependence on treatment or correction as you age. Constant squinting and eye effort add to fatigue and discomfort, and unclear vision makes reading and seeing whiteboards at school difficult. There is also evidence that myopia can have social implications, such as extracurricular activities that require distance vision become challenging. Not to mention many career options that have vision requirements. However, all these issues don’t compare to the increased risk of severe eye conditions like Glaucoma, cataracts, and the potential for retinal detachments. The severity of nearsightedness (myopia) typically stabilizes by adulthood. However, getting your child’s vision treated early provides significant benefits for eye health, visual development, and quality of life. Treatment Options for Nearsightedness While nearsightedness itself cannot be reversed or cured, there are effective treatment options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. The best option will depend on the severity of nearsightedness, lifestyle needs, age, and overall eye health of your child – all of which are taken into account when getting treatment with a Treehouse Eyes provider. Overnight Contact Lenses – Specially designed contact lenses are designed to be worn at night only, put in right before bed, and taken out in the morning. Called KIDS lenses, these custom contact lenses gently and comfortably reshape the front surface of the eye during the night, with an effect that lasts all day. These lenses are customized for each child to fit their eye and are designed to help reduce the progression of myopia. Daytime Soft Contact Lenses – These customized contact lenses are designed to be placed on the eye in the morning and removed each night. They have a special optical design to reduce the progression of myopia while providing clear vision during the day. This treatment allows children to be free from glasses all day while providing excellent comfort and vision for all their activities. Prescription Eye Drops – Another treatment alternative is a prescription eye drop, formulated to a specific concentration known to reduce the progression of myopia. These drops are applied at night before bed, according to the schedule your Treehouse Eyes doctor recommends. The child wears glasses or contact lenses during the day. This treatment is excellent for families concerned if their child is ready for a contact lens treatment, and often used for younger children or those showing rapid progression. Keeping Nearsightedness (Myopia) Under Control Below are some helpful tips you can start using right now to help slow the progression of your child’s nearsightedness. Reduce near work and screen time for children and take frequent visual breaks Increase time outdoors and exposure to natural sunlight Ensure proper use and wear of prescribed vision correction Eat a diet rich in eye healthy nutrients like vitamins C and E Get yearly comprehensive eye exams to establish a baseline and monitor for changes The Importance of Eye Exams Nearsightedness develops gradually over time but can accelerate quickly if not monitored. Routine eye exams allow early detection and treatment. Annual comprehensive exams are recommended for: Children and teens showing signs of vision issues Individuals with a family history of high myopia Those with existing myopia require close monitoring Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child.

Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors lead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all over the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day, whether reading a book, or using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or another device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially in excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and progression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration of near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating novel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a magazine a few minutes at a time. Genetics A child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or your spouse are myopic. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! What Can You Do? The good news is there are many things you can do you help slow or stop the progression of myopia. Get Regular (annual or semi annual) Eye Exams Even if both parents aren’t myopic, it’s still recommended to get an annual eye exam for your child. You can schedule a myopia consultation with a Treehouse Eyes provider near you. Many pediatricians are able to complete basic eye exams – be sure to ask them to check for myopia! Encourage Breaks from Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day. Encouraging breaks from near work such as reading and electronic devices will help your child’s eyes and give them a chance to get back outside as it warms up. Spend More Time in Natural Sunlight As you encourage your child to take a break from near work, one of the best ways to enjoy that newfound time is to get outside! Natural sunlight, even in the classroom, can be protective of myopia. Be sure to wear some sunblock as well! If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood.

Both organizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life. What is Myopia? Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, resulting in blurry distance vision and increased risks of serious, sight threatening eye diseases, such as glaucoma1, cataract2, or retinal eye diseases3. An estimated 1 in 3 children in the U.S. have myopia and the prevalence has grown dramatically over the last 30 years4. Research has shown lack of outdoor time for kids and more near work, like reading and time on screens, drive the massive increase we are seeing in myopia5 7. Myopia Progresses As Your Child Grows Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. Natural Sunlight Can Help Myopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050. In fact, a recent study found that increased exposure to outdoor light reduces myopia development. There Are Now Treatments for Myopia There is hope for parents is there are several treatments now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good candidate for treatment.

Myopia is an eye disease that occurs when the eye grows too long like the shape of a football. This causes distant objects to appear blurry and increases the risk of serious, sight threatening eye diseases in adulthood. As a parent, you want what’s best for your child. By learning these 5 important facts, you may feel encouraged to do more for your child’s eye health and long term vision such as ensuring that they get their eyes checked on a regular basis and turning to myopia management to prevent the rapid progression of this disease. The COVID 19 Pandemic Has Increased Myopia Prevalence In Children The significant reduction in outdoor time during the pandemic combined with the surge in screen time has increased the incidence of myopia cases. According to a systematic review and meta analysis published in Ophthalmic Research (2020), outdoor time helps slow down the change of axial length and reduce the risk of myopia. Similar results were found in a previous study in Ophthalmology (2013) that investigated the association between myopia in children and adolescents, and the amount of time spent outdoors. The study analyzed over 10,000 children and adolescents aged 20 and under and concluded a substantial correlation between increased time spent outside and the prevalence of myopia. Each additional hour spent outside per week was linked to a 2% reduction in the risk of myopia. Myopia Increases the Risk of Eye Disease Those with high myopia and rapidly progressing myopia in childhood are more prone to developing ocular comorbidities or serious sight threatening eye diseases later in life, such as: GlaucomaMacular degenerationMyopic MaculopathyRetinal detachment Myopia is a Progressive Eye Disease Myopia usually starts in childhood and progresses throughout a child’s school years, eventually stabilizing around ages 18 22. Since the eye grows in sync with the rest of the body, it’s only natural that it ceases elongating in early adulthood when the rest of the body stops growing. This also means that a child’s growth spurts often coincide with a higher prescription. Fortunately, myopia can be efficiently treated in order to prevent it from worsening as the child grows. Slowing myopia early in life can make a significant difference in your child’s eye health in their present and future. Myopia Is An Epidemic Myopia is a global epidemic that continues to worsen, affecting close to 2 billion individuals worldwide. If current trends hold, roughly half of the world’s population will be myopic by the year 2050, partly due to genetics and increasingly as a result of our society’s preference for staying indoors and spending more time on digital screens. Myopia Can Be Treated Myopia cannot be cured; however, its progression can be slowed or even halted. The goal of myopia treatment, also known as myopia management or myopia control, is to reduce or halt the eye’s rapid growth. Effective myopia treatment entails more than simply correcting a child’s blurry vision with glasses; it’s meant to prevent a child’s vision from deteriorating and, thus lowering their risk of developing severe myopia related eye diseases later in life.

It alters the shape and structure of the eye limiting its capability to focus on objects in the distance (blurry distance vision). If you have struggled with the condition before, your kids might also develop the disorder at some point in life. Myopia starts with signs small signs such as squinting, sitting too close to the TV, tablet, or book, and sometimes even manifests as headaches. Besides pain and discomfort, the onset of myopia can have a ruinous impact on the quality of your kid’s life. It can be hard to read the board at school or perform well in extracurricular activities. Therefore, it is imperative to diagnose and prevent myopia from worsening to more sight threatening conditions. We have hand picked practical ways you can utilize in curbing the progression of myopia in children. Let Them Spend Time Outdoors The bright and ambient light outdoors is linked to the modulation of correct eye development. Spending time outdoors can help reprogram the eye structure to focus on distant objects. You should encourage your kid to spend more time outdoors especially if he or she has already been diagnosed with myopia. Quality outdoor time helps to preserve good eyesight in addition to delaying the onset or progression of nearsightedness. Ideally, children need a minimum of 90+ minutes of quality time outdoors every day. Regular Eye Checks are Crucial Myopia is a very treatable condition, particularly when detected early. That is why it is crucial to take your kid for an eye test at least once a year. The disorder might show very few signs in its early stages, which is why establishing baseline measurements early is paramount. Additionally, some of its signs like headache and blurry vision can easily be confused for other conditions. When left untreated, myopia will gradually progress increasing the likelihood of contracting other vision disorders like cataracts or detached retinas. The only reliable manner to know if your kid is at risk of nearsightedness is through a clinical eye test measuring the axial length of the eye. If your eye doctor is not conducting this test, they are not providing you with the best measure of your child’s eye health. Limit Screen Time Excessive screen time and continuous near work are the greatest non genetic risk factors for nearsightedness. Activities such as computer use, drawing, and reading can cause a substantial amount of strain on the eye. If your children cannot avoid these activities entirely, it is advisable to limit the time they spend on them. Taking regular breaks helps the eye to relax and is ideal for managing the nearsightedness condition. Try Soft multifocal Lenses for Myopia Control We are still a few months or even years away from an FDA approved eyeglass for treating myopia. By wearing our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses, your child no longer has to depend on glasses to have clear vision during the daytime. We understand that at times, glasses can be an inconvenience for activities like sports and other vigorous activities. As such, our contact lenses not only allow your child to see clearly but also be free from the hassle of wearing glasses. In addition, our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses, like all our other products, are FDA approved, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Our doctors would also follow up in subsequent consultations to ensure that your child is doing well and that our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses are comfortable for their eyes. Go for Atropine Eye Drops Atropine eye drops can help keep the progression of nearsightedness in check by curbing eyeball elongation. The chemical agent also strengthens eyeball structures to prevent unwarranted eye growth that might occur in adolescent years to trigger myopia. Atropine eye drops are safe when used in proper amounts. You should always follow the eye doctor’s prescription when administering the chemical for effective myopia modulation. Overnight Lenses Might Help Treehouse Eyes’ Overnight Contact Lenses are specially designed to be worn only in the evening as your child goes to bed. As such, our Overnight Contact Lenses should be worn during sleep and taken out in the morning before your child prepares for the day. Specifically called KIDS Lenses, these lenses are custom made for each child to gently and comfortably reshape the cornea, which is the clear front surface of the eye. It’s incredibly important to ensure that our Overnight Contact Lenses are tailored to each child as everyone’s eye shape is different. If the lenses do not fit a particular eye shape, the eyes may get infected by a corneal abrasion. As such, at Treehouse Eyes, each child will undergo a consultation to receive his or her very own lenses that are fitted to their unique eye shape. Studies have shown that myopia progression can be slowed dramatically and, in some cases, stopped through this treatment in children. Conclusion Although it is impossible to cure myopia, the condition can be treated with several clinical methods including the use of daytime soft lenses. A nearsightedness (or short sightedness) diagnosis does not mean it is over for your child. Instead, you should focus on managing the conditions with the right practices to contain its progression and slow or potentially stop the disease in its tracks.

Unfortunately, many people are unknowingly adopting habits that could be hurting their eyes. That’s why it’s a good idea to examine your everyday routine and daily habits to ensure you aren’t inadvertently doing something that could hurt your eyes. In this article, your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen Optometric highlights some common habits that are bad for your eyes. Bad Habit #1: Not giving your eyes a break. Smart phones, laptops, tablets,and other digital devices with LCD screens are a staple of almost everyone’s daily lives. While looking at digital screens cannot always be avoided, spare yourself from digital eye strain by resting your eyes after every 20 minutes of screen time. Bad Habit #2: Using contact lenses improperly. If you’ve undergone any type of lenses treatment such as neurolens therapy and need to wear special lenses, it’s critical that you follow your eye doctor’s instructions when it comes to handling and caring for your lenses. The same goes for standard contact lenses. Bad Habit #3: Rubbing your eyes. This habit might be a little harder to kick. It might feel gratifying to rub your eyes, but rubbing your eyes too vigorously can cause the blood vessels under your eyelids to break. Try a cold compress the next time your eyes feel irritated. Bad Habit #4: Not eating well. A well balanced diet is crucial to keeping your eyes healthy. Choose foods rich in vitamins C and E, as well as foods containing zinc and omega 3 fatty acids. You don’t have to cook elaborate meals just make sure you load up on citrus fruits, fish and leafy greens. Lumen Optometric cares about your eye health.

The degree of myopia varies and it happens to around 30% of children and teens. To remedy this, there are specific treatments called myopia control. But what exactly is myopia control? As your locally trusted scleral optometrist, we’re here to help you understand what you need to know about myopia control. What Is Myopia Control? “Myopia control” is the term to describe the methods used to prevent the progression of myopia. These measures are usually prescribed by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. They come in four primary treatments, namely: multifocal contact lenses, atropine eye drops, multifocal eyeglasses, and orthokeratology. These treatments are important because they can help reduce the risk of complications that lead to high myopia, such as cataracts, retinal detachment, glaucoma and even blindness. Multifocal Contact Lenses These lenses are designed to provide clear vision for people who have nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and other refractive errors. These are also designed for people who are experiencing the normal age related loss of near focusing ability called presbyopia. Atropine Eye Drops This is a kind of dry eye treatment that’s commonly used to reduce the pain associated with eye inflammation. It also gives relief from focusing fatigue by dilating the pupil to limit the eye’s ability to automatically change focus. Also called accommodation, the effect it has by atropine eye drops can be counted for its effectiveness in reducing myopia progression in children. Multifocal Eyeglasses The eyeglasses work similarly to multifocal contact lenses, which help wearers with presbyopia see clearly. This control treatment can also mildly slow the progression of myopia in children. But some studies show that the progression slowed up to 51 percent in children compared to wearing normal glasses for correction. Orthokeratology Orthokeratology, or Ortho K, are specially designed gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight while sleeping to help reshape the eye’s cornea. This slows down the progression of myopia as well as provides clearer vision during the daytime without the need for lenses or glasses. Some studies found that children wearing ortho k contact lenses reduced the lengthening of the eyeball by almost 43 percent compared to wearing regular eyeglasses for myopia correction.

Blog Information Can Myopia Be Prevented?Can Myopia Be Prevented? December 6, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Parents who are nearsighted often wonder what can be done to prevent their children from developing the same or similar conditions. While scientists haven’t yet found a way to guarantee that your child won’t develop myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), there are things you can do to delay its onset and even prevent its progression. What is Myopia? Myopia is a progressive eye disease that causes the eye to grow longer than normal, altering its ability to correctly focus light onto the retina. This results in blurred distance vision that can make it difficult for children to learn efficiently in the classroom or take part in extracurricular activities. Myopia is often corrected with prescription glasses or contact lenses, but these methods simply correct the child’s vision while allowing the condition to worsen. Why is it Important to Delay or Slow Myopia Progression? The worse your child’s myopia gets, the higher their chance of developing sight threatening diseases like glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment later in life. That’s why it’s important to try and keep your child’s lens prescription low and controlled using the methods listed below. If your child doesn’t yet have myopia, following the same protocol will help prevent myopia onset for as long as possible. Is it Possible To Prevent Myopia or Myopia Progression? While many children inherit myopia from their parents, there are also several environmental factors that can lead to the onset and progression of nearsightedness. By making some lifestyle changes, it may be possible to delay the onset of myopia and prevent its progression. Boost Daily Outdoor Time Research shows that children of myopic parents who spend a lot of time outdoors have lower rates of myopia than children who stay mostly indoors. A recent study published in Review of Optometry (2021) concluded that children should spend at least 2 3 hours per day engaged in outdoor activities to delay the onset of myopia, especially if a child has one myopic parent. Another study published in Ophthalmic Research (2020) confirms the protective effect of “sun time” against myopia onset. When observing the myopia rates of 6 12 year olds, there were fewer new myopia cases in the group of children who spent between 11 15 hours outdoors per week, compared with children who didn’t. The researchers also found that the myopia progression rate was slower in the group of children who spent more time in the daylight. If you do add some extra outdoor time to your child’s daily routine, be sure to provide them with UV blocking sunglasses, sunscreen, a water bottle and other sun safe gear. Limit Screen Time Screen time is thought to have a greater impact on a child’s vision than other near work like reading a book, for a few reasons. Children are exposed to digital screens at a younger age than other forms of near work, and they tend to use screens for longer intervals of time. Additionally, the working distance between a child’s eyes and a digital screen tends to be shorter than the distance between their eyes and a book or other object, to compensate for the small print size and images. An article published in Review of (2021) examines the results of several scientific studies that analyze the relationship between screen time and myopia. Two of these studies found that the risk of developing myopia was 8 times greater for children aged 5 15 who used a smartphone or video game for more than 2 hours a day, compared to children who have 0 2 hours of daily screen time. And while we don’t expect parents to ban all digital devices from their homes, it is advisable to set daily limits on digital device usage. Try to cap your child’s daily screen time at 2 hours. Children under the age of 2 should have as little screen time as possible. Encourage Frequent Breaks From Near Work Any sort of near work, like reading and writing, puts a strain on your child’s eyes and can contribute to myopia onset and progression. One way to prevent myopia development in your child is to teach them to take breaks from visually demanding activities. A 2008 study published in the journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science found that the intensity of near work plays an important role in myopia development in schoolchildren. According to the study, the duration of uninterrupted near work seems to be more significant than the overall time spent engaged in close distance activities. Regular Myopia Eye Exams Whether or not your young child or teen has myopia, yearly eye exams with your optometrist are crucial to keeping their vision healthy and clear. It’s important to note that vision screenings in school are not enough to detect most visual problems, and certainly not for preventing myopia. Tracking your child’s eyesight yearly will help determine the best treatment for preventing myopia onset and slowing or halting its progression.

While instances and awareness of myopia are on the rise, to help spread myopia awareness we’ve written out the basics on childhood myopia, why it matters, and what you as a parent can do to help preserve your child’s eye health in the long run. What is Myopia? Myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness) is the most common cause of impaired vision in people under age 40, and its prevalence in children is growing at an alarming rate. Myopia typically starts in childhood and progresses (the eye keeps getting bigger), or gets worse, until early adulthood. During this time the symptom of myopia, blurry distance vision, gets worse, meaning the patient needs stronger glasses to continue to see clearly. If blurry distance vision is the symptom of myopia, what exactly is myopia? Stated again, myopia is an eye that is growing too long. How do we know this? We measure it using special non invasive technology to calculate the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length and is measured down to fractions of a millimeter with advanced equipment. So, myopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye. Risk Factors for Myopia Myopia risk factors include genetics (having one or both parents myopic), an insufficient amount of time spent outdoors, and excessive near work (time spent reading, school work, & digital screens). Childhood myopia is progressive, which is why your child may need a new prescription every year or two. Unless treated, a child’s myopia will continue to worsen until early adulthood. What some people don’t realize is that myopia is far more than simply blurred vision it’s associated with drastically higher risk of developing eye disease in the future. How Can Myopia Impact a Child’s Health? Childhood myopia places a child at a greater risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life, as compared to non myopic children, and the odds only increase as myopia continues to progress. In fact, a child with myopia is 2 to 40 times more likely to develop myopic maculopathy (also known as myopic macular degeneration, a serious vision threatening complication) depending on their degree of nearsightedness. Retinal detachment is another serious eye condition that can cause permanent blindness. A myopic child is 3 to 21 times more likely to develop this emergency eye condition in adulthood. Moreover, children with myopia have a threefold risk of developing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, in the long run. And although cataracts are considered a normal part of aging, having myopia advances the age at which they develop. According to a study published in JAMA Ophthalmology, individuals with high myopia are more likely to need cataract surgery at an earlier age than those with no myopia. Furthermore, aside from an increased risk of adult eye disease, untreated myopia can prevent a child from succeeding academically and socially. A 2019 study published in the Community Eye Health Journal underscores the importance of excellent visual acuity in school aged children. It found that offering vision correction to students with myopia has more of an educational impact than providing them with vitamins or medications to maintain or improve their physical health. Myopia has equally serious ramifications outside the classroom. A study published in BMC Ophthalmology (2016) found that adolescents with myopia are more likely to have anxiety than their peers with normal vision. Furthermore, adverse visual symptoms impact a child’s self esteem, according to a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science. The good news is that certain lifestyle choices, especially when coupled with myopia management treatment, can have a lasting positive effect on your child’s eye health. What Can Parents Do To Help Slow Myopia Progression? We know that parents want what’s best for their children. So here are a few recommendations that will help keep your child’s eyes healthy whether or not myopia has set in. Take your kids outside to play. Several studies have indicated that children who spend over 2 hours outdoors during the day have lower levels of myopia and slower myopia progression. A recent study published in BMC Ophthalmology and cited in Review of Optometry (2021) found that for non myopic children with myopic parents, “a high level of outdoor exposure had a remarkable influence on the risk of new myopia for children even with one myopic parent.” Although it’s not always easy, try to limit the amount of continuous near work your child does. Whether it’s reading or scrolling through a phone, remind your child to take breaks. However, the most important thing you can do to protect your child’s long term eye health is manage their myopia with treatment. We Can Help Preserve Your Child’s Eye Health At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to provide expert care to each and every child with kindness and a smile.

Clear sight is vital for kids to thrive in school, sports, play, and daily life. However, many children have undiagnosed vision issues that require early detection and intervention for the best outcomes. Why Early Detection Matters Catching vision problems early in childhood is crucial. Early detection ensures children get the vision correction they need during critical developmental windows. Those children suffering from vision deficits can lead to academic issues, behavioral problems, and even low self esteem issues. Signs Your Child May Need an Eye Exam There are several signs parents should look for that may indicate a child is struggling with their vision: Frequent squinting or rubbing of the eyes Sitting very close to the TV or holding devices close to the face Tilting the head to one side Covering one eye Difficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading close work Losing place while reading Trouble differentiating colors Clumsiness or poor hand eye coordination Headaches or eye pain after visual tasks If you observe any of these symptoms, schedule an eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist who specializes in pediatric patients. An exam can identify issues like nearsightedness, farsightedness, lazy eye, convergence problems, and other disorders. Protecting Your Child’s Vision Health Along with regular eye exams, there are several ways parents can help maintain healthy eyesight: Ensure your child wears 100% UV blocking sunglasses outside Limit screen time and take frequent breaks from ‘near work’ Provide a nutritious diet with eye healthy vitamins Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure Following your eye doctor’s specialized treatment plan is also essential to managing any vision conditions your child is diagnosed with. The Benefits of Annual Eye Exams Getting your child’s eyes checked every year is a critical piece of preventive healthcare. At annual exams, optometrists and ophthalmologists thoroughly evaluate vision acuity, eye alignment, and eye health. Treehouse Eyes optometrists go a step further by measuring axial length to determine if myopia is present or not. This allows early detection of refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness) as well as other eye disorders like amblyopia or strabismus, which require prompt treatment. Catching and addressing issues early improves outcomes and treats the issues rather than just correcting them with glasses. Annual exams also screen for eye diseases and conditions that rarely show apparent symptoms in kids, like glaucoma. Preventing and controlling these disorders protects long term vision. Treehouse Eyes is proud to join in Children’s Eye Health and Safety Month by helping educate families about protecting one of their child’s most precious gifts the ability to see the world clearly. By scheduling comprehensive eye exams each year and remaining vigilant for signs of vision issues, parents can ensure their child’s visual development stays on track.

Blog Information Do Your Eyes Grow?Do Your Eyes Grow? August 28, 2023 by Lumen Optometric The Complex Relationship Between Eye Growth and Myopia Development The human eye is a remarkably dynamic organ that undergoes natural growth and changes over a lifetime. One key factor that significantly impacts eye development is myopia, also known as nearsightedness. Myopia occurs when the eyeball elongates (grows too long) from front to back, causing light rays to focus incorrectly and distant objects to appear blurry. This eye growth is driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Research shows myopia is becoming more prevalent globally, affecting around 30% of the world’s population, with an estimated 50% by the year 2050. Theories for this increase include frequent near work on digital devices homework and less time outdoors early in life. Both can strain the visual system and put the eyes at risk for abnormal elongation. When myopia develops, the implications go beyond the need for vision correction. Excessive eye growth is linked to a higher risk of blinding conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment later in life. Myopia also reduces the quality of life, at school, when playing sports, participating in extracurriculars, and activities requiring distance vision like driving. So what proactive steps can be taken to support healthy eye development and reduce the odds of myopia onset? The most important step you can take is to get your child a yearly eye exam. This ensures that their vision is being monitored and tracked in case of issues like myopia. Below are a few other tips to help support your child’s eye health. Increase time outdoors, especially in early childhood. Avoid chronic use of screens mobile devices at young ages Maintain clear focus on distant objects through activities like sports Get regular eye exams to monitor for signs of abnormal growth Eat a nutritious diet and nutrients that may support ocular health Understand your genetic predispositions and family history The key is taking preventive actions early. Though myopia itself cannot be reversed once manifested, slowing or even stopping the progression is possible. Implementing healthy lifestyle habits and frequent eye assessments allows for early intervention against excessive eye growth in children. So do your eyes grow? Yes. Just like all other parts of the body, your eyes grow as well. Where issues occur is when the eyeball grows too long from front to back (a.k.a. Myopia), resulting in blurred distance vision.

Myopia Symptoms and How To Treat December 2, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Treehouse Eyes is a specialty pediatric eye care practice treating myopic children with a nationwide network of doctors. Recently, doctors in our Treehouse Eyes community had the chance to spread the word about myopia with local media coverage. Our doctors are passionate about spreading awareness about the myopia epidemic and how early intervention can mean a lot for your child’s eye health. Explore some of the topics our peers covered in recent interviews. How To Tell If Your Child Is Nearsighted It’s not always simple to detect whether or not your child is nearsighted. Watching out for the common symptoms of myopia is key to determine whether or not your child needs treatment. Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Aimee Jacobs OD, discusses some signs to look out for. Dr. Jacobs explains, “If they’re having trouble focusing in school, if they can’t stay on task, if it seems like it might be a behavior issue, a lot of times it’s because they can’t see what they’re doing or they can’t see what they’re doing well enough to focus on it.” Screen Time As a Risk Factor As screen time increases, so does the early onset of myopia. Treehouse Eyes has observed a 30 percent increase in the number of myopic children being treated since the pandemic began. Dr. Tiffany Martinez recalls the effects of the pandemic on children, “During the pandemic we saw a lot more kids they we saw become myopic than we did before.” This is due to the decreased time outdoors and increase in near work. Another Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Ryan Stybel describes the effects of too much ‘near work’, “Screen time or near work is causing myopia to start at an earlier age but also progress more rapidly.” He then goes on to explain the implications of COVID isolation, “We’re just getting through a pandemic, myopia is an epidemic especially with the increased screen time and virtual learning. Limiting screen time is a very important thing and taking frequent breaks and spending time outdoors. We recommend 90 minutes a day outdoors to use the natural sunlight and looking at distance objects can be beneficial and help their eyes from getting worse.” What To Look For As a Parent: Myopia is a treatable and preventable disease, annual eye exams are highly recommended because often times children are unable to articulate their symptoms to a parent. Dr. Denise Smith, a Treehouse Eyes doctor featured on KVUE TV in Austin, Texas provides some tips on how to detect myopia, “Parents can be looking for if the child is squinting, if they can’t see the board at school they might be complaining of headaches, or holding books closer to their face holding their phone closer, maybe getting closer to the television.” So why is it essential to go through myopia management and treatment rather than just getting glasses? Dr. Smith explains why myopia treatment is critical, “If the child is diagnosed with myopia, just getting glasses can help them see clearly, but will not do anything to stop the progression or prevent the eyeball from getting longer. So you want to be able to have those specialized treatments to actually stop that process which in turn can prevent sight threatening disorders later on.” Let Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia Treating myopia early is crucial to prevent children’s vision from getting worse. Our mission is to give children better vision for life so children can have a life advantage to being able to participate in more activities. Myopia management also provides a lower risk for future vision related disease such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataracts.

Blog Information Does Myopia Get Worse with Age?Does Myopia Get Worse with Age? April 10, 2023 by Lumen Optometric What Is Myopia? Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a common vision problem that will affect half the world’s population by 2050. It occurs when the eye is unable to focus on distant objects without corrective lenses like glasses or contacts. Myopia is caused by a variety of factors, including genetic and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. Is Myopia Genetic? If you’re thinking about myopia, knowing if it’s genetic is essential. If you happen to be myopic, then your kids might be at risk of developing the same condition. Myopia has two types: genetic and non genetic (or “acquired”). Genetic myopia is passed down through families and tends to run in certain clusters or patterns. Non genetic means that individuals develop their vision issues without any family history or a genetic predisposition toward poor vision. In general, suppose both parents have healthy eyesight but have children with poor vision (without any other eye problems). It’s likely that those kids were born with a form of genetic myopia known as Axial Myopia (AM). About half of all cases fall into this category! Why Does Myopia Get Worse with Age? When you find out your child is first diagnosed with myopia, it is essential to intervene as early as possible. Myopia progresses when a child’s eye grows too long from front to back, causing permanent and irreversible eye growth, known as axial elongation (the measure of the eye from front to back). When a Treehouse Eyes doctor finds a low level of myopia (nearsightedness), it’s easier to treat with a wider range of treatment options. In short, myopia changes as we age due to axial length elongation that occurs during childhood. The longer the eyeball gets, it’s associated with serious eye conditions that can lead to permanent vision loss such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts. This is why it is imperative to treat myopia as early as possible and start getting your child’s eye examined annually to catch any changes in their vision. How to Stop Myopia from Getting Worse with Age To prevent myopia from getting worse with age, it’s important to get your child regular eye exams and see the treatment options for myopia such as custom contact lenses or prescription eye drops. If you’re concerned about your eyesight, it’s always a good idea to schedule an appointment with a Treehouse Eyes optometrist. Conclusion Myopia is a common vision problem that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by a variety of factors, including genetics and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. The key to properly treating myopia and preventing it from worsening is by catching it early, typically in childhood. By following the tips mentioned above, you can help prevent myopia from getting worse and maintain good eye health.

There is some debate about whether myopia is a disease or a refractive error. The answer is uncovered by how myopia is defined and measured. What Is The Definition Of A Disease? The Review of provides a few definitions of disease to consider: A disease is any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional state of an organism, generally associated with certain signs and symptoms and differing in nature from physical injury. (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020) A disease is an abnormal condition affecting a living organism. Diseases are generally understood to be medical conditions that involve a pathological process associated with a specific set of symptoms. (Infectious Disease News, 2019) Myopia, also called nearsightedness or shortsightness, is the inability to see objects at a distance and is the most common vision issue amongst children and adults. Myopia’s main symptom is blurry distance vision; however, the physiological implications of myopia is that the eyeball itself grows too long from front to back, see figure 1 below. Is Myopia Curable? The question of whether or not myopia is curable helps illustrate why myopia is a disease. Treehouse Eyes doctor, Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. addresses the common question, “Can myopia be cured?” Myopia is not curable, but it can be treated. “Unfortunately, once myopia happens, which happens due to the eyeball growing too long, it is impossible to shrink it afterwards. When myopia occurs, it is permanent and irreversible.” Dr. Mai then goes on to explain the importance of early intervention, “We can prevent high levels of myopia which are associated with diseases such as macular maculopathy and retinal detachment. Starting treatment early is critical because there is no cure for myopia and once a child is diagnosed with this disease, it typically gets worse if left untreated.” Myopia is a disease that can be treated at the source by providing children with treatment options, rather than just giving a child glasses for the symptom of myopia which is blurry vision. Myopia Is a Disease Although myopia has symptoms like blurry vision, that aren’t caused by physical injury, myopia itself is caused by the eye growing too long. In other words, the axial length increases outside of the normal rate for a child’s age. See Figure 2 below. Image Source The elongation of the eye is the core issue. Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. details, “The greater the myopia, the longer the axial length of the eye and thus greater risk. Myopia is clearly a disease. One that requires treatment to reduce the negative impact it can have on a person’s eye health and vision.” Myopia is a significant, prevalent disease in children with increasing rates of progression. There are also two types of classifications: non pathologic and pathologic myopia. How is Myopia Treated?

The goal of this procedure is to reduce myopia or nearsightedness of patients. To know more about Ortho K and what to expect, here is a list of frequently asked questions. 1\\\\. “Are there age restrictions for Ortho K?” None. Children as young as six years old have been treated with Ortho K lenses. In fact, the treatment is one of the most common methods of vision correction in pre teens and teens. 2\\\\. “Who is considered a good candidate?” Ortho K proves to be an effective treatment for farsighted, nearsighted and astigmatic patients. If your child has been unable to wear contact lenses, due to discomfort or allergies, they make a good candidate. This is because Ortho K lenses are easy to use and can be worn while sleeping. 3\\\\. “How do Ortho K lenses differ from typical lenses?” Ortho K contact lenses are specifically designed with highly oxygen permeable material. The back surface of the lens is particularly made to enable the reshaping of the corneal tissue. 4\\\\. “How long does it take to reach good vision?” Stable vision can be achieved after 10 14 days of treatment, depending on the prescription. In fact, 50 70% of the desired visual correction is attained after the first night of wear. 5\\\\. “How long can Ortho K provide myopia control?” The effect of myopia control should last as long as your use of Ortho K lenses. It is advisable for young children to wear the lenses until their late teens when myopia tends to destabilize. Fortunately, there are no anecdotal reports from patients that state ‘rebounding’ after their use of ortho K contact lenses has come to an end. To get started with Ortho K treatment, it is essential to contact a trusted eye exam doctor.

This is especially true with the pandemic upheaving our lives and forcing us to stay home for virtual learning or work from home. The consequences are not just limited to heightened obesity rates. Studies have shown that having less sunlight could actually change the ways that a child’s eyes develop, resulting in a myopia epidemic that rises in tandem with the obesity crisis. You need to encourage your child to spend more time outdoors to protect their eyesight and prevent myopia. Downsides of Spending Time Indoors According to a recent Australian study, kids who spend only about 20 minutes per day outdoors experience quicker growth in the length of their eyes than those who log more hours in bright eyes. This can result in myopia and trouble seeing faraway objects. Thankfully, there are some ways available that you can still use to keep an eye on your child’s eyesight. They are listed as follows. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Encourage Outdoor Time Our eyes need an optimal amount of bright light that can be gotten from outdoors. Therefore, by aiming for around 40 minutes of outdoor time daily, not only can your children get the physical activity that they need that day, but it can also be beneficial to their eyes and help to prevent the onset of myopia. Look out for Warning Signs It is important to look out for warning signs that your child might have myopia so that they can get treated for it early. Children suffering from myopia may squint, constantly feel the need to rub their eyes or complain of consistent headaches, they may also start having trouble with their academic grades. If your child experiences any of these symptoms, it is important to schedule an appointment with an optometrist. Schedule Regular Screenings To help prevent or manage myopia, it is important to have regular eye screenings for your child. Doctors recommend yearly vision screenings either by your child’s pediatrician or their school as well as a vision screen at well child visits through age 4. Newborn babies should also have their vision tested before they leave the hospital, and before your child hits the age of 5, it is important to take them to a pediatric ophthalmologist for a thorough checkup if they are suffering from any vision concerns or have a family history of vision concerns. If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood.

But how much do you really know about this progressive eye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll explore 4 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about your child’s eye health and long term vision. Myopia is an Eye Disease Myopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. As this happens, the symptoms of the disease are blurry distance vision. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. To help combat this, we recommend eye exams every six months to track myopia progress. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye disease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people worldwide. We are currently on pace to have half of the world’s population with some degree of myopia by the year 2050! Indoor time, excessive ‘near work’, and genetic factors all play a role in the growth of myopia. Education For Their Future Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development when they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease Myopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight threatening eye diseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50% higher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop cataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults than children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of clear vision a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided their children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic maculopathy fell by 40%.

Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. It can affect both children and adults, with over 50% of American teenagers being myopic according to this journal. Here are some ways to recognize the signs and symptoms of myopia in children. Consistent Headaches Headaches can be a common system of vision problems, it is important to track how often your child is experiencing symptoms of headaches. Some headaches may be a result of allergy symptoms or pressure changes, but they could also be a direct result of nearsightedness. If your child is experiencing more than one headache per week, do schedule an appointment with an optometrist or pediatrician to try and get your vision checked for myopia. Excessive Eye Watering Excessive eye watering can also be a symptom of myopia, given that it can result in discomfort in the eyes. If your child experiences consistent and excessive eye watering, do schedule an appointment with an optometrist to get your vision checked. Excessive Squinting If your child is squinting excessively, it might also be a symptom of myopia. This is due to the fact that humans suffering from myopia squint as a result in changes in the tension of their eye muscles, providing them with brief clarity of vision. Thereby, it should be easy to spot individual suffering from nearsightedness if he or she engages in excessive squinting. Holding Objects Close to Their Face Another glaring symptom to look for if wondering is if your child constantly holds objects closer to their face to see them properly. This is a clear symptom of nearsightedness which may be caused by excessive usage of screen time. Consistent Rubbing Of Eyes When dealing with a young child that might potentially have myopia, they might often rub their eyes as a sign of discomfort. If you notice that your child excessively and consistently rubs their eyes, it might be a sign to schedule a consultation with the optometrist to have their vision assessed. Sitting Very Close to the TV You might find your child sitting too close to the TV than they normally do. The most apparent sign that your child may have myopia, especially for older kids, is if they grumble about the images on the TV screen looking unclear or blurry, or if they tell you they have issues reading the words shown on screens.

This is unfortunate as your eye health and visual acuity have a major impact on your overall well being and quality of life. . In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric shares some simple eye health tips for young adults. Take a Break When Using Digital Devices Young adults tend to spend a lot of time on their digital devices. Unfortunately, staring at a computer or phone screen for too long can make the eyes feel dry and tired, eventually causing blurred vision. This is because people tend to blink less when staring at a digital screen. To avoid digital eye strain, you need to give your eyes frequent breaks. You can do this by following the 20 20 20 rule: after 20 minutes of screen time, look at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds to give your eyes a break. Practice Good Contact Lens Hygiene If you wear contact lenses, it’s critical to observe proper hygiene to avoid eye infections. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses and keep water away from your contacts. Use fresh contact lens disinfecting solution every time. Always wash your hands with soap and water and then dry them with a clean cloth before touching your contact lenses. Most importantly, follow your eye doctor’s recommendations about replacing your contact lenses. Don’t wear a pair of contact lenses beyond their scheduled replacement date. Lead a Healthy Lifestyle The three most important things you can do to safeguard your vision are maintaining a healthy diet, exercising often and avoiding smoking. Leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing eye diseases like age related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and diabetic retinopathy. You should also practice good sleeping habits. Lack of sleep can adversely affect your health in many ways.

In our technologically driven world, conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism are becoming increasingly prevalent among children. This article will unpack these conditions, helping you understand what they are, how they differ, and most importantly, what you can do to manage and treat them. The Differences Between Myopia and Astigmatism Myopia results when your eye grows too long from front to back, causing light to focus before it reaches the retina. If a normal eye is shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye may more closely resemble a football. In contrast, astigmatism is usually due to an irregularly shaped cornea or lens. Myopia primarily affects distance vision, while astigmatism affects vision at all distances. Both conditions can coexist in one eye, and they often do. This combination can further complicate vision, making it crucial to address both issues. Combining Science and a Child Centric Approach At Treehouse Eyes®, we combine robust, science backed data with inspiring aesthetics for both children and parents alike. We’ve created an environment that children love, helping to alleviate the fear sometimes associated with medical appointments. Our team of experts provides thorough eye examinations using the latest technology, identifying refractive errors and other eye health issues early. We then create a personalized treatment plan that suits the needs and lifestyle of your child. Myopia and astigmatism are common eye conditions that can affect children of all ages. If your child has been diagnosed with either of these conditions, it’s important to seek early treatment to protect their vision and prevent further complications.

If this is the case, you may feel relieved about this, but does it really mean you have perfect vision? To answer this, we’ll first explain the related vision terminology to help you understand how we measure your vision’s quality. Visual Acuity Visual acuity is the term used to express the clarity or sharpness of your vision. This is measured by your ability to identify the letters or numbers on a standardized eye chart while standing at a certain distance. So, for instance, if you have 20 20 vision, you can see clearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance. Similarly, if you have 20 100 vision, it must mean that you can see as close as 20 feet to see what those with 20 20 vision normally see at 100 feet. 20 20 vision doesn’t always mean your eyesight is perfect. For instance, if you’re getting nearsighted, we may recommend that you use our orthokeratology lenses to slow its progression. But then this only indicates how sharp and clear your vision is at a distance. There are also other vision skills that are just as important, such as eye coordination, side vision, focusing ability, color vision, and depth perception. The Snellen visual acuity system is named after the Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, who developed the system in 1862. The system uses acuity measurements in fractions of 20 20, 20 40, 20 60, and so on. The numerator or the top number of the Snellen fraction is the distance between the eye chart and the patient. In the U.S., the viewing distance is usually 20 feet while in other countries, it’s 6 meters. Meanwhile, the bottom number of the fraction corresponds to the visual acuity of the patient. Higher numbers mean less clarity and sharpness in eyesight. For instance, the Big “E” that you see in most Snellen eye charts corresponds to 20 200 visual acuity. If this is the only letter you can discern, then there’s a chance that you may be legally blind unless prescribed with corrective contact lenses. The Factors and Limits The major factors that determine visual acuity are as follows: 1\\\\. The accuracy of how the lens and cornea of the eye focuses light onto the retina 2\\\\. The sensitivity of the nerves in the retina and vision centers in the brain 3\\\\. The ability of the brain to interpret information received from the eyes Visual acuity tests are quite useful in measuring the clarity of your eyesight in standardized conditions, it’s not completely accurate in determining the overall quality of your vision. Some of its limitations are that it can’t measure how well you see colored objects, moving objects, or objects that are similar in brightness to their background.

Blog Information What Is The Difference Between Myopia and Hyperopia?What Is The Difference Between Myopia and Hyperopia? June 15, 2023 by Morris Ilagan When it comes to common vision disorders, myopia and hyperopia are often confused. In the article, we’ll dive deep into these distinct vision impairments, understand their distinctive characteristics, and explore current treatment modalities. Understanding Myopia and Hyperopia Myopia, also referred to as nearsightedness, is a vision condition whose symptoms are blurry distance vision. This is a result of the eye growing too long from front to back leading to blurry vision when looking at faraway objects. On the other hand, hyperopia, or farsightedness, is the opposite. Distant objects are clear, but those up close appear blurry. This condition occurs when the eye is too short from front to back, or the cornea is too flat, leading to light focusing behind the retina. Diagnosis and Differences The diagnosis of both conditions involves scheduling a routine eye exam – especially one trained to spot myopia like the doctors at Treehouse Eyes. These exams include visual acuity tests, refraction assessments, and eye health evaluations. Be sure that your eyecare provider is measuring your child’s axial length to ensure an accurate diagnosis of myopia. Axial length will measure how long the eye is front to back. Notably, the critical difference between myopia and hyperopia lies in their distinct symptoms and the way they affect vision. People with myopia often have difficulty viewing road signs, and whiteboards, or watching a movie at a cinema or at home. In contrast, those with hyperopia may struggle with tasks like reading, using a smartphone, doing homework, and other times where closer vision is necessary. Treatment Modalities Fortunately, both myopia and hyperopia are manageable with several treatment options. The key for both, but especially myopia, is early detection and treatment. Myopia is a disease that typically develops in children (ages 6 – 12) and continues through puberty until the child stops growing. This can sometimes be well into adulthood (25 years old in some cases) which is why early treatment and prevention are key to slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. For children, orthokeratology, or Ortho K, is a potential treatment. It involves the use of specially designed gas permeable contact lenses that temporarily reshape the cornea to help treat your childs myopia. Recent studies suggest that certain types of multifocal contact lenses may slow the progression of myopia in children. Furthermore, low dose atropine eye drops have shown promising results in minimizing the advancement of myopia. Conclusion Understanding the differences between myopia and hyperopia is vital in recognizing the need for a timely eye exam and appropriate treatment. Through modern optometry, children are now able to receive the treatment and care they need to improve their vision and quality of life. Remember, regular eye examinations are critical to detect any visual impairments at an early stage. If your child is experiencing any changes in their vision, contact your local Treehouse Eyes doctor. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child. Our treatment plans include special prescription eye drops and customized daytime and overnight contact lenses.

Still, it can also bring a host of changes to your vision. As the hormones in your body change and fluctuate during this period, you may experience various eye related issues that can affect how clearly you see or make your eyes uncomfortable It’s good to be aware of these common changes and take steps to protect your vision throughout pregnancy. Common Vision Changes During Pregnancy Here’s what you can expect: Dry Eyes – Many women experience dry eyes during pregnancy due to hormonal fluctuations. It usually happens around mid pregnancy when hormone levels are at their highest point and decreases after delivery as hormone levels return to normal. Blurry Vision – During pregnancy, it is not uncommon for women’s eyesight to become blurry or cloudy due to their changing hormones. It should resolve itself once their hormone levels return to normal after childbirth. Light Sensitivity – Some pregnant women find themselves more sensitive than usual when exposed to bright lights, such as sunlight or fluorescent lighting in stores or office buildings, which can cause discomfort. Floaters – Small spots may appear in front of one’s field of vision, known as floaters. These tend to increase with age but may temporarily worsen during pregnancy because many people become dehydrated while expecting a baby. Glaucoma – Women with a family history of glaucoma are at higher risk for developing it during the later stages of their pregnancies, so regular checkups with an optometrist will help ensure that any potential problems are caught early on before causing further damage. Eye Health During Pregnancy Here are some tips for protecting vision during pregnancy: Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables high in vitamins A and C. Drink plenty of fluids, like water, every day. Wear sunglasses outdoors if needed. Get regular checkups from an optometrist throughout all trimesters. Rest often and get adequate sleep each night. Manage stress by taking breaks from work, exercising regularly, etc. Why You Should Get Checked If pregnant women fail to protect their vision, they risk serious complications such as premature birth, miscarriage and gestational diabetes. Regular optometrist visits are essential to catch any potential problems before they become more severe.

If your eyes are misaligned, however, your brain struggles to maintain balance. Without this balance, you could experience constant headaches, migraines, tension in and around your eyes, dizziness and even neck stiffness. Add misalignment to the strenuous demands that computer screens, phones and other digital devices place on your visual system, and you could face daily suffering. Fortunately, 10 years of research into headaches and their associated visual symptoms has yielded the revolutionary neurolens treatment. Neurolens therapy helps correct misalignment at the distance where you need the most help. Whether you struggle to see far away or up close, Lumen Optometric can provide customized neurolenses that correct your specific misalignment and give you the most comfortable vision possible. Lumen Optometric is proud to offer this exciting new technology and we’d love to help you discover relief for your symptoms! Check out the following video for a neurolens overview, and then read on for answers to some of the FAQs we receive. Neurolens FAQ What makes this any different than the glasses I wore in the past? The difference is in the technology and the visual experience. Neurolenses utilize patented, clinically tested technology to correct your misalignment at your prescribed working distance. There is no lens on the market that offers the same technology. And Lumen Optometric keeps several sets of neurolens prescriptions on hand, so if you are a candidate for a neurolens treatment, you’ll have the opportunity to see and feel the neurolens difference at the end of your exam! How do you measure my misalignment? Lumen Optometric utilizes a sophisticated instrument called the SightSync to measure your eye misalignment at varying distances. Coupled with specialized in office testing, your eye measurements allow us to create a lens that helps with your specific symptoms. How quickly can I expect my symptoms to improve? Most Lumen Optometric patients notice an improvement within the week, although patients with extremely chronic conditions may require six to eight weeks to notice an improvement. Are there any side effects to the neurolenses? First time neurolens wearers typically report feeling lighter, as if there’s less burden on their heads, necks, shoulders and eyes.

It’s possible with Orthokeratology (Ortho K) from Lumen Optometric. Ortho K is an FDA approved, non surgical treatment that corrects your vision by gently reshaping your eyes while you sleep. In the morning, you simply remove your custom Ortho K lenses and experience clear vision all day! ORTHOKERATOLOGY FOR ADULTS: One of the biggest breakthroughs in correcting your myopia (aka nearsightedness) or hyperopia (aka farsightedness) is a process called Orthokeratology, or Ortho K, for short. It is a revolutionary system that accomplishes three things it corrects your vision while you sleep, removes the need for daytime distance glasses contacts, and allows you to avoid dryness, irritation, or allergies with traditional contacts. HOW IT KEEPS YOUR EYES HEALTHY: Relative to wearing soft contacts, which are worn for a period of 12 18 hours a day, Ortho K lenses are only worn while you sleep, so the overall wear time is much less. Additionally, these lenses are only worn under clean conditions (you’re at home!) so there’s much less of a chance of allergies and virus bacterial deposits. HOW IT GIVES YOU CLEAR VISION: You wear a special retainer like lens to sleep and upon waking, you remove the lenses. When the lenses are off, you will be able to see clearly for the rest of the day. Glasses or traditional contacts will never have to be worn again for the distance so long as you wear your Ortho K lenses to bed every night. Depending on your needs for reading, Ortho K can be modified to enhance your reading vision, but reading glasses might still be needed depending on your age and intensity of your near work. WHAT ELSE MAKES ORTHO K UNIQUE? Ortho K is only worn while in the comfort and cleanliness of your own home so you will never have to worry about losing breaking tearing glasses contacts while at work or participating in sports. It is a great option for farsighted patients who are having trouble adapting to wearing glasses. Additionally, it is also a wonderful option for athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, or patients with dry eyes or severe allergies who can no longer tolerate soft contact lenses.

Candidacy Our Technology Frequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens Exams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID 19 Protocols Videos About Us Office Testimonials Blog Candidacy Orthokeratology Candidacy To determine if you are a candidate for Ortho K, a few things must be considered: your visual needs expectations, eye health, type and level of prescription, hours of sleep, and willingness to participate. There are no age requirements. I HAVE MYOPIA (aka NEARSIGHTEDNESS) WHAT IT MEANS: You were prescribed glasses for the distance (driving, TV, anything greater than a couple feet away). At a certain prescription, you see better up close without your glasses contacts. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t need to put on glasses to see in the distance any longer! *For those of you who are myopic but need reading help with progressive lenses, Ortho K can also be built with a reading enhancement to aid with reading. I HAVE ASTIGMATISM IT’S COMPLICATED: Astigmatism can occur with both myopia and hyperopia WHAT IT MEANS: You see slightly distortion and shadows without your glasses, which you might wear for both distance and near. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t experience the distortion nor shadows! I HAVE HYPEROPIA (AKA FARSIGHTEDNESS) Farsightedness is more complicated, it breaks down into two categories (simplified for this web format) CATEGORY 1: You’re farsighted and only have trouble with reading. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has been fairly clear for your whole life, but upon landing in your 40 50s, you find that you now need reading glasses. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t need reading glasses for most tasks and your distance will likely subtly improve. CATEGORY 2: You’re farsighted and have trouble with both reading and the distance. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has been clear up until your 30 40s, but now you need glasses for both distance and near. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: This scenario is the most life changing for patients! Ortho k essentially reverses your visual experience by about 20 years, back to a time when you were able to wake up seeing 100% clear. Other eye health factors need to be taken into account before initiating Orthokeratology. During an Ortho K consult, one of our doctors will review your complete visual and systemic health to ensure you’re a good candidate.

Candidacy Our Technology Frequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens Exams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID 19 Protocols Videos About Us Office Testimonials Blog Frequently Asked Questions Orthokeratology Frequently Asked Questions Below are the top ten most frequently asked questions. We have a longer list that can be emailed as well. I just have to sleep in these lenses to see clearly? Yes, the lenses gently mold your eyes while you sleep. As long as you sleep in the lenses for a continuous 6 8 hours, your vision will reach full, waking hour clarity within a 1 2 week time frame. So what do I wear in the meantime in those first 1 2 weeks? During your transition period and depending on the size type of your prescription, you will be given soft contacts or loaner glasses to ease the transition. What can I expect during the first 1 2 weeks? Your vision will become clearer day by day, and the clarity will last longer and longer with each passing day. But during the first couple of weeks, your vision will go from clear to your original level of blurriness by the day’s end. The period of blurriness decreases with each day until full clarity is reached. How does the lens feel? The lens is made with a more rigid material, so initially it’s more noticeable and requires a little more adaptation. The good news is that since the lenses are inserted right before bedtime, most of the adaptation takes place while you sleep! How long does the Ortho K effect last after the initial transition period? The vision correcting effect is programmed to last for ~24 hours, but some patients can experience clear vision for 36 hours without having to rewear the lens. How long your vision remains clear after 24 hours depends on the size of your prescription. Is vision clear while I’m wearing the Ortho k lenses? Yes, vision is very clear with the lenses on. They are designed not only to mold the cornea, but to also give you clear vision if you have to wake up in the middle of the night (for the restroom, emergency evacuations, etc). What happens if I miss a night? Patients with lower prescriptions don’t notice an obvious difference the next day, but patients with higher prescriptions will notice blurriness in the distance. Computer tasks for patients are definitely workable if you miss a night, but night driving is not recommended. Soft contacts can be given to you to make up for any residual blur. What happens if I decide to stop Ortho K? Your vision returns to normal over 2 3 weeks, sometimes faster. Are there any side effects to Ortho K? Glare is the primary side effect, which occurs with any refractive procedure such as LASIK PRK SMILE etc as well. Glare tends to be more noticeable in the initial adaptation period, which lasts 1 2 months. After that period, the brain learns to adapt and filter out residual glare. I thought it was unhealthy to sleep in contacts? Patients are told not to sleep in traditional contacts because they’re worn throughout the day, throughout sleep, and again in the daytime for a minimum of at least 30 hours of wear time. Additionally, debris germs mucus accumulate on traditional lenses, which your eye is then exposed to for the 30+ hours of wear. With Ortho K, you only wear them for a period of 7 8 hours maximum while under clean, home conditions.

Orthokeratology How’s Ortho K Work? Ortho K works somewhat similarly to a retainer for teeth in that they are worn overnight, but the similarities stop there. Ortho K works by gently reshaping the front surface of the eye (the cornea) while you sleep. The retainer lenses are inserted right before bedtime and removed after waking. Because the lenses are designed to correct your vision overnight, you will wake up with vision that will remain clear throughout your waking hours. The lenses are then re worn nightly to maintain clear vision. Recent advances in technology have allowed us to design Ortho K lenses that are created 100% from the shape of your eye. The custom nature of the lens allows for a healthier fitment.

Medmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300” being the gold standard topographer for over a decade. Their newest topographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more accurately capturing your cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your eye, which yields faster, healthier, and clearer outcomes. WAVE CUSTOM LENS DESIGN Lumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles County that employs WAVE to create 100% fully custom lenses for your eyes. WAVE combines all the topographical (corneal shape) data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and manipulate every aspect of your lens design. Custom design software is extremely critical for both clarity and eye health because each point of the lens is based on information from your cornea. Tip for inquiring patients – If you are told that you’re being fitted with custom lenses, ask to see your design. It should look similar to the screenshot above. If a doctor touts that they’re fitting a custom lens but is unable to show you a screenshot like the above where they can manipulate every aspect of every curve, they’re not designing a custom lens. All doctors will refer to their lenses as custom, but it is actually quite rare because of the difficult training, complicated CAD software, and cutting edge equipment that is required.

Scleral lenses are specialty, custom molded lenses that bring clear and comfortable vision to patients with corneal issues such as keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, or post LASIK complications. If your vision and comfort are lacking because of these complications, don’t settle. Sclerals represent the gold standard keratoconus treatment that is non surgical. Dr. Eric To is the only practice owning optometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society. We’d love for you to experience effortless vision, so reach out and let Lumen Optometric restore clarity and comfort to your vision. Scleral FAQs As a leading scleral optometrist, Lumen Optometric has the information you need. To give our valued patients more detailed insight about scleral lenses, we’ve compiled a convenient list of FAQs. What are scleral lenses? Scleral lenses are large diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (the clear window of the eye) and gently rest on the sclera (the white, outer layer of the eye). The rigid nature of the lenses makes your vision extremely crisp. Scleral lenses should not be confused with traditional gas permeable (GP) lenses. Traditional GP lenses are small lenses made of durable plastic that sit on the extremely sensitive cornea. Conversely, scleral lenses tend to be much more comfortable because they settle on the less sensitive sclera. Who is a candidate for scleral lenses? Many patients can benefit from scleral lenses, especially those suffering from: Keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration Higher prescriptions & visual needs that aren’t met by glasses or soft contacts Dry eyes, with or without soft contacts Glare distortion after LASIK, PRK or corneal transplants Exacting visual demands from things like sports, videography & photography Will I see a difference between scleral lenses and soft contact lenses? Scleral lens prescriptions offer greater vision and comfort than soft contact lenses because: Scleral lenses are built from highly customizable materials that offer the clearest, most stable vision correction. Scleral lenses sit on the less sensitive part of the eye and are inherently more stable. Scleral lenses offer options that make them more customizable for full distance clarity or for improved reading vision. Do all eye doctors fit scleral lenses? Not all eye doctors fit scleral lenses, but Lumen Optometric specializes in advanced scleral fitting! Our talented scleral optometrist uses an sMap3D instrument to capture a full 3D representation of your frontal eye. That custom scan helps us build a Scleral 2.0 lens that accurately fits your eye. Lumen Optometric is the only provider in the San Gabriel Valley to offer this state of the art technology, and we liken the process to creating a 100% custom made suit. Like a tailor designing a suit based on every measurement of your body, Lumen Optometric creates a scleral lens that is more accurate and a healthier fit for your eyes. What is a Scleral 2.0 lens? Traditional sclerals, or scleral 1.0 lenses, have been used for roughly a decade. The newer, more technologically advanced Scleral 2.0 lenses are customized specifically for your eye. So while creating a Scleral 2.0 lens is comparable to designing a custom made suit, fitting scleral 1.0 lenses is similar to modifying an off the rack suit: you select a suit size that approximates your body shape and make a limited number of adjustments to help the suit drape over your body’s contours. Our mission at Lumen Optometric is to aim for a flawless fit with your scleral lenses, not a best guess approximation. Check out these videos to see what a difference customized scleral lenses can make! What’s it like to be fit with Scleral 2.0 lenses? An advanced scleral lens fitting starts with both corneal and scleral topography. A corneal topographer maps the cornea, the clear window of the eye. Scleral topography is a separate, dedicated instrument that can scan the elevation changes of your eye’s white surface. This painless procedure does not require dilation drops, but it does require the use of a temporary dye that enhances our scans. We then place a calibrated “test” scleral lens on your eye. That test lens gives you an opportunity to try out a scleral lens and gives us time to fine tune your prescription. Once your prescription data is obtained, it’s combined with the shape data to create your fully customized scleral lens. Please note that during a scleral lens consultation, we take all necessary measurements of your eye. Be prepared to set aside 60 minutes of eye doctor time to ensure that the measurements are correct. What is the best keratoconus treatment for me? Or if I have pellucid marginal degeneration or any other condition where the cornea is no longer consistent in its shape (post LASIK RK corneal transplant), how will sclerals help me? Sclerals are the best keratoconus treatment available, they’re the gold standard! They will give you clear, distortion free vision. Think of an irregular cornea as the warped windshield of a car. That warping distorts what you see through the windshield, leading to extreme glare in addition to distorted vision. When you fill a custom scleral lens with conditioning solution and apply it to your eye, the solution “mates” the scleral with your cornea to give you a new, smooth, regular surface to see through. This perfectly contoured surface cancels out your distortion and blur, leaving you with clear and comfortable vision. The outcomes are the same for keratoconus, pellucid, or any other type of corneal irregularity. If I’m already wearing glasses or contacts and I see acceptably, will scleral lenses make a difference? That depends on how you define acceptable. Most people are fairly adaptable to the options they’re given, so until you’re shown a difference, you may not be aware that the potential for improvement exists. For example, if you’ve been wearing the same set of contacts for nearly a decade, there’s a good chance you’re missing out on clearer, healthier and more comfortable technology. Lumen Optometric can keep you up to date on the best and healthiest options for your only set of eyes. The impact of scleral lenses also depends on your prescription. If you have an extremely minimal prescription, scleral lenses will be more helpful in correcting dry eyes or performance based vision. If you have a moderate or high prescription with astigmatism, the benefit of sclerals will be vision that’s clearer and more stable. Visual stability is something many of us take for granted until we are shown what true stability looks like. For example, consider the fluidity of the newer 120hz televisions relative to their older 60hz counterparts. 60hz televisions looked normal to us until the 120hz upgrades were released. When patients have high levels of astigmatism, scleral lenses provide results similar to that of seeing an image on a brand new, high definition television for the first time! Corneal health is another factor to consider. If you have any corneal issues, scleral lenses will significantly impact your vision and improve your quality of life. If my eyes are dry, how can sclerals help me? When you apply a scleral lens to your eye, the “bowl” of the lens is filled with sterile conditioning solution. This conditioning solution is held against your eye for as long as you wear the lens, creating a moisture chamber that helps alleviate your dry eye. Of course, scleral lenses represent only one treatment modality within a greater dry eye treatment system. Severely chronic dry eye patients may need additional treatments to overcome their dryness symptoms, and Lumen Optometric has several dry eye treatment plans available.

Researchers believe that the environment kids grow up in today, with too many close distance activities (like reading and device use) and lack of outdoor play, is contributing to the rapid increase in childhood myopia. While glasses and contact lenses compensate for a child’s blurry vision, they don’t stop your child’s vision from continuing to deteriorate. As children grow, myopia often develops as they reach school age and progresses into their late teens or early twenties. The Dangers of Myopia Researchers now know there is more to worry about with myopic eyes than the inconvenience of ever thickening lenses. Scientific evidence has proven that myopic patients are more vulnerable to a range of sight threatening diseases and complications. In fact, myopia is the sixth leading cause of blindness. Patients with mild myopia have a four fold increase in the risk of retinal detachment. For those with moderate to severe myopia, the risk increases ten times. One study concluded that more than 50 percent of retinal detachments not related to trauma are associated with myopia. Other myopia risks include glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration. Myopia Can Be Managed The dangers of myopia, in conjunction with the normal challenges of subpar vision, mean it is important for parents of myopic children to manage the condition as part of your child’s eye health. The goal of myopia management is to slow the progression of myopia and reduce its impact on your child’s life. The younger myopia management begins, the more effective the treatment. We are excited at Lumen Optometric to announce the launch of our children’s myopia management service in partnership with Treehouse Eyes®, the country’s leading myopia management service. The revolutionary system, designed to treat your child’s myopia and significantly reduce the threat of more serious eye diseases, is one of the most important innovations since glasses were first prescribed hundreds of years ago!

TREEHOUSE EYES® MYOPIA MANAGEMENT FOR CHILDREN Is myopia unhealthy? SO WHY DID THE SCREEN MOVE FURTHER BACK WITH MYOPIC PATIENTS? This is due to the whole eye growing longer in depth, which occurs in myopic patients. This front to back elongation moves the retina (the screen) beyond the point where the cornea (the projector) expects to concentrate its light to a focus. SO WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? When the outer shell of the eye (the sclera) elongates, it forces all the internal components that line the inside of the eye (the retina) to also stretch. There are two problems with an enlarged eye and a stretched retina: Problem #1 – A nuisance Your child has to wear stronger glasses contacts every time their prescription increases. They become dependent on glasses contacts from the moment their eyes open in the morning to when their eyes close for bedtime. Problem #2 – A health concern The stretched retina is thinned and weakened, which leads to a higher risk of blinding eye diseases, such as myopic maculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts.

In the graph above, you will notice that in the 1940s, the prevalence of myopia in this select group of East Asian university students was 10% to 37%. If you fast forward to the present, the prevalence is staggering; it is over 80% to 90%! It is impossible for such a sudden shift to have occurred in the gene pool of those nations so the cause cannot be genetics alone. In looking for the cause of this progression, researchers studied the visual demands of those university students. It was demonstrated that the average student in Shanghai was responsible for 15 hours of homework per week, compared to 6 hours per week in the United States. Even though the prevailing thought that excessive close work leads to more myopia, they found something else more interesting. They found that it was the lack of outdoor time that led to an earlier and more rapid nearsighted progression! One thing that is clear based on the epidemiological studies, and it is that genetics alone cannot account for this explosive myopic epidemic. ARE ELECTRONIC DEVICES HARMING MY CHILD’S EYES? The answer is a complicated “yes.” The logic of excessive screen time worsening vision is sound, but there has been no conclusive evidence that screen time alone contributes to myopic progression. What is known is that with every moment our children are spending time indoors with their eyes glued to screens, they are not spending those moments outdoors. This is where science has stepped in to find a strong correlation between outdoor playtime and the slowed or delayed onset of myopia. Children who spend a couple of hours outdoors every day have been found to be four times less likely to become myopic. Our stance when it comes to screen time is both scientifically driven and rooted in common sense. Being outdoors provides the healthy sunlight our eyes and skin need. It’s also fantastic for both physical and visual development. Being less sedentary and more active outdoors enforces better hand eye coordination, depth perception, and eye coordination skills. All efforts should be made to reduce screen time when possible for these reasons.

Zeiss IOLMaster Optical Biometer An optical biometer is traditionally used by surgeons to perform power calculations for lenses that are to be implanted in the eye. We utilize optical biometry for a different reason: to measure the length of your child’s eye, which is referred to as axial length. As your child grows, their eyes grow as well. Our goal is early detection and differentiation between natural growth of the eye versus accelerated myopic progression. Since a longer eye leads to a stretched retina (which has its own complications as seen in the “Is Myopia Unhealthy” page), it’s critical that we know the rate at which your child’s eyes are growing. Previously, the only known method to monitor the eye’s growth was through the prescription, but each prescription does not correlate with a specific eye length. Typically, prescription changes lag axial length changes, which means that if you only monitor through prescription, chances are that you will miss length changes that may have already occurred. Treehouse Eyes affiliates such as our office are one of the few offices in all of Los Angeles County that employ technology solely to measure axial length for children. Medmont Meridia Corneal Topographer A leading edge topographer is critical to monitor how the cornea (the clear window of the eye) changes over time with myopia treatments. Medmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300” being the gold standard topographer for a decade. Their newest topographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more accurately capturing your child’s cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your child’s eye, which yields faster and better outcomes. Medmont partnered with Lumen Optometric to help launch the new gold standard and we’re proud to be able to offer this latest form of technology to our patients. WAVE Custom Lens Design Lumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles county that employs WAVE to create 100% fully custom lenses for your child. WAVE combines all the topographical data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and manipulate every aspect of your child’s lens design. From a doctor’s perspective, the customizable nature of WAVE allows for (1) maximum myopia management, (2) more accurate vision correction, (3) increasing the level of myopia protection in a lens. For patients, it simply means their eyes are more protected from myopic progression, they see better and arrive at a clear endpoint in less time. Aren’t All Lenses Custom? Depending on the type of lens a practitioner may be limited to (either due to technology or training), their definition of custom will differ. This is an overview of the three different types of “custom” lenses you will encounter as a patient parent. Basic custom – These types of ortho k lenses are similar to off the rack suits in that they come in a predefined size. Depending on your needs, the suit is then upsized or downsized to another predefined size. “Basic custom” ortho k lenses exist in certain parameters and different lenses are selected based on visual estimation. Due to the lack of true personalization, your child can share the same lens design as another patient. Semi custom – This category of ortho k lenses begins to incorporate technology such as topography in the design of the lens. Lens design software will use the topographical data to generate a lens off of an pre established template. To return to the suit analogy, measurements are taken for a suit to be made, but the suits still have certain non modifiable assumptions made about the proportions. And if a suit has to be modified, you still operate within those non modifiable template assumptions. Fully custom – WAVE lenses are all fully custom designs. WAVE lenses incorporate topographical data of the eye which can then be fully manipulated by a Certified WAVE Designer (CWD). Every aspect of the lens can be changed relative to one another, leading to the most form fitting and visually effective lens. We utilize WAVE lenses because our patients see the best out of them! Tip – If a doctor can’t show you the visual layout of your child’s lens design with numerical readouts of those design elements, it’s likely not a fully custom lens. If you point to any one aspect of the design and ask for it to be changed in real time for demonstration, yet it can’t, it’s likely not a fully custom lens. Lastly, fully custom lenses are all doctor designed from start to finish, meaning that the lenses are all designed in house by the same doctor taking care of your child. Basic or semi custom lens designers outsource their change requests to lens consultants. Fully custom lenses require more training to design and troubleshoot, in addition to requiring very specific hardware. We only fit fully custom lenses because they are the healthiest option for your child. Schedule a Consultation to Discuss Lumen Optometric offers consultations to discuss myopia management.

TREEHOUSE EYES® MYOPIA MANAGEMENT FOR CHILDREN What is myopia? WHAT IS MYOPIA & WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT PROGRESSES? When your child is myopic (which leads to nearsightedness), it means that distant objects are blurrier than near objects. To understand why this occurs, let’s first consider how a perfect eye works. Consider when conditions are perfect: When light passes through the clear, front window of the eye (cornea), it is focused on the inner lining of the eye (retina). Here’s an analogy (Figure 1): think of the cornea as a movie projector, with the retina as a projector screen. The projector and the screen are 20 feet apart, and the projector casts its image 20 feet away onto the screen. The result is a clear image. Consider when the conditions are imperfect: A nearsighted eye is longer, which causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it, leading to a blurry image (Figure 2). Imagine the projector casting an image 20 feet away, but with the projector screen now sitting 25 feet away, which leads to a blurry, out of focus picture.

And so she has a little bit of history about Ortho K and if you could fill us in about it. So I did Ortho K when I was a little bit younger, like when I was 18 and then I did it for a couple of years and I have been using the same lenses for a while and later on I decided to try to switch a lens because my vision has gone a little bit worse. So I wanted to see if there's any chances that I can make my original lens a little bit better. So, and my boyfriend introduced me to Lumen, so that's how I come here. Gotcha. All right. So we're done with our fit now and so what's your vision like? It is perfect. I can see pretty far away. Like it used to have a lot of glares when I wore my older lenses. Now I have less glare and then obviously I can, I can actually look like way better at night because before when I was like trying to like go downstairs, I couldn't really see well and sometimes I even like fall, but now it's like a little bit better. Gotcha. Oh, wonderful. Yeah. I think when it comes to Vivian's lenses, she has a bit more myopia and she has a special type of astigmatism that's more internal. So the lenses have to be able to counter, counteract that astigmatism. That's probably what she had before. And since she had the 100% custom lenses, we were able to mold that out. So as of right now, she has pretty much, she has essentially zero astigmatism residual in both eyes. So what about the fitting process? The fitting process is great. Women really like, really pay attention to a lot of details. When I have any concerns, I would just shoot them a text and they're usually just respond right away. I don't have to like wait a couple of days before I get my answers back. And overall, like on the other hand, scheduling is a little bit more difficult, but obviously any like good practice is going to be like this. And usually they are really punctual. They see you mostly on time. Yeah, yeah. We try. We try. Yeah, I know. Especially during the holidays too, the scheduling gets a little bit, we do get a little bit more booked out. But we try. We like to think even though we're booked out when patients get here, that we give them the full 100%. And so we like to think we're worth waiting for, but hopefully you think that's true.

For the first week, use the artificial tear comfort drops and place one drop in each eye and allow them to settle for 10 seconds. Now take out the given insertion solution and open it. In this case, it's SolaroFill. Next, take out the cleaning case. Unscrew the case, set aside the bottom half, and take out your right lens. After you take the right lens, balance it on the tip of the index finger of your dominant hand. Now take the insertion solution and place two drops into your right lens. Lean forward into the mirror, take a calming breath, and insert the lens gently. Congratulations! You've successfully inserted your Ortho-K lenses. To remove your Ortho-K lenses, use the SolaroFill and place one drop in each eye and blink several times. Now take the small plunger, center it, and apply light pressure to the lens. Rock the lens off your eye. To clean the lens that you just removed, take the cleaning case and remove the top half. Open up the basket for the right lens and insert the lens into the basket. Very carefully, close the case over the basket, making sure not to clip the lens. Repeat with your left lens. Now take the bottom half of the cleaning case and fill it up to the line on the case. Now take the top half of the case and screw it onto the bottom half. Let the case sit for at least 6 hours to disinfect. Note, never place any drops of the red capped bottle directly into your eye.\", 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e_XRLQvjmE', 'Inserting & Removing Your Orthokeratology Lenses', 'Inserting & Removing Your Orthokeratology Lenses']\n",

What do you think about your lenses so far? I like them. Gotcha. So what's it like now when you wake up and the fact that you can see? It's amazing. I'm glad. Okay. Yeah. It's nice to be able to wake up and just see and not have to find your glasses, right? Perfect. Okay. So one thing we keep in mind too is waking up, being able to see is pretty much, it's like a side benefit. It's like a bonus because since Aiden started, his prescriptions been stable with us. And the goal is to keep your prescription low so that your eyes healthier as you get older. Okay. And so we're protecting you there. And then for Tony, what's your experience been like going through the whole process from start to finish? It's been really great. It's been a lot easier than we had anticipated. The initial steps of him getting sized and fitted and everything was really easy. It was painless. Even the initial period when he was getting used to wearing them and putting them in, he struggled the first one to three days. And then after that, we wouldn't even give it a second thought, it was just automatic. We had thought it might be challenging for him to remember to put them on before going to bed and to put them away when he wakes up. But it's just part of his normal routine and I think, and maybe the, I don't even know how long it's been that he's been wearing them now. It's been almost about six months. Six months? Yeah. In that six month period, I think there might've only been one night when he didn't wear them because we got home too late and he was too sleepy to put them in. But aside from that, he's worn them every night and he doesn't seem to have any issues taking them out in the morning. He's transitioned from using the plunger to not using the plunger and he can just take it out without using it. So that's been really easy. We haven't experienced anything adverse. He does a lot of physical activities of biking and bodyboarding and snowboarding season's coming back up again. It's great for him to be able to do all these things without needing glasses or us having to fiddle with getting prescription goggles or anything like that. So it's really, really wonderful. Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. It sounds like, especially since you're so active, it's really been helpful for you. Especially with snowboarding. I hear there's a bunch of snow on the mountain high, so that would be perfect. Or especially when you guys stay at Big Bear, right? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. I feel like it's really, I mean, it's great for the kids. It's really great for the parents to not have to worry about him losing a contact or breaking glasses or forgetting to bring glasses. He's ready to go whenever it's time to do something. Gotcha. Yeah. Especially when it's all under parental supervision. So you know the lens, if something falls out of his eye, it's going to be at home. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well, thank you so much for your input. I really appreciate it.

      "my_row: [182, 1839, \"Hey everybody, it's Dr. Toe here. I just have a quick message to deliver on a great tip that I learned about face masks and glasses fogging up. So if you do wear your glasses throughout the day or even on the computer and you find that they're constantly fogging up, this tip will be perfect for you. So let me show you what to do. So let me hook this one on here first. And so what you need for this tip is a piece of tissue paper. And so I have the tissue, fold it once, fold it twice, fold it three times, and one last fold. And this fold will be essentially the width of your mask, okay? So there we go. And now if you have your face mask, you want to place it right over the nose piece right here. And make sure the nose piece is well contoured for your nose. If you place this on, and there we go. So it reduces the amount of fog coming through. I like to think of it as an accordion sort of gasket to keep the moisture from moving up there. And so hopefully this helps you out. Now one big thing to remind you of though is throughout the day, if you are in contact with anybody where there's any potential COVID in the air, you want to make sure you're not constantly touching your mask. So in the very beginning of the day, if you do this, then that's perfectly fine when you know that your hands are clean and disinfected. But if you're midway through the day, you don't want to take off your mask and futz with it, and then put it back on your face. That's definitely something you don't want to do, okay?

They take on what I call a volcanic shape. Ortho-k lenses work by creating negative pressure, also known as suction, in the region under these humps. The cells then migrate and multiply in this region, ever so slightly thickening the zone. The cornea then takes on the shape of the ortho-k retainer lens. Now here's why ortho-k is special. Let's go back to the picture that we sketched in a previous Why do eyes get worse video. Remember how traditional glasses and contacts over corrected your child's peripheral vision, which led to the accelerated growth of the eye? With ortho-k, there's a unique optical effect that occurs. First, it allows your child to maintain clear vision wherever they're looking. Optically, ortho-k lenses cause the peripheral vision to be focused inside of the eye instead of behind it. Because the peripheral vision is focused inside of the eye, it reduces the stimulus for accelerated growth. And without the stimulus for growth, the eye will retain a smaller shape and your child's eyes will remain healthier for life.\", 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhtuaIazLIw', 'How Ortho-K Works & How It Slows Myopia', 'How Ortho-K Works & How It Slows Myopia']\n",

From there, my vision just basically was getting worse and worse. I got crosslinking done, after crosslinking my vision stayed at one point, but since my vision was, I would say, really bad to the point on my right eye where this is the clarity that I needed, like something had to be this close for my right eye to be able to even see it clearly. It was throwing off my vision compared to my left eye, which is a lot stronger. So, slurl lenses has helped me correct my vision where now I'm able to drive and I'm able to do my work and especially needed being in the tech industry, I need my eyes for that reason alone.

      "my_row: [189, 2467, \"Hey everybody, it's Dr. To from Lumen Optometric and I'm just checking in to make sure that you guys are still doing well, staying healthy out there. And so I'm recording this today just to make sure that we have a little bit more clarity in terms of contact lenses. I've been seeing some news reports that mention that contact lenses aren't healthy to wear during times of the COVID pandemic. And I just want to make sure that everybody knows that there's absolutely no scientific basis, there's no studies that point towards any contact lens wear being unhealthy. And so there's some very specific guidelines to follow to make sure that you're wearing contact lenses in a healthy manner. And so most of these we've gone over with you in training or after you've worn contacts just as a quick touch point. And so one thing is to make sure your eyes washing your hands, okay, so 20 seconds is what we're aiming for here, I'd say a good solid 10 seconds of soaping, 10 seconds of rinsing and drying your hands very well, then and only then should you handle your lenses in the morning. So place them in and the rest of the day, as long as you're not touching your eyes or your face, then you'll be perfectly fine. In terms of disinfection, you have to make sure that you're disinfecting them well too. So most of the times we prefer the peroxide based solution, cleansers, and so usually you'll have a little case and you'll fill it with a solution that has a red cap and after six hours, it'll be completely disinfected. So if you're wearing lenses that you discard every two weeks or every month, or if you're wearing corneal reshaping lenses, you definitely want to make sure you're continuously cleaning your lenses every night or throughout the day, depending on how you wear your lenses. Now for daily disposables, when you do remove them at the end of the day, make sure again, your hands are clean, but you would just discard those lenses, okay? So again, so long as you're keeping your hands clean and you're disinfecting your lenses, there's nothing to worry about in terms of wearing your contact lenses. Again, if you have any questions, give us a call or you can email us or text us on our main line. You can find all that information on our website and hopefully we'll get to see you guys soon. It's been almost about a month that we've closed our doors temporarily. We really miss all of you and so take care and take care of one another, okay?

So let's, let's go, let's go back in time. Tell us about how your eyes work. Okay. So, um, I'm 52 and when I, the last probably five years, my eyes have been getting progressively worse, but it got to the point where I was up to like almost 3.0 readers. And if I was without my glasses, I was literally, I felt blind. It was kind of scary. It was a little bit scary. I felt like it's something really wrong. I didn't know if there was something really wrong with my eyes or I was just getting old. So I booked an appointment here because I didn't have a really an eye doctor that I had been using. I've been sort of self doing my readers. And so that was it. So then I ended up here and that's when I found out about ortho. Okay. I didn't know about it before. So great. So what's your vision like now? It's great. I don't even need glasses at all. So I don't use that. I don't use readers. My distance is fine and it's the greatest thing ever. I feel like I'm about 25 again. Sounds wonderful. Yeah. I still have patients. It's like where it was specifically when it comes to your situation, right? Because you're farsighted. And so for the longest time, I mean, you didn't wear glasses up until pretty recently. Yeah. Yeah. So your distance was always fairly good. And then all of a sudden your reading starts to go and then your distance follows along with that. Yeah. And I didn't even realize my distance was bad until my eye exam. Like I didn't even think I had, I would never have guessed I even had a little distance issue, but this worked out perfect. I've told so many people, my sister wants to do it. She's in Northern California. I'm like, I don't know how you're going to do the fall appointments, but come on down. Sounds like you've been having a great time. What about, yeah. What about your experience here? It was great. I mean, you guys were, I couldn't believe how many, I've never had more eye tests. It was so thorough. It was wonderful. You explained everything. I felt like I was completely understood what I was getting into. And it was well worthy of this. And it was the best thing I've ever done. I thank you for that. I thank you for having my vision again. Because truly I, it's a gift, a gift to have vision again. And you don't realize it until you're losing it and how scary that feeling is. So it's wonderful. I really appreciate it. Well, thank you so much for telling us your story. We're glad to be able to take care of you. You must feel great. It's like giving someone their youth back. I don't know. It's the greatest thing ever. So I hope you all do it. It's wonderful. She jumped right in and she trusted us with her eyes and she's doing really well. So thank you.

      "my_row: [191, 1934, \"Hey everybody, this is Lumen Optometric here, and we have some really exciting news to share with you. We're the first practice in Los Angeles County that's partnered with Treehouse Eyes, which is the national leader in myopia care for kids. And our goal is to provide the latest forms of treatments for myopia for your children to keep their eyes healthy for life. And myopia has been more of an issue. It has to do with all the screen time nowadays, kids have to spend much more time indoors, especially staying at home, staring at their screens as opposed to going to school. There's a lot less time spent outdoors, and all that research points to their eyes worsening. And what we also know now through research is that glasses and standard contacts also worsen myopia as well. And all this is a problem because myopia is unchecked growth of the eye. And so when the eye stretches, all the internal elements aren't meant to stretch that much. So when they're forced to stretch, it leads to greater risks of eye diseases in life, which is not great for their vision. Additionally, it's more difficult to get through life with a very high prescription as opposed to a very small prescription. Now, since we've partnered with Treehouse Eyes, we've been making investments in technology. And the technology allows us to more accurately and quickly monitor your child's myopic progression, so that we can combine research treatments to be able to slow or stop that progression. Now, for more information, you can look down below for our phone number, give us a call, and we'll guide you through it. You can also look on our website under myopia management. There's a lot more information about the specific types of treatments we offer, in addition to the technology that we employ to keep your children's eyes healthy. Now, if we work together, we can keep your children's eyes healthy for life. Okay, hope to see you soon.

And so, what was your life like with previously having a bigger prescription? Previously, I have worn glasses since I was in fourth grade. So about, what is that, eight, nine years old. And it was, you know, part of my life and I never really imagined anything different. I just assumed that's how it would be. I tried contacts for a while and I found that kind of irritating my eye through the day. So I took some time off wearing contacts and just assumed I'd be wearing glasses for the rest of forever. Yeah, and so I remember the day that I had proposed this idea to Ortho-K. You're pretty fired up about it. You're ready to go. Yeah, I was excited. It sounded very innovative and I hadn't heard of it before. So tell us, how's it like now? You've been wearing it for about two and a half weeks. So Lynette's at a pretty stable point. There will be some subtle shifts for her and always in a better direction. But how have your eyes been feeling? Amazing. I'm really excited. I could wake up in the morning and get to see right when I wake up. I'm not fumbling around. I can make my way to the restroom to take off my lenses. Then through the day, it's been awesome. I can see now at night the stars with my own eyes, which I hadn't done since I can't even remember. And that was a really special moment to just get to see clearly without the obstruction of lenses or irritation from my contacts. Yeah, it's funny when we take certain things for granted. But when people have clear vision and they just wake up and they see clear, we take it for granted. We're kind of given that option that it's so different and refreshing.

So before you had the NeuroLens, I mean, how did your eyes feel at work when you were staring at the computer? They got very tired. I had a hard time after a while focusing on, like, spreadsheets, for example. I would get headaches, and honestly, I would avoid some of that close work. Yeah, I know, it's not comfortable, especially when we're on the computer for so many hours a day, or a computer, and we're staring at our phones now, too, and so when we think about the NeuroLens, is there a prescribe specifically just for the computer to wear over your contacts, and how does it feel now? Great! A lot better. I put them on only when I'm working on the computer, and I'm able to work comfortably for a few hours at a time, and I'm not getting the dry eye and the headaches that I had before. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, these symptoms do come, for some patients, they all come together. Patients will have headaches, or dryness specifically is a big one. For some patients, they have dry eye symptoms, but their eyes technically aren't dry when we look for signs of dryness, and so sometimes lenses like NeuroLens can ease those symptoms, too. And they've been really helping you out then, right? They have, yes. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I'm glad. Okay, so thank you for sharing your story with us. You're welcome.

      "my_row: [194, 2942, \"All right, so we have Leslie here, and she's wearing neural lenses, and so can you talk a little bit about what your symptoms were like in the very beginning? Yes. I had really extreme eye fatigue to the point where I couldn't even drive anymore, and I was getting really scared that it was going to be forever. I would have extremely gritty feeling in my eyes. I would have to drive with one eye closed and then switch to the other eye. I would go through bottles of drops in a couple of weeks, and of course headaches and back aches, but really primarily I just felt like my eyes were in total pain, like I had a rubber band wrapped around them, and there was a whole bunch of sand in there. It was very painful. So good news now. It doesn't feel that way anymore, huh? Yeah. It's a huge difference, really huge. I can drive again. I was saying that one of my triggers was being in a dark room with lit screens, which was terrible for work meetings. I would sit in those meetings with my eyes closed, and people would think I was bored or tired. It was very embarrassing. I had to explain it to everybody, but I had a big test where I was at a conference for a whole week like this, and it was pretty great. I could go the whole day at the conference without problems. Yeah, that's wonderful. I mean, being able to do what you need to do without having all that discomfort, it really adds up. You think about the little bits of discomfort throughout the day, and you stretch it out over 8 to 10, 12 hours, and then it really starts adding up. I'm in animal care, and quality of life is something we discuss a lot, and my quality of life was pretty low, because it was on my mind just constantly, constantly bothering me. So, yeah, it's really improved my quality of life. So, you recommend it to family or friends if they have the same type of symptoms? Absolutely. I plan on telling people. I plan on posting about it. Hey, do you have these symptoms? You should see a specialist if you're in the area. So, yeah. I will be singing the praises of these lenses for sure. Yeah, I'm glad they really help you. What about your skepticism? Yeah, I was going to say, I was really skeptical. The thing is, I could see just fine, and for the most part, everything seemed like the glasses I was wearing was suited for what I needed, but I was having some sort of internal problem. In a way, I was, but really, I just didn't understand how lenses could fix that problem. But these are complex lenses, and they're really amazing, and my husband and I both did all the research. We thought it sounded a little cuckoo, but it was our last thing to try. So, really, it's, I am, I believe it now. Yeah. I'm so glad that they're working out for you. It sounds like such a cliche. I know. At the end, it always gets a little tricky. I'm a believer. Yeah. All right.

      "my_row: [196, 4199, \"All right, so we have Natasha here. Natasha is going to help us out with an Ortho-K testimonial. So, tell us about how was your vision before Ortho-K? So, I had pretty moderate astigmatism and myopia. I had LASIK about 13 years ago and thought that I'd have a good long period of time without glasses after that, but unfortunately my astigmatism came back pretty meaningfully. And I tried a lot of different solutions to address it, soft contacts, glasses. I got re-evaluated for TouchUp LASIK, PRK, all kinds of different solutions. And ultimately, the only really comfortable way to address it was through wearing glasses. And after having enjoyed a period of time without glasses after LASIK, I was really looking for another option to go back to being able to go about my day without wearing anything and having kind of easy get up and go routine. And so, after I learned about Ortho-K, I started to research options and that seemed like a good fit for me. Gotcha. So, what's your vision like now? So, after a period of adjustment, it's great. I can see really clearly. I don't need glasses in the morning. I've gotten to a point now where things have settled where I don't even need glasses to read or work during the day. And it's super convenient. I'm really happy with the results. I'm glad. Yeah, the astigmatism is no joke. I mean, you're seeing quite a bit of shadows on things before. A lot of fuzziness, a lot of doubles of things, especially when I read books or when I read things on a computer. And that is like greatly diminished almost to a part where I can't notice it anymore. I know. In the past, when we're looking at the chart there, we're stuck at around 2050, 2070, but now we're really scrutinizing the 2020 line. Exactly, exactly. Yes, I'm super happy about that. Very excited. I'm glad. So, how about your experience? Did you feel as if we took good care of you? Yeah, yeah. I think for me, it was really important to find a place where, you know, you were using like the latest technology, using all the right tools. I think the process that we went through, there were a lot. I felt really good about the quality in terms of both the service and then also the equipment that you're using to get measurements. And then when I got the lenses that also felt really high quality and we've been able to adjust the lenses over time through all the customization that you do to get to a really good fit. And so, you know, for something that I heard by reputation wasn't super comfortable to wear, they're actually pretty comfortable. You know, I don't really notice it when I go to sleep at night. And so, it's all around been a really good experience. I'm glad. And the team is great. Really nice. Everyone's really helpful and the service is really great. Hey, Natasha is really easy to work with. She's super mellow and easygoing. So, thank you so much for telling your story and we appreciate your time. I'm kind of surprised that not more people know about OrthoK actually. I think people have an impression that it's more for younger kids, which is actually how I knew about it in the first place. But having this as an option, not having to do LASIK and deal with all the potential complications, if I had known that this was an option years ago, I probably would have done this instead. Yeah, but a lot of times practitioners who do fit it don't always bring it up for adults because adults are a lot more discerning. Right. So, it does usually take more effort when it comes to adults. Interesting. But I like fine-tuning. I mean, it makes it happy. Definitely, it's more vision-changing, life-changing. Yeah, and having the option to change it over time as my vision changes would have been a meaningful thing to understand about LASIK. They kind of warn you about that, but the way that they position it is when you get old enough to have to use reading glasses, that's when you will go back to glasses. They don't talk about astigmatism coming back, right? And that's, I think, I gather more common than, you know, I understood. So, if I had known that, I probably would have more seriously considered this. All right. Well, thank you so much. For sure.

So how's your day going? Good. Good? All right. Yeah, so in terms of your vision, I mean, you were diagnosed with keratoconus, and so I think when I first saw you, do you remember some of your initial complaints? Yeah, I had a lot of glare wearing my glasses. I had, I couldn't necessarily see, even with like a new updated prescription, I couldn't see very clearly, very long distance, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I remember when we tried glasses on you initially, and the glasses, there was sort of a limit to your vision, and it's because the cornea is distorted when it comes to keratoconus, so having the scleral lens effectively gives you a new surface to work from. So how's your vision now? My vision is better. It's improved. I can see more clearly. The details of what I can see now, it's just, I mean, they're magnified. I mean, they're just, it's impressive how much I can see, which, yeah, I never knew you could see that many details. Yeah. I think, yeah, you were talking about even being able to see dry skin on your kid's teeth. Dry skin patches, I can see very tiny hair follicles on people's faces. Yeah. That's the interesting part. Yeah. Yeah. I can see a lot of details. Yeah, positives and negatives there. So I think in terms of glare, I did cut down some glare. I think erasing all the glare is still a difficult task, but I think, would you say it's still substantially reduced and more comfortable to drive now? It is, yeah. It is very comfortable to drive, especially during daytime. I, um, it's just, um, yeah, it's like distance wise, I can see better. Um, the, yeah, the glare part, I, it doesn't, I notice it obviously in the evening, but it doesn't bother me as much. Yeah. That's the part that has really improved. And then how about comfort with your lenses on? I, I don't feel them. So, um, perhaps I've gotten used to it, but I, years ago I had tried, um, uh, soft lenses I guess, contacts, and it felt like there was sand in my eyes. I mean, it was just like really uncomfortable. I couldn't get used to them. And these, I don't feel these, I, I can wear them for 12 hours. And, um, there was a day where I wore them longer than 12 hours and it was still comfortable. You know, see, well, I was working on the computer and it was just really, everything was really intact. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. And when it comes to these, I mean, you, since you're familiar with how you fill them up are, uh, the listeners might not be, but you basically fill it with solution and then you place it in the eye. So it's holding solution up against your eye all day long. Whereas soft contacts, if you take it out of your eye and you put it on the table, it basically turns into a potato chip about a minute later. Where these hold their structure and they don't require your tears in order to stay hydrated. Yeah. No, and I do. And I feel that I feel the hydration with the solution. It feels, yeah, I do feel it. That's like a damn cool feeling. It's like air conditioning for your eyes without the dryness. Yeah. That's how it feels. Yeah. So overall, it sounds like you're happy with this. Yes. It's perfect. And I wasn't sure I was going to be, and in the beginning it was challenging to put them on, but that lasted only, I don't know, maybe a week and I became more comfortable with it. Yeah.

This is what is required to see clearly. For our young patients that become myopic, which leads to nearsightedness, their eyes elongate and the world now falls out of focus. Glasses or contacts are traditionally used to correct this blur. But, as myopic parents know, the first pair of glasses or contacts is never the last. When a child wears traditional glasses or contacts, it corrects their central vision. But it wasn't until recently that we learned two new things. First, we learned that traditional glasses and contacts overcorrect their peripheral vision. Second, we learned that the brain pays more attention to the peripheral vision to regulate how the eye grows. Since the brain is watching this region, it grows the eye to land itself back on the plane of clear vision.

When we met Sean, Sean was about a foot shorter and now he's grown so much but his prescription back in the day was was really large I mean it was minus I believe it was minus eight minus two so it was quite a significant prescription and so nowadays his prescription hasn't changed and it's been very very stable and so I mean afterwards well do you remember your first night waking up what it was like? From the first night I was very excited that my vision will eventually get better because that was my dream of like I always wanted to see 2020 and just I feel very excited for it it was unbelievable I was thinking when I was younger I always like thought like something to help me with this vision now that we have the solution I was glad I was grateful. It's rewarding to see that that you enjoyed it so much yeah and so what about the fitting process and what did you think about the whole fitting process for Sean? Well when we started talking and you recommended this process I believe that it went very smoothly obviously there's a lot of benefits to it because in addition to his vision also the health concerns about his vision just getting worse over time so but the fitting process went very slowly it went very well you're you're you always answered all our questions so we really appreciate that I think it went great and it's still going great so we're very happy with that I'm glad yeah it's when you when you join our program you guys are almost like family you know you text me whenever yeah absolutely we we definitely appreciate all the all the feedback too we all the questions we have are answered and I think him having something not to worry about all the time during the day is much better because he puts them on at night takes them off in the morning I think it's a much smoother process for him and of course his vision his health those are very important things for us so yeah and so we're monitoring we'll make sure everything's healthy you know we just today we took your axial length and we have the stable measurements there and we'll just monitor your ear to make sure you're not changing yeah so any any any tips for for parents who are watching this video I would recommend it it's I mean it's better overall you can overall help you with your vision and then you don't have to worry about any of the risks like having 2020 for like the entire day and having it will just benefit you overall your vision yeah that's a great recommendation all right thank you two really appreciate it\", 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk96_v9_6qs', \"I Wake Up & See!

In the past I would have to wear glasses and it wouldn't be really easy to see so I would have to squint a lot and I always had to change glasses because my eyes would always get worse each year. Yeah your prescription was pretty high do you mind if I share his prescription? Yeah so Aiden's prescription it's around approximately minus six minus four diopters so he has a lot of astigmatism he has more astigmatism than most people have myopia so quite significant and so definitely needed your glasses in order to see right? Yes. Yeah so how's your vision now after wearing Ortho K? Much better. Yeah I'm glad it's neat being able to wake up and see clear yeah? Yes. Perfect perfect okay and you don't have to deal with foggy glasses or anything like that? No. Oh I see yeah so the nicest part waking up and just not having to find your glasses it's like you don't have to put on your eyes in the morning. Yes much easier. I'm glad I'm glad and then from Patty's perspective as a parent I mean did you feel as if we we educated through the whole process that all the gaps were filled and that Aiden was in good control? Right yes from the very beginning when we came in for our initial visit you explained things more than anybody else we we actually went to a lot of different offices but you actually explained the process of Ortho K even though we read a lot before the way you explained it explained gave a lot of more information and it was good that he listened to it and heard it as well from you versus just from his mom and the whole process you work you walk us through you're always available for questions I didn't expect you to respond so quickly like to some of my late texts everyday too but you're always available for our questions so we appreciate that. Thank you yeah we work as a team so we always try to involve our patients because if Aiden's on board then we're ready to rock and roll if he's not on board then we've got some talking to do. I remember we came almost every week for the for the training with the eye so I appreciate your staff's patience they're always upbeat and they're always patient with him and us even though we came week after week and that was like second nature to him but in the beginning it was really tough. Yeah you learn so fast though I mean in the beginning you think about that one instrument that scans your eye you didn't even let us get close to your eye with that instrument so you think of where you started and where you are now and the strides that you made it's really mind-blowing you really went really far really fast so he's had to kind of teach you the ropes and then you pulled yourself up and you now you're doing great so yeah so thank you so much for your testimonial and really appreciate the the dedication you know the Heidi's really on it she's one of those moms where we know that she's every aspect of it she's got it under control and she's taking really good care so she's actually one of our our favorite mom patients that comes in to take care of this because we know she loves her kids so much you can tell um and I wish I had been sooner I just wish I'd been sooner. That's okay the information out there is a little tough to find truthfully because unless you stumble upon myopia management or or the words ortho k it's not as well known as as like let's say orthodontia and so but but yeah it's getting more traction and and the results are there for themselves again Aiden's happy with his vision he's got a huge honking prescription so so thank you so much.

      "my_row: [204, 14704, \"Hey everybody, it's Eric To from Lumen Optometric, and today I wanted to share with you my tutorial for converting this Honeywell HPA 300 HEPA filter to create a negative pressure environment in your exam rooms. And the reason why I decided to find a way to do this, there weren't any current guides and there's very little talk about negative pressure rooms for private practitioners like ourselves. But, I mean, with the case numbers going up everywhere, and I mean, at Lumen we really employ all the different techniques to keep things healthy. I mean, we disinfect everything, patients are screened at the door, everything is scheduled online, filled in online in terms of our exams. They're even broken up into separate rooms where I interview patients from a separate room from the exam environment, so that room can purify with HEPA filtration. But to me, given the numbers and the state of where we currently are, I don't think it's enough. So hopefully if you find this tutorial helpful, it'll keep your staff and it'll keep yourself and your patients a little healthier. So first, to start, you need the Honeywell HPA 300. This is fairly oversized for a typical exam room. My exam rooms are a little over 80 square feet, so if you're anywhere from 80 to 100, I'm fairly certain that when you kick it into turbo mode, and once you account for all the different leaks in your room, that you should be able to hit the recommended negative 0.01 inches water column. With this one, we definitely hit it in our room. So if your rooms are about the same size, you should be fine there too. So get the unit, make sure it's unplugged. Actually, before you do any of this, make sure it works first. So plug it in, fire it up, and then unplug it. And so what you'll need is a Torx screw set. And so this bit right here is a Torx 15, but it is the security version. So in the very center, there'll be a little divot, and that'll be necessary so that you can actually loosen the screws that were not really intended to be loosened. And so there's six of them. There's one, two, three, which is mirrored on the other side. So some of them are a little tight initially. So good luck on taking those out, and we'll pause for a second, and we'll move to the next step after. Okay, so all the screws are undone at this point, and this is where our goal is to take this thing apart without breaking clips. Luckily, it's not too bad. And once you take all those off, then you can start to pull the bottom half away from the rest of the unit, and all the clips are on the top, this top ring here, and it inserts into this plastic piece here. So as you pull away, if you pull downward, and you sort of push on this area here, too, you can actually see some of the clips. There we go. Even if you break the clips, it's not a huge deal, and it all gets tucked underneath there. But what is important to take out, I'll show you in a second. There we go. It's these little wings on the edge here. You'll be able to see them. Okay, so you pull this thing away, and do be careful. Depending on the surface, this can tip forward. Okay, so this piece you won't need for a while, so you can set it aside. And that's the internals here. So that's the fan. The rest of it, basically, the next step is, there's screws in this area. So these are just two Phillips screw heads. So just remove both of these. Okay, so we'll pause here as well. With those two Phillips head removed, then you can take this top panel off. This one will always stay connected because of the cables here. Mine obviously looks a little different because this was the first version that I had built out just to mess with. And so when you had just one exhaust duct like I had first built it out, I couldn't hit the .01 because there was just too much of an obstruction to airflow. And let's see. So you pop it off pretty much the exact same way. So you've got the little clips that you have to be careful about. Okay, so this goes to the front piece here. And basically what I was doing most of the time in terms of the front piece was just to support it. Usually if I'm doing this at home, it'll tip over if it's on a carpet, but here it's fine. Okay, so now we're getting a closer look at the top grill here. And so you notice this area is cut out. And so this is where the first exhaust vent pulls through here. And so you just have to take a Dremel and cut really nicely through all this one. The tricky part is you have this one card sleeve that's built into the HPA300. Once you have it, you'll see it. And there's a little Phillips head screw. You have to unscrew that so that you can pull out the plastic cards. Otherwise, you still do need to Dremel off this piece. So this is actually going to be my revision 2.0 since I'm adding two exhaust vents instead of one. So what you'll want to do is with your Dremel to continue cutting this whole section off too. So this whole area will be just as bare as this area. It'll be essentially almost mirrored there as well. So get out your Dremel, put on your safety goggles, and watch out for your hands. Put on gloves if you need and cut that whole part out. Since I'm disassembling this one, you'll get a chance to see exactly sort of what the near-end product looks like here. So you have this top cover, this white cover here right next to that surrounds the whole pipe. And that keeps the unit from venting out or exhausting from anywhere other than that vent pipe. And so all that yellow sort of dough looking stuff is actually just gap filler. And so in a few moments, I'll show you what that looks like. All these things were purchased at Home Depot. I mean, the downspout is essentially a rain gutter. Found those from Home Depot too. You usually find that all the way in the back with the raw materials. Fairly, usually an aisle or two away from that is where you find the gap filler as well. So since we're working backwards, let me pop this out here. So here's a close-up of what it looks like on the inside of this vent here. So you can see this vent is basically, in terms of the exhaust, that's the end of the road in terms of how the air would flow. The normal unit, the air exhausts up all the way through this whole space. All the way through here is one whole exhaust vent. So basically, the way that I've set this up here is that this is as far as it goes before venting. And so it wasn't enough. So basically, that's what I've cut out this extra hole for. That's for the secondary version of this to sit in here. So what I'll have to do in a second is I'll show you exactly how I've cut these pipes in order for them to work. This is kind of an overview for you to understand how it works out. Once you kind of get an idea of how it's set up, then you actually can sort of wing it. Anyway, so the expanding foam fills in all the gaps so that the air can't escape past this vent right here. And it's the same on that side too. One of the reasons why I took this thing off is it's actually glued down a little. It's pretty tight. And so that's how that part works. I have the template for this top piece. All you have to do is print it out, tape them together, overlay it on some foam core board, which is what I have here. You'll still have to test fit it. There's a little bit of variance with these units. I found even between my two units. Cut out the holes, and then you'll have to cut out the downspouts You do want to take some preliminary measurements before you start to cut here. This is the first piece that you do want to cut out. This one I would cut out to be around 7 inches. No more than 8 inches. There's a little bit of flexibility, but the problem is once you start getting really tall, this piece, since it's connected and you've cut a hole into it, you won't be able to pull it over too long of a tube. If you keep it to about 7 to 7.5 inches, you'll have enough space here. Cut that 7.5 inch piece of downspout first. In terms of how you want that shape to be cut out, this one I couldn't pull out. It's already glued in there. For the most part, you want it to be open-faced. You'll basically cut that and that's what you can see that I've done essentially here. In terms of the height of that, for me it's about 3.25 inches. You'll know exactly what yours will be because once you cut out these holes from the template and you stick your 7.5 inch piece through that hole and you drop the foam down as far as it'll go for you, then you want to measure from the very front of it, not from the bottom of the filter though because that whole bottom section of the filter here, if you can use an imaginary line, it's sort of curved. If you measure from the bottom, it's not necessarily where the lowest point of that pipe is going to be. The lowest point is actually going to be sitting somewhere here. You could be real fancy and cut it angled if you want, but it really doesn't matter. It's going to be supported only at this point so you do want to measure from the bottom of the pipe, not from the top of the filter. Measure from the bottom of the pipe going on up to this point. For me, you definitely don't want to cut higher than 3.25. The measurement you're looking at is 3.25 for the back piece. In terms of the front piece, it'll be higher than 3.25 because again, that part sort of there's a decline to it. You just stick the other pipe in there and basically what I did was I had the other pipe, which was a whole pipe, stuck it all the way in and then you just this one will actually have to sit about maybe 3-4mm in front of the other one just so that the ridges line up with one another. Set it in so it's comfortable and that it's resting on the decline portion here so it's not going anywhere. That's where it's steady and then draw the line and make sure you cut underneath that line so that you still ensure that seal around here. If these aren't even, it's really not a big deal. You don't have to be very exact because you still have other pipes that are going to sit on top of it later. You'll get your cut length on this one. This one for me was probably around 3.75mm but again, measure yours first. Basically you're just cutting out little stilts just to hold it in place so the air can pass through it but doesn't impede the flow to the pipe that you had already placed in there the first time. This is what I used, the big gap filler this is from Home Depot as well and so you screw on the pipe up there If you have a couple of rooms that you want to do it's advisable to work your way up to this point first because this big gap filler if you let it sit for too long it hardens and usually doesn't allow use over multiple times because everything just dries up here. At this point you've inserted everything in and you have the pipe inserted as well just the back pipe is what we'll start off with and then what you want to do is basically fill exactly where I had filled before. This comes out pretty fast and expands quite a bit so you don't have to lay down too much so fill this gap here that gap back there should be filled too and then fill up this whole gap and that gap down there and once you have that in place you can slide your other piece here and insert it in there and at that point push it down a little bit and you can actually seal off the outer edges there too and you might as well seal off the rest of the edges here too that way it ensures a complete seal Alright so everything is placed in there and it's secured and it's sealed off one thing you can also do is to cut out a second a second cover up sheet from that template so ideally if you had it in black it would be great I had paper lying around so I had a heavier paper stock of white so I cut it out and you just lay it over it doesn't have to sit completely flat for the most part because when you put the grow back on it will obscure the vast majority of all this you just want to cover up some of the ugly cut marks that you had made or if you were neater it might look cleaner than mine but it's not visible from the patient's perspective and we have cut the larger hole by now and you insert it right back over it's going to be a little snug and just make sure everything clips back into place especially these have to definitely go in first so make sure it's almost like a finger in order to to lock in properly there just push it on down and then you just place the front plate back on and screw in those six screws actually before you do the six screws make sure you have the two phillips here and then screw in the six now for reassembly again it's critical to make sure these little nibs go in first so you have the piece of plastic on the inside of the unit and this little wing here it's like a little fork so it does have to insert before the rest of it allows you to click it in place so it's all clipped in there same on the other side then insert all the screws and you're pretty much done with this part at least one other thing that has to be done as well is that the return vents in the rooms have to be closed off so you do have to cover them off otherwise the negative pressure system will just draw air from the return vents so seal them off just like I did for the ceiling tile here and here's the final piece here and so you do have two separate downspouts that sit on top of the ones that we were modifying here and each pipe is individually wrapped with that aluminum duct tape and then I just had one more wrapped around both of them just for aesthetic purposes so you can see they both exhaust up through the ceiling tiles here into the interstitial space and at this point the room is fairly sealed from the interstitial space and you should seal up any other ports behind the walls for me I have video cables running through the walls so all those ports are sealed up so you don't get any air leakage otherwise I think this will keep you as healthy as possible ideally you do want to set this up somewhere between the door and this vent but for most of us optometrists usually right behind the patient is some sort of visual acuity mirror so it doesn't quite work out that way plus the patient has to recline so for me off and to the side worked out a little better so if they're always in constant air flow in the path of air flow then it would work better now verify the negative pressure with a digital pressure gauge or analog it should read negative .01 inches water column do note my tubes are reversed so the reading is positive so good luck and if you have any questions post them down in the comments below and if you find this helpful at all for you then please subscribe and like the video too Thank you for watching\", 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV_lqzoUekI', \"Negative Pressure Tutorial for Doctor's Offices\", \"Negative Pressure Tutorial for Doctor's Offices\"]\n",

It's about time to come out of hibernation and we've developed some COVID-19 protocols to make sure that we're being as safe and as healthy as possible for all of the Sierra Madre residents on the surrounding cities. And so I'd like to share some of those ideas with you today. Now those protocols will start even before you come into the office. And so we always have online scheduling that we can assist you with that through text message, emails, phone calls, and we also have required online forms. So when you fill out your forms online, it allows us to spend more direct time with you throughout the whole exam. When you get to the office, we can jump right into the exam instead of waiting for paperwork to be filled out. And three, it minimizes touch points. Now when you get into the office, there's a few things we have to do before you're allowed entry. And the first is that we'll have a COVID questionnaire to make sure that you're feeling healthy and others around you are also still feeling healthy at home. And two, we'll take your temperature with a non-contact thermometer. And three, we'll ensure that you're wearing a mask and we'll also provide hand sanitizer so when you come in, your hands are perfectly clean too. And at that point, we'll jump right into the exam, but the exam does split into two parts. The first part is the case history. Normally I'd spend face-to-face time with a patient during that time, but since we're trying to minimize face-to-face time, that'll be in a different room and it'll be done through a web communication. So I'll be able to see your face, you'll be able to see mine. We'll just talk remotely. And then the second part of the exam resumes as normal. We move into a different room, so we have fresh air. And in that room is when I walk in and I'll check your eyes, I'll make sure you're seeing clearly, wrap up any other concerns, and then our opticians will take you out to the front if you need glasses. And there, they have face shields and they'll be masked as well and all of our instruments have shields built into them to protect my employees and yourself. If you need contacts, everything will just be shipped to you directly. And after you leave, we'll spend about 10 to 15 minutes at disinfect everything. It gives us ample time to clean things and also gives ample time for any aerosolized viral particles to settle. We hope that there won't be any viral particles, but just in case we will have the time for them to settle and the air will be cleaned. We're going to utilize chemical disinfection, UVC, ozone, and have the filtration as well. So we're doing the best that we can to keep everyone safe and healthy. Now, if you have any other suggestions, please share them with us. We're glad to take them in and to integrate them into our systems. And I hope to see you guys really soon. And until then, take care.\", 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6VgVfYl9R0', 'Our Plan To Keep You Healthy During COVID-19', 'Our Plan To Keep You Healthy During COVID-19']\n",

      "my_row: [209, 10043, \"Hey guys! So good morning. Buenos dias. So we woke up early-ish to come back to Isaac's eye doctor because he has another appointment. And if you guys remember we talked about how Isaac has these CRT lenses that are kind of like retainers for your eyeballs so he doesn't have to wear any sort of like eye correctiveness throughout the day. So no contacts, no glasses. And a lot of you guys were actually curious and wanted to learn more about what CRT lenses are because like me in the past, you guys have never heard about these lenses. So we're actually going to be talking to Isaac's eye doctor about them and learning more about what CRT lenses are all about. And also hear from Isaac and see what his experience with them have been. He's still waking up so excuse Isaac for a little bit. You still have your bed head going on. Yeah. Hi doctor! Hello, hey Isaac. How are you? You ready to get those lenses checked? Yeah. Yeah. Alright so this is Dr. Eric Toh here at Lumen Optometric and he's going to be talking to us about this boy's lenses right here. Did it bring out? Yep. Nice. Alright so we got the lenses and we're going to get educated. So this is optically how corneal reshaping or ortho-K lenses work compared to standard lenses. So when we focus here and when I draw this shape, think of this as the cornea. This is the clear window of your eye looking straight up towards the ceiling here. And so when you wear, let's say normal contacts, normal contacts just drape over the eye. They're soft and there's really no, they just conform to the eye essentially. Now when it's corneal reshaping or ortho-K lenses, the lenses have a more unique shape. And so I call it a volcanic shape here. And so you'll see these two humps in this specific area. And so when you sleep in this lens, what happens is that there's a force, there's a negative pressure force. So it's actually a pull force. So it pulls in this direction and it pulls in this direction here. There's no pushing. When you have a lens that pushes, it's unhealthy and some patients do have issues, which we'll talk about later. But when you have a properly designed lens, it's always negative pressure. There's never any push. And so what happens, what's unique about how this works is that in terms of the cornea, the cells will actually migrate to the area of pull and they'll migrate to this area and they'll migrate to this region as well. And then what happens is, is that there's a resultant change in the shape of the cornea. So the cornea actually takes on this slightly volcanic shape as well. So it's a little bit thicker in this region and it's a little bit thicker in this region. And for all of the patients, like for Isaac too, Isaac was myopic, otherwise known as nearsighted. And if any of you folks watching the video are myopic or nearsighted, if you touch your lenses, your glasses lenses, you'll notice it's thicker at the edges compared to the center. And so the way we always designate lenses for patients who are myopic is, it looks like this. It's sort of like a sideways hourglass. But you can tell it's thicker on the edge here and thicker here. And optically, that's how it cancels out the prescription. So essentially what we're doing is we're building that correction into the eye. That's what allows Isaac to see clear every morning once he takes the lenses out and he sees clear for the rest of the day. Yeah. So I actually had a DM from one of you guys asking me whether or not Dr. Toe has discussed with us the negative side effects that could potentially happen. Because there was someone in my DMs who told me about her experience, how she had CRT lenses growing up throughout her childhood. But then when she entered her adulthood, she was notified that those lenses ended up like eating down her cornea. So she ended up having a negative experience with CRT lenses. So what are some thoughts that you might have as to why that might have happened to her? And is this an actual effect that can happen to anyone? Like to Isaac, for example? Like will we find out later when he's an adult that his cornea is depleted? When it comes to this question, it goes back to how you design the lenses with the software and also how you monitor your patients as well. So if we go back to a really quick whiteboard, when you consider how the lenses are shaped again, right? So really exaggerated here. Again, you're creating negative pressure here and negative pressure here. And the cornea pretty much sits right underneath it. The thing is, is that these lenses, there's always a cushion of tears. Okay, there's never a point where the lens or there's never a point where the lens is supposed to actually touch the eye. Because if the back surface of that lens touches the front surface of your cornea, you'll definitely have an abrasion. And so most likely that's probably what happened. For some of our patients, we always, or for all of our patients, we always monitor how their eyes are doing by looking in. And I have Isaac come back quarterly to make sure everything's healthy. I think even for Tiffany, she didn't, she wasn't aware of OrthoK CRT until somebody else had told her about it. And so a lot of patients aren't aware of it. And there's a lot of potential for keeping eyes healthy with it. I mean, this isn't the only way to keep eyes healthy. Whenever we have a patient, we always fight to make sure that they're healthy and that they love the experience because most parents don't know. And so when somebody performs OrthoK improperly, then that type of news spreads. And it does, it does kids, kids like Isaac a disservice. It does future kids whose parents who find that one, I mean, for every thousand kids who are happy, there might be one child who saw a provider that wasn't taking very good care. And, and the news of that one tends to spread like wildfire. Yeah. And so, um, I always fight to make sure our kids are, are taking, have their eyes well taken care of so that their, their eyes are healthy and that future kids don't, don't find this, this, this news and their parents don't tend to ruminate on it. Yeah, that's true. Because we actually heard from Isaac's dentist about his daughter doing CRT lenses. And we were like, what is this? Cause Isaac had already been tired of using contact or no, not contacts. He had been tired of using glasses. He was interested in getting contacts. But then once his dentist brought this up, we were like, Oh, that sounds way better. You have to wear contacts throughout the days, only at night. We started treatment back in April. So it's already been more than a whole year that you've been doing this. Honestly, it feels nice. I remember when I was little and I had clear vision. I remember one day I looked into the projector at school. And that's when it started getting blurry. It's pretty nice to have that same experience, but older and getting to see a road name from far away without wearing anything on my face. Yeah. But like when you were really little and you had clear vision, huh? Yeah. So it's really nice. The lenses I have now is very comfortable. That you have now, the lenses that you have now are very comfortable. Because I can't really feel them sometimes. So yeah, it's like my regular eye. I know in the beginning when we first started this treatment, you were having some issues with the comfortableness, comfortability of your lenses. Yeah, comfort. Yeah. Yeah, I think for Isaac, I mean, you were seeing clear even though it was a little uncomfortable in the beginning, though, from what I recall. And so optically, he was well protected. But some of our patients, their eyes are a little more sensitive. So I just have to alter the fit. I mean, when you're taking a custom scan, you're taking a custom scan of essentially, it's a soft, soft tissue. Yeah. And so there's assumptions that are made there. And for some patients, the assumptions are really spot on. Sometimes they're a little bit more off, they're a little off. And so we just have to accommodate for it. And so once once we're aware of the issue, then we correct it. And now we're good. Yeah. And another thing that really sold me for CRT lenses was when we first came in, Dr. To is telling us about how over time, that these types of lenses end up maintaining the health of Isaac's eyeballs over time, your eyes end up getting elongated, because those lenses are over correcting your eyes. So which means like, throughout time, your vision is technically getting worse, right? Normally, yeah, normally, normally, if we hadn't done anything, and if Isaac were just continue with normal glasses or contacts, his eyes would have kept growing. Yeah. And every time it's it grows, it actually gets less healthy. Yeah, because the there's the there's a light, think of the eye as a camera, there's essentially, it's almost like film on the inside, it's the retina. And that is the same size as your eyes growing. The problem is, as your eye grows, that retina has to stretch. And so it doesn't like being stretched. Alright, so we got to learn a lot from Dr. To about CRT lenses, and myopia management. And if you guys are interested in checking out Dr. To, you can check out the website down in the description below lumenoptometric.com. And if you're not local to LA, you can also check out his website. And then there's also references or resources there where you guys can find an eye doctor closest to you. So thank you so much, Dr. To for having us appreciate the educational lesson. And we'll be coming back for Isaac's checkups. All right, now we're gonna go home and play some video games. Yeah, right. Spend some time outside, right? Rest those eyes. We'll ride on my ripstick. Yeah, we'll ride on his ripstick. He tried teaching me the other day and it was a fail. But you can try teaching me again. Yeah. Maybe. I could ride to the mailbox. Yes. Yeah, away from video games, right? That's right. Yeah, yeah. More time outside, less time indoors.

So I just forget my glasses and then I can't see for class No, so it's great being able to just wake up and go about my day And then what about the benefits or what can you do now that you couldn't do before or was more difficult for you to do Before it was definitely more difficult for me to play sports, you know wearing glasses while playing volleyball is not ideal I think it's smacked in the face So it was very nice to not have to worry about that for studying and worry about headaches wearing glasses Staring at my computer for however long baking even so my glasses don't fall into the batter. That's great Yeah Yeah, that's wonderful You think about the the other benefit to the one of the really important benefits is the the fact that your prescription hasn't changed much since we've met and It's stable your eyes in a much healthier place So for for our parents or for our other potential young patients who are thinking about CRT What do you think thumbs up or thumbs down?

She's been willing to help us out with this video testimonial of her SLARO lenses. So Cindy, when you first came in, what was going on with your current contacts and your issues that you're experiencing? Well, I had ongoing issues with my rigid cast permeable lenses, fogging up, just not clear, needing to take them out several times a day to clean them, to try to see better and I thought, gee, got to do something about this. So I called up the practice and was told that I probably would be a good candidate to look into the SLARO lenses and so I did. Oh, that's great. I remember when you first came in, you had mentioned that you were cleaning them, I think you had almost mentioned once every like 15, 20 minutes or something like that. Yes. Yeah. So it was impacting my lifestyle. I mean, I was nervous to go out because I was always afraid the lenses would fog up while I was driving and having to carry cleaning solution, take them out of public restrooms, clean them, all of that. So, yeah. Super, super comfortable. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So at this point, Cindy's wearing the S-MAP created lenses and so the S-MAP creates a custom scan of the whole frontal aspect of the eye and we create a SLARO lens off of that and I coin these as SLARO 2.0 lenses. So how do they feel? They feel wonderful. I don't even realize they're on my eye. Very, very comfortable. Yeah. It's good to know. And then your prescription is extremely high, so what would you say in terms of stability of your vision? Does it fluctuate like it did with gas permeable lenses? Oh, very stable. So much better. Just put them in in the morning and they stay in all day. Last thing to come out at night and it's been fabulous. Just to kind of get my life back to know I could see clearly all day. All right.

Before Ortho-K, I used regular soft-faced lenses or just daily lenses that I used to wear. They were extremely dry. I used to just have different eyedrops with me no matter where I went. Whether I was working long shifts at my work or if I was in a room where the fan or the air conditioning was on me, they would constantly dry out to the point where I was blinking and they would just fall out. So, eyedrops were essential and it just became tedious and it just became uncomfortable. So, coming here and finding a whole new, brand new type of solution was extremely nice. And I'm extremely grateful for Dr. To and everything that he's done for me. So, before, do not recommend this new method. I highly recommend and I'm so happy that I made the change. Glad. Yeah, I know with dry eyes, it's definitely not comfortable, especially when it comes to soft contacts. So, what's your vision like now? My vision now is absolutely amazing. I'm really obsessed with it and extremely grateful for everything that the doctor and this business has done for me and that these new contacts have done for me. My vision now, I feel like I'm looking in HD. I'm viewing in 4K. I don't have any blurriness. I wear them for one night when I wake up and I can see everything. I'm usually nearsighted. So, like before I had problems seeing faces far away, reading signs far away. So, driving is fantastic now, like recognizing faces and seeing people, going to work, being able to view and see everything in clear, perfect vision is so nice and I really love it. Yeah, it was exciting for you, especially that day when you came in for the dispense and we placed it in your eye and then by the time we took it off, it wasn't even on for that long. Yes, yeah. When we tried on the lens, we did a couple of tests for like a couple of minutes and then I took them off and I only put them on for like 10 minutes and I was able to see it already. I was so excited to be able to sleep in them and then be able to live my life and live my entire day after all of that. So, very seamless process and yeah, dry eyes are not a problem anymore. I don't have to carry on my liquid eye drops or anything. So, very happy and I just feel like a normal person that can wake up and start my day and not have to worry about one more thing that I have to do. That's wonderful. How about the whole process? Do you feel like we held your hand through the whole thing, that we taught you everything you needed to know? Yeah, coming into this office, a couple of things like setting an appointment is extremely easy. Coming in, they make time for each individual patient. So, when you're here, their full attention is on you. You don't have to wait in a waiting room for 15, 20, 30 minutes. When it's your appointment time, they make that time just for you because they space them out. They give you their full attention. They're really good with doing recurrent and bringing you back every couple of weeks, every two weeks, checking in on you. Additionally, Dr. To will always text you and ask you how you're doing. He'll send you emails regularly. He's very hands-on, makes you very comfortable and really great experience here. I'm really glad that I found this place. Thank you so much. You're welcome.

I would tear up quite often, very itchy, and I was constantly conscious that I needed to rub them because they were either too dry or itchy. And then also, in terms of how your head felt, do you remember where most of your headaches would occur? Yes, I would get headaches several times during the week, starting from the temple and sometimes going to the back of my neck. So you're definitely on the computer quite a bit, huh? Yes, from very early hours in the morning at work and then still come home and be on my computer to take care of things at home too. I know what that feels like. That's very painful all day long.

And so, two years later, here we are. Yeah. So, do you remember the very first night when you woke up after having slept in the lenses? What was your vision like? Yeah.

Yeah, before my vision was super, super bad, especially growing up with astigmatism. It was always a challenge and I've always had glasses since I can remember. So now it's a very new experience, but it's a good progression that I'm excited to see, that I can just see in general, and that I don't have to use glasses no longer. Yeah, it's nice though. I know a lot of folks who have clear vision sort of take it for granted, but I mean, both of you have fairly high prescription. So going from so blurry, being able now to see 20-20 is a pretty big difference when you wake up, right? You don't have to retrace your glasses anymore. Yeah, yeah. So I'm glad. Perfect. And then what I'd like to ask the parents too, from your perspective, do you feel as if we took good care of your children to make sure that they were seen clear and their eyes were healthy? Definitely. It was very exciting for me to know about the way how they can progress their vision. And once we started with my son and then later on with Sahara, I can see in both of them the progress and the hassle not to be looking for glasses and spending so much in frames and all this stuff. So it is a very, very good system in how to correct the vision. It's very exciting to see how this fast they were able to get rid of the glasses. Yeah, that's great. And then any tips for any future parents looking into myopia management? I will say they should search for this option instead of having the glasses, especially when the kids are very active, like Hector, he was very active. It was very a hassle to see how to help him not to fall with his glasses on and stuff like that. So I will say I would recommend to the parents definitely to go by this option. It's way better than the lenses. Yeah, I'm glad you're doing well. Again, the girls are a family that we see fairly regularly. It's always nice to see your faces in here. Yeah. All right.

Before I had scleral lenses, um, I had, I had gas permeable lenses and they were so uncomfortable and it always felt like I had glass in my eyes. It felt like, um, my eyes were super dry all the time. I travel often, so I needed something that was comfortable and that I was able to wear for long periods of time. Due to my condition, my condition in both of my eyes, I'm not able to wear glasses and see perfectly. So it was kind of mandatory for me to have contacts in order for me to see, um, exceptionally well. Right. Um, the process itself, it was so easy and the receptionist, everyone in Lumen Optometry, they were just answering all my questions that were so, um, flexible with their schedule. As I said earlier, I travel often, so I needed something, I needed a lot of time, um, to, first of all, I live in Marina Del Rey, so I needed a lot of time, um, to get there and they were just all very flexible with, um, their schedules. The other thing I wanted to say is that, um, the scleral lenses are so comfortable. It's so comfortable. Like, you don't even feel that they are.

And Dr. Tove, um, definitely made sure that it was before I went home. Um, he, he, him and his receptionist made sure that I knew how to take off the lenses because it's a completely different process, um, than the gas permeable lenses that I had before and they made sure that I knew how to put them on by myself before I went home. So that process itself was, um, very thorough and I appreciate that they could, they were concerned about my health when it comes to that. Um, other than that, like I had an overall great experience.

      "my_row: [218, 5800, \"In this video, we'll go over myopia management decision making and some of the flow charts can be for fairly complicated and the tree-all size has one, but I think we like to, I've got it fairly simple, a simplified thing. And so we'll start with atropine here. Okay. So atropine we order from OSRX and it's at .025 and .05 are the percentages that they offer. You can also prescribe 1% if needed with progresses, with transitions. If we know that both parents have a super high prescription and the kid is progressing at a young age, okay, and their axial lengths are larger than they're supposed to be. The no need to worry about it. Doctors have used it for a long period of time. There's a lot more doctors who are scared about using, above never use it, that have opinions about it, but the doctors that have used 1%. Don't worry about it so much. It just works, right? And so atropine I typically say for children under six years old or as a combination treatment. Usually I tend to have there be more little boys on atropine as opposed to little girls because when it comes to little girls they tend to be a little bit more mature and the other options are more available to them. Okay. So these are the percentages we never prescribe .01 and then otherwise as combination treatment, we just consider a complex treatment with ortho-k or with soft multifocals if their axial length progression is greater than about maybe .2 millimeters per year, right? Anyone from .1.15, the truth is pretty normal, I sometimes you get .1 to .15, this is probably a upper limit. You shouldn't really be going above .2. And then the next is soft multifocal contact lenses and I as a breed them, abbreviated SMFCLs. And this is for low myopia. The reason why we mentioned low myopia is because when you're creating an ortho-k and you're asked why my why low myopia for this versus why not just fit them in ortho-k, you're trying to create a certain amount of plus in the pupil. And the thing is is that when you're trying to displace the tissue central, you're trying to displace the central tissue to the paressential area, the red ring, when the prescription is not that low there's actually not that much tissue displacement. So it's a little tough creating all that much plus in the pupil. Most doctors do mention that they still have done it, but I still like to play it safe. I don't, when it comes to wave, you can sort of calculate how much plus you're going to anticipate putting in the pupil and when it comes to low myopia designs, the numbers don't pan out. So I'd still prefer for the young prescriptions for the young kids to wear the soft multifocal and then when they do, I mean ultimately they'll still progress a little bit once they get into the .1.50s or so .1.25, .1.50, then you can switch them over to ortho-k. It's also a great option for parents who are hesitant about ortho-k. Some parents definitely do see the benefits and some patients, even though it's FDA- approved, they get a little bit nervous about sleeping in lenses, even though you explain to them exactly that you're only sleeping in the lenses, you're not, you're not supposed to sleep in normal soft contacts because typically if you're sleeping in them, that meant that you've been wearing them all day long. And that's not the case with ortho-k, but it works well as a bridge. And so again, soft multifocal scan also be used with atropane as well. If actually like there's not under good control. Normally I would start with natural view one day multifocal, unless the parent comes to a specifically mentioning my site one day. The main difference is that the my site one day, since they're the only ones that have the FDA approval for a soft contact, they actually charge a lot more for it. And the natural view tends to work better. It has higher parameters if it's needed and the amount of plus up that's generated out in the periphery is actually quite high. And this pans out even, you can tell for adults to, the adults tend to do a bit better when it comes to the natural view types of designs. As opposed to the standard, Coopervision, Biophinity, Proclear types of multifocal, right? And so for the kids, they get the same amount of higher plus out in the periphery. And then when it comes to ortho-k, well that's a typo. That's for greater than one doctor in myopia. So you're at 125-150 or so. Yeah, if both eyes are 125, then I'll still suggest it or one eye's one, the other ones 150, then I'll still consider ortho-k's. At that point, it's just simpler. Or if they have more cylinder than that, okay. When we design it custom, we can actually knock out vast majority of the sill. Very rare. Do I recall having patients still have sill present? Even if a patient's up to four to three. right that we're the sill typically normally knocks down about half or so when it's customary does take care of it because of our g-sem designs most most standard Non-custom lenses are r-sem unless you go with something like dual-axis or whatnot And so even then the g-sem are more complicated than dual-axis lenses and then ortho care works better for patients who or parents have had lacic for their kids They understand it's almost like a form of lacic, but it's protective and so When it comes to all the treatments, that's basically what we have here and I think it'll get more complicated as we have more treatment options available to us as Spectacle lenses come out, but right now it's basically I imagine really young kids and then kind of in between This is for the best majority of the kids that we're going to meet it definitely has more of the appeal because they can see clear without having to wear glasses, right? And so or alternatively both of these are either one of these combined with that chipping\", 'Doc_MyopiaDesignMaking.wav', 'Myopia Management Decision Making', 'Myopia Management Decision Making']\n",

WILL I SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCLERAL AND SOFT LENSES? Scleral lenses are built from highly- customizable, firm lens materials, which offer clearer vision relative to the standard soft lenses. Example: consider how vision is better through a window versus clear, flexible plastic sheeting. CAN SCLERALS BE WORN THE WHOLE DAY? They can be worn for the full course of the day. Some patients may need to remove and clean the lenses mid day to maintain the best possible comfort and vision. WILL THEY HELP WITH MY DRY EYES? The moisture chamber under the scleral lens will greatly diminish dryness, leading to much more comfortable vision. HOW LONG DOES A SCLERAL LENS LAST? A set of scleral lenses should be replaced every 18- 24 months to maintain healthy vision, comfort, and to avoid lens warpage.ARE SCLERAL LENSES COMFORTABLE? Yes! The lenses are larger so they rest gently on the sclera and the edges are tucked under the eyelid. A well-fitting scleral lens is just as comfortable and less dry than soft contacts. SCLERAL LENSES DONE RIGHT AT LUMEN OPTOMETRIC! First, we start with a topographical scan of the cornea, which allows us to capture the curvature of your eye. We then customize the scleral lens for each individual eye, factoring in the prescription, all while ensuring that the lens rests gently and comfortably on the sclera. Once the lens is designed, we confirm that we’ve met both your visual and comfort demands. Our scleral lens fitting is not complete until you are completely pleased with the results. TO GET STARTED, SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH US AT WWW.LUMENOPTOMETRIC.COM FOR A COMPLIMENTARY CONSULTATION WHERE WE’LL EXPLAIN THE SCLERAL FITTING PROCESS IN MORE DETAIL.WHAT ARE SCLERAL LENSES? Scleral lenses are large diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (clear window of the eye) and gently settle on the sclera (white covering of the eye).WHAT ARE THEIR ADVANTAGES? Clear, stable vision due to the rigid lens design. Increased comfort from the lens resting on the less-sensitive sclera. Decreased dry eye from all- day lubrication of the cornea. WHO CAN HELP? Patients with keratoconus, pellucid, post-surgical glare/blur, compromised corneal integrity (dry eyes, recurrent erosions), high prescriptions, & exacting visual demands (photography, videography, sports).', 'https://www.lumenoptometric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intro_ScleralLenses.pdf', 'SCLERAL LENSES CLEAR & COMFORTABLE VISION WITHOUT COMPROMISE vision is no longer out of reach', 'SCLERAL LENSES FAQ answers to common questions on scleral lenses']\n"
