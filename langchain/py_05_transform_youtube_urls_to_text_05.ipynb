And so she has a little bit of history about Ortho K and if you could fill us in about it. So I did Ortho K when I was a little bit younger, like when I was 18 and then I did it for a couple of years and I have been using the same lenses for a while and later on I decided to try to switch a lens because my vision has gone a little bit worse. So I wanted to see if there's any chances that I can make my original lens a little bit better. So, and my boyfriend introduced me to Lumen, so that's how I come here. Gotcha. All right. So we're done with our fit now and so what's your vision like? It is perfect. I can see pretty far away. Like it used to have a lot of glares when I wore my older lenses. Now I have less glare and then obviously I can, I can actually look like way better at night because before when I was like trying to like go downstairs, I couldn't really see well and sometimes I even like fall, but now it's like a little bit better. Gotcha. Oh, wonderful. Yeah. I think when it comes to Vivian's lenses, she has a bit more myopia and she has a special type of astigmatism that's more internal. So the lenses have to be able to counter, counteract that astigmatism. That's probably what she had before. And since she had the 100% custom lenses, we were able to mold that out. So as of right now, she has pretty much, she has essentially zero astigmatism residual in both eyes. So what about the fitting process? The fitting process is great. Women really like, really pay attention to a lot of details. When I have any concerns, I would just shoot them a text and they're usually just respond right away. I don't have to like wait a couple of days before I get my answers back. And overall, like on the other hand, scheduling is a little bit more difficult, but obviously any like good practice is going to be like this. And usually they are really punctual. They see you mostly on time. Yeah, yeah. We try. We try. Yeah, I know. Especially during the holidays too, the scheduling gets a little bit, we do get a little bit more booked out. But we try. We like to think even though we're booked out when patients get here, that we give them the full 100%. And so we like to think we're worth waiting for, but hopefully you think that's true. But otherwise, it seems like you're happy and we're glad, so we're always here to support you. Okay. So thank you so much for your testimony.

       " Document(page_content=\"Let's learn how to insert your Ortho-K lenses. First, wash your hands thoroughly, and now we're ready to start. For the first week, use the artificial tear comfort drops and place one drop in each eye and allow them to settle for 10 seconds. Now take out the given insertion solution and open it. In this case, it's SolaroFill. Next, take out the cleaning case. Unscrew the case, set aside the bottom half, and take out your right lens. After you take the right lens, balance it on the tip of the index finger of your dominant hand. Now take the insertion solution and place two drops into your right lens. Lean forward into the mirror, take a calming breath, and insert the lens gently. Congratulations! You've successfully inserted your Ortho-K lenses. To remove your Ortho-K lenses, use the SolaroFill and place one drop in each eye and blink several times. Now take the small plunger, center it, and apply light pressure to the lens. Rock the lens off your eye. To clean the lens that you just removed, take the cleaning case and remove the top half. Open up the basket for the right lens and insert the lens into the basket. Very carefully, close the case over the basket, making sure not to clip the lens. Repeat with your left lens. Now take the bottom half of the cleaning case and fill it up to the line on the case. Now take the top half of the case and screw it onto the bottom half. Let the case sit for at least 6 hours to disinfect. Note, never place any drops of the red capped bottle directly into your eye.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e_XRLQvjmE', 'chunk': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"All right, so we have Tony and we have Aiden here and they've gone through our myopia management program. Aiden's currently wearing Ortho-K lenses. And so let's hear it. What do you think about your lenses so far? I like them. Gotcha. So what's it like now when you wake up and the fact that you can see? It's amazing. I'm glad. Okay. Yeah. It's nice to be able to wake up and just see and not have to find your glasses, right? Perfect. Okay. So one thing we keep in mind too is waking up, being able to see is pretty much, it's like a side benefit. It's like a bonus because since Aiden started, his prescriptions been stable with us. And the goal is to keep your prescription low so that your eyes healthier as you get older. Okay. And so we're protecting you there. And then for Tony, what's your experience been like going through the whole process from start to finish? It's been really great. It's been a lot easier than we had anticipated. The initial steps of him getting sized and fitted and everything was really easy. It was painless. Even the initial period when he was getting used to wearing them and putting them in, he struggled the first one to three days. And then after that, we wouldn't even give it a second thought, it was just automatic. We had thought it might be challenging for him to remember to put them on before going to bed and to put them away when he wakes up. But it's just part of his normal routine and I think, and maybe the, I don't even know how long it's been that he's been wearing them now. It's been almost about six months. Six months? Yeah. In that six month period, I think there might've only been one night when he didn't wear them because we got home too late and he was too sleepy to put them in. But aside from that, he's worn them every night and he doesn't seem to have any issues taking them out in the morning. He's transitioned from using the plunger to not using the plunger and he can just take it out without using it. So that's been really easy. We haven't experienced anything adverse. He does a lot of physical activities of biking and bodyboarding and snowboarding season's coming back up again. It's great for him to be able to do all these things without needing glasses or us having to fiddle with getting prescription goggles or anything like that. So it's really, really wonderful. Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. It sounds like, especially since you're so active, it's really been helpful for you. Especially with snowboarding. I hear there's a bunch of snow on the mountain high, so that would be perfect. Or especially when you guys stay at Big Bear, right? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. I feel like it's really, I mean, it's great for the kids. It's really great for the parents to not have to worry about him losing a contact or breaking glasses or forgetting to bring glasses. He's ready to go whenever it's time to do something. Gotcha. Yeah. Especially when it's all under parental supervision. So you know the lens, if something falls out of his eye, it's going to be at home. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well, thank you so much for your input. I really appreciate it. And thanks for trusting us with your care. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. We appreciate it. \", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xgYtUvPpX0', 'chunk': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, it's Dr. Toe here. I just have a quick message to deliver on a great tip that I learned about face masks and glasses fogging up. So if you do wear your glasses throughout the day or even on the computer and you find that they're constantly fogging up, this tip will be perfect for you. So let me show you what to do. So let me hook this one on here first. And so what you need for this tip is a piece of tissue paper. And so I have the tissue, fold it once, fold it twice, fold it three times, and one last fold. And this fold will be essentially the width of your mask, okay? So there we go. And now if you have your face mask, you want to place it right over the nose piece right here. And make sure the nose piece is well contoured for your nose. If you place this on, and there we go. So it reduces the amount of fog coming through. I like to think of it as an accordion sort of gasket to keep the moisture from moving up there. And so hopefully this helps you out. Now one big thing to remind you of though is throughout the day, if you are in contact with anybody where there's any potential COVID in the air, you want to make sure you're not constantly touching your mask. So in the very beginning of the day, if you do this, then that's perfectly fine when you know that your hands are clean and disinfected. But if you're midway through the day, you don't want to take off your mask and futz with it, and then put it back on your face. That's definitely something you don't want to do, okay? Otherwise, any other questions at the end, you'll have our information pop up about our website and the phone numbers that you can call or text us. And I want to put a shout out to Dr. Tony Liu for helping us out with this great tip. It was wonderful.

Tanya, do you remember before you had CRT? Like for you, sports are important, right? Which sports do you play? I play soccer, swimming, and I used to play tennis, but then I stopped playing tennis. Oh, gotcha. Okay, so three sports. And so what was it like before you had CRT for soccer and for swimming? For soccer, like sometimes like when I would run a lot, it would all like, like over here, it would get sweaty, so sometimes it would fall off. So sometimes I like didn't want to play with them, but I had to because like I couldn't really see really well without them. So everything's been good for you? You're happy with how you can wake, happy that you can wake up and see nice and clear? Yeah. Yeah, I'm glad. All right, thank you. And then for Bon, and Bon, you know, we've definitely spoken a lot. We always try to provide Bon with as much information so that she knows that we're taking the best care of Tanya. And so what about your experiences? What do you, what do you think? Like for me, I like so, so much, like even like at school, even like lots of things, like no broken glasses, no changing, no like lost, lost glasses. Also her face looked different, like and more comfortable with the class, with like sports, all this stuff. And it is easy, like in the beginning, she like, one day she learned how to put them in and take them off and that's it. Yeah, she was, she was really dedicated. She's probably one of the most dedicated little ones in terms of learning how to insert that lens. You can tell she, in the beginning, you know, it was a little tough, but from watching Tanya, like she's going to get it and she'll, she gets it, you know, it's going to, it's going to be there for forever. Yeah, like it make, like one of my friends, like when she saw Tanya without the glasses, she said, oh my God, like her face, it's like, the people who wear sometimes the glasses, even like for Tanya, because it is very hot, like sometimes do like this. So take the habit doing like this, her face like shrinking like that, but now it's open. She said her face is much open. I can see her smile better. Everything is much better. Yeah, don't hide behind the glasses anymore. Yeah, we were speaking about this a little before we decided to record the video and you had mentioned even about just confidence levels. Yeah. And so that's, that's one thing as a practitioner we see all the time. Yeah. My other daughter, like she doesn't like them and she's struggling with her friend and they ask her, why are you wearing them? Why? So I start telling them, tell them I, because I'm clever. I read a lot only to make her feel different. Like why she's wearing glasses, like, not like other people, which is normal. But Tanya now, like a normal people doesn't wear any glasses and no one knows, like she has contact lenses at night and take them off in the morning. Yeah. It's really special. And it's easy to clean them, put them like, and everything easy for her. Yeah. It's, it's, it's really special watching her, her girl, help them be more confident and it's rewarding on our side. I mean, you get to see her every day that way. So all right. So you approve, you would, you would, if you would do it all over again, if, if. For sure. Yeah. No, no, as for this question, like I feel different, like for her also, when she participate in any sport, anything, it is not like wearing glasses. I was afraid when we go to a birthday party, always I take them from them because they, there is other kids pushing, there is jumping. So I prefer not to wear them because maybe it's broken and they get a scratch or whatever. But now it is like an issue. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you very much for your testimonial.

       " Document(page_content=\"This is an eye looking straight up towards the ceiling, and this is an ortho-k lens placed on the eye. Ortho-k lenses are shaped differently than standard contacts. They take on what I call a volcanic shape. Ortho-k lenses work by creating negative pressure, also known as suction, in the region under these humps. The cells then migrate and multiply in this region, ever so slightly thickening the zone. The cornea then takes on the shape of the ortho-k retainer lens. Now here's why ortho-k is special. Let's go back to the picture that we sketched in a previous Why do eyes get worse video. Remember how traditional glasses and contacts over corrected your child's peripheral vision, which led to the accelerated growth of the eye? With ortho-k, there's a unique optical effect that occurs. First, it allows your child to maintain clear vision wherever they're looking. Optically, ortho-k lenses cause the peripheral vision to be focused inside of the eye instead of behind it. Because the peripheral vision is focused inside of the eye, it reduces the stimulus for accelerated growth. And without the stimulus for growth, the eye will retain a smaller shape and your child's eyes will remain healthier for life.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhtuaIazLIw', 'chunk': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Alright, so we've got Prom here and we just finished our S-MAP slurl fit and so how are the lenses feeling for you? Oh, they're great. Good, good, okay. And so, could you describe a little bit about your vision overall when you had slurls and versus when you didn't have slurls? So, a little history on my background is I did LASIK, found out I had Cerebral Conus because after LASIK my vision kept dropping on my right eye. From there, my vision just basically was getting worse and worse. I got crosslinking done, after crosslinking my vision stayed at one point, but since my vision was, I would say, really bad to the point on my right eye where this is the clarity that I needed, like something had to be this close for my right eye to be able to even see it clearly. It was throwing off my vision compared to my left eye, which is a lot stronger. So, slurl lenses has helped me correct my vision where now I'm able to drive and I'm able to do my work and especially needed being in the tech industry, I need my eyes for that reason alone. Yeah, yeah. Prom's a busy guy, so for him to be able to use his eyes without having to think about it throughout the day, just being there for him to be able to see clearer is always important. And so, yeah, thanks for giving us your video testimonial here. And it's funny, whenever we help patients with slurl lenses, we start building relationships and Prom's one of those patients where every single, when we see him every single time, I would always enjoy hearing what he's got to do. And so, we're going to miss seeing you for a little bit of time until we start up next year's lenses again. Yeah. So, thanks. Thank you. \", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4GfHJCOcAk', 'chunk': 0}),\n",

Let's go before OrthoK, right? What was your vision like before you started? Really blurry and really hard to see. Like when I go to school, I would have to move into the black to see. Yeah, not fun when it's blurry, huh? Yeah, so you see Emily's always kind of one of our giggly patients. We love to see her. So what about your vision now? What's your vision like now? Really clear and I can see without glasses, so that's good. Yeah, and so when you're, especially when you wake up, it must be nice being able to see clear without having to, without having to find glasses or any contacts, right? Yeah. Okay. And you're happy with how you're, how you're seeing and how your eyes feel when you wake up now? Yeah. Okay. And then Marcel, as a, as a, as a mom, do you have any input on, on the whole process that, that in order to get her to seeing at a clear point? Any input on that? I just love it. Like, I mean, from her being, she won't be able to see blurry. And from all this process, it's been like not even a long term and she's been processing like progress so well, which I love it. And you guys go detail by detail and tell me what's going on and it's a lot of improvement. Yeah. I mean, her, you guys are easy to work with. So it makes it easy on our end. So we're glad to keep you in the loop. We always try to educate you as much as we can so that you don't feel like we've left anything out. So hopefully you felt that way. Yes, I do. Thank you. Perfect. Perfect. So, so far, everyone's happy with everything. Yes, we are. I'm glad. Okay, perfect. So yeah, we'll be seeing you. For all of our patients, we always see them back after a stable point. Roughly around quarterly or so just to monitor to make sure her eyes stay healthy.

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, it's Dr. To from Lumen Optometric and I'm just checking in to make sure that you guys are still doing well, staying healthy out there. And so I'm recording this today just to make sure that we have a little bit more clarity in terms of contact lenses. I've been seeing some news reports that mention that contact lenses aren't healthy to wear during times of the COVID pandemic. And I just want to make sure that everybody knows that there's absolutely no scientific basis, there's no studies that point towards any contact lens wear being unhealthy. And so there's some very specific guidelines to follow to make sure that you're wearing contact lenses in a healthy manner. And so most of these we've gone over with you in training or after you've worn contacts just as a quick touch point. And so one thing is to make sure your eyes washing your hands, okay, so 20 seconds is what we're aiming for here, I'd say a good solid 10 seconds of soaping, 10 seconds of rinsing and drying your hands very well, then and only then should you handle your lenses in the morning. So place them in and the rest of the day, as long as you're not touching your eyes or your face, then you'll be perfectly fine. In terms of disinfection, you have to make sure that you're disinfecting them well too. So most of the times we prefer the peroxide based solution, cleansers, and so usually you'll have a little case and you'll fill it with a solution that has a red cap and after six hours, it'll be completely disinfected. So if you're wearing lenses that you discard every two weeks or every month, or if you're wearing corneal reshaping lenses, you definitely want to make sure you're continuously cleaning your lenses every night or throughout the day, depending on how you wear your lenses. Now for daily disposables, when you do remove them at the end of the day, make sure again, your hands are clean, but you would just discard those lenses, okay? So again, so long as you're keeping your hands clean and you're disinfecting your lenses, there's nothing to worry about in terms of wearing your contact lenses. Again, if you have any questions, give us a call or you can email us or text us on our main line. You can find all that information on our website and hopefully we'll get to see you guys soon. It's been almost about a month that we've closed our doors temporarily. We really miss all of you and so take care and take care of one another, okay?

So let's, let's go, let's go back in time. Tell us about how your eyes work. Okay. So, um, I'm 52 and when I, the last probably five years, my eyes have been getting progressively worse, but it got to the point where I was up to like almost 3.0 readers. And if I was without my glasses, I was literally, I felt blind. It was kind of scary. It was a little bit scary. I felt like it's something really wrong. I didn't know if there was something really wrong with my eyes or I was just getting old. So I booked an appointment here because I didn't have a really an eye doctor that I had been using. I've been sort of self doing my readers. And so that was it. So then I ended up here and that's when I found out about ortho. Okay. I didn't know about it before. So great. So what's your vision like now? It's great. I don't even need glasses at all. So I don't use that. I don't use readers. My distance is fine and it's the greatest thing ever. I feel like I'm about 25 again. Sounds wonderful. Yeah. I still have patients. It's like where it was specifically when it comes to your situation, right? Because you're farsighted. And so for the longest time, I mean, you didn't wear glasses up until pretty recently. Yeah. Yeah. So your distance was always fairly good. And then all of a sudden your reading starts to go and then your distance follows along with that. Yeah. And I didn't even realize my distance was bad until my eye exam. Like I didn't even think I had, I would never have guessed I even had a little distance issue, but this worked out perfect. I've told so many people, my sister wants to do it. She's in Northern California. I'm like, I don't know how you're going to do the fall appointments, but come on down. Sounds like you've been having a great time. What about, yeah. What about your experience here? It was great. I mean, you guys were, I couldn't believe how many, I've never had more eye tests. It was so thorough. It was wonderful. You explained everything. I felt like I was completely understood what I was getting into. And it was well worthy of this. And it was the best thing I've ever done. I thank you for that. I thank you for having my vision again. Because truly I, it's a gift, a gift to have vision again. And you don't realize it until you're losing it and how scary that feeling is. So it's wonderful. I really appreciate it. Well, thank you so much for telling us your story. We're glad to be able to take care of you. You must feel great. It's like giving someone their youth back. I don't know.

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, this is Lumen Optometric here, and we have some really exciting news to share with you. We're the first practice in Los Angeles County that's partnered with Treehouse Eyes, which is the national leader in myopia care for kids. And our goal is to provide the latest forms of treatments for myopia for your children to keep their eyes healthy for life. And myopia has been more of an issue. It has to do with all the screen time nowadays, kids have to spend much more time indoors, especially staying at home, staring at their screens as opposed to going to school. There's a lot less time spent outdoors, and all that research points to their eyes worsening. And what we also know now through research is that glasses and standard contacts also worsen myopia as well. And all this is a problem because myopia is unchecked growth of the eye. And so when the eye stretches, all the internal elements aren't meant to stretch that much. So when they're forced to stretch, it leads to greater risks of eye diseases in life, which is not great for their vision. Additionally, it's more difficult to get through life with a very high prescription as opposed to a very small prescription. Now, since we've partnered with Treehouse Eyes, we've been making investments in technology. And the technology allows us to more accurately and quickly monitor your child's myopic progression, so that we can combine research treatments to be able to slow or stop that progression. Now, for more information, you can look down below for our phone number, give us a call, and we'll guide you through it. You can also look on our website under myopia management. There's a lot more information about the specific types of treatments we offer, in addition to the technology that we employ to keep your children's eyes healthy. Now, if we work together, we can keep your children's eyes healthy for life. Okay, hope to see you soon.

And so, what was your life like with previously having a bigger prescription? Previously, I have worn glasses since I was in fourth grade. So about, what is that, eight, nine years old. And it was, you know, part of my life and I never really imagined anything different. I just assumed that's how it would be. I tried contacts for a while and I found that kind of irritating my eye through the day. So I took some time off wearing contacts and just assumed I'd be wearing glasses for the rest of forever. Yeah, and so I remember the day that I had proposed this idea to Ortho-K. You're pretty fired up about it. You're ready to go. Yeah, I was excited. It sounded very innovative and I hadn't heard of it before. So tell us, how's it like now? You've been wearing it for about two and a half weeks. So Lynette's at a pretty stable point. There will be some subtle shifts for her and always in a better direction. But how have your eyes been feeling? Amazing. I'm really excited. I could wake up in the morning and get to see right when I wake up. I'm not fumbling around. I can make my way to the restroom to take off my lenses. Then through the day, it's been awesome. I can see now at night the stars with my own eyes, which I hadn't done since I can't even remember. And that was a really special moment to just get to see clearly without the obstruction of lenses or irritation from my contacts. Yeah, it's funny when we take certain things for granted. But when people have clear vision and they just wake up and they see clear, we take it for granted. We're kind of given that option that it's so different and refreshing.

So before you had the NeuroLens, I mean, how did your eyes feel at work when you were staring at the computer? They got very tired. I had a hard time after a while focusing on, like, spreadsheets, for example. I would get headaches, and honestly, I would avoid some of that close work. Yeah, I know, it's not comfortable, especially when we're on the computer for so many hours a day, or a computer, and we're staring at our phones now, too, and so when we think about the NeuroLens, is there a prescribe specifically just for the computer to wear over your contacts, and how does it feel now? Great! A lot better. I put them on only when I'm working on the computer, and I'm able to work comfortably for a few hours at a time, and I'm not getting the dry eye and the headaches that I had before. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, these symptoms do come, for some patients, they all come together. Patients will have headaches, or dryness specifically is a big one. For some patients, they have dry eye symptoms, but their eyes technically aren't dry when we look for signs of dryness, and so sometimes lenses like NeuroLens can ease those symptoms, too. And they've been really helping you out then, right? They have, yes. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I'm glad. Okay, so thank you for sharing your story with us. You're welcome.

       " Document(page_content=\"All right, so we have Leslie here, and she's wearing neural lenses, and so can you talk a little bit about what your symptoms were like in the very beginning? Yes. I had really extreme eye fatigue to the point where I couldn't even drive anymore, and I was getting really scared that it was going to be forever. I would have extremely gritty feeling in my eyes. I would have to drive with one eye closed and then switch to the other eye. I would go through bottles of drops in a couple of weeks, and of course headaches and back aches, but really primarily I just felt like my eyes were in total pain, like I had a rubber band wrapped around them, and there was a whole bunch of sand in there. It was very painful. So good news now. It doesn't feel that way anymore, huh? Yeah. It's a huge difference, really huge. I can drive again. I was saying that one of my triggers was being in a dark room with lit screens, which was terrible for work meetings. I would sit in those meetings with my eyes closed, and people would think I was bored or tired. It was very embarrassing. I had to explain it to everybody, but I had a big test where I was at a conference for a whole week like this, and it was pretty great. I could go the whole day at the conference without problems. Yeah, that's wonderful. I mean, being able to do what you need to do without having all that discomfort, it really adds up. You think about the little bits of discomfort throughout the day, and you stretch it out over 8 to 10, 12 hours, and then it really starts adding up. I'm in animal care, and quality of life is something we discuss a lot, and my quality of life was pretty low, because it was on my mind just constantly, constantly bothering me.

Hey, do you have these symptoms? You should see a specialist if you're in the area. So, yeah. I will be singing the praises of these lenses for sure. Yeah, I'm glad they really help you. What about your skepticism? Yeah, I was going to say, I was really skeptical. The thing is, I could see just fine, and for the most part, everything seemed like the glasses I was wearing was suited for what I needed, but I was having some sort of internal problem. In a way, I was, but really, I just didn't understand how lenses could fix that problem. But these are complex lenses, and they're really amazing, and my husband and I both did all the research. We thought it sounded a little cuckoo, but it was our last thing to try. So, really, it's, I am, I believe it now. Yeah. I'm so glad that they're working out for you. It sounds like such a cliche.

       " Document(page_content=\"All right, so we have Natasha here. Natasha is going to help us out with an Ortho-K testimonial. So, tell us about how was your vision before Ortho-K? So, I had pretty moderate astigmatism and myopia. I had LASIK about 13 years ago and thought that I'd have a good long period of time without glasses after that, but unfortunately my astigmatism came back pretty meaningfully. And I tried a lot of different solutions to address it, soft contacts, glasses. I got re-evaluated for TouchUp LASIK, PRK, all kinds of different solutions. And ultimately, the only really comfortable way to address it was through wearing glasses. And after having enjoyed a period of time without glasses after LASIK, I was really looking for another option to go back to being able to go about my day without wearing anything and having kind of easy get up and go routine. And so, after I learned about Ortho-K, I started to research options and that seemed like a good fit for me. Gotcha. So, what's your vision like now? So, after a period of adjustment, it's great. I can see really clearly. I don't need glasses in the morning. I've gotten to a point now where things have settled where I don't even need glasses to read or work during the day. And it's super convenient. I'm really happy with the results. I'm glad. Yeah, the astigmatism is no joke. I mean, you're seeing quite a bit of shadows on things before. A lot of fuzziness, a lot of doubles of things, especially when I read books or when I read things on a computer. And that is like greatly diminished almost to a part where I can't notice it anymore. I know. In the past, when we're looking at the chart there, we're stuck at around 2050, 2070, but now we're really scrutinizing the 2020 line. Exactly, exactly. Yes, I'm super happy about that. Very excited. I'm glad. So, how about your experience? Did you feel as if we took good care of you? Yeah, yeah. I think for me, it was really important to find a place where, you know, you were using like the latest technology, using all the right tools. I think the process that we went through, there were a lot. I felt really good about the quality in terms of both the service and then also the equipment that you're using to get measurements. And then when I got the lenses that also felt really high quality and we've been able to adjust the lenses over time through all the customization that you do to get to a really good fit. And so, you know, for something that I heard by reputation wasn't super comfortable to wear, they're actually pretty comfortable. You know, I don't really notice it when I go to sleep at night. And so, it's all around been a really good experience. I'm glad. And the team is great. Really nice. Everyone's really helpful and the service is really great. Hey, Natasha is really easy to work with. She's super mellow and easygoing. So, thank you so much for telling your story and we appreciate your time. I'm kind of surprised that not more people know about OrthoK actually. I think people have an impression that it's more for younger kids, which is actually how I knew about it in the first place. But having this as an option, not having to do LASIK and deal with all the potential complications, if I had known that this was an option years ago, I probably would have done this instead. Yeah, but a lot of times practitioners who do fit it don't always bring it up for adults because adults are a lot more discerning. Right. So, it does usually take more effort when it comes to adults. Interesting. But I like fine-tuning. I mean, it makes it happy. Definitely, it's more vision-changing, life-changing. Yeah, and having the option to change it over time as my vision changes would have been a meaningful thing to understand about LASIK. They kind of warn you about that, but the way that they position it is when you get old enough to have to use reading glasses, that's when you will go back to glasses. They don't talk about astigmatism coming back, right? And that's, I think, I gather more common than, you know, I understood. So, if I had known that, I probably would have more seriously considered this. All right. Well, thank you so much. For sure.

So how's your day going? Good. Good? All right. Yeah, so in terms of your vision, I mean, you were diagnosed with keratoconus, and so I think when I first saw you, do you remember some of your initial complaints? Yeah, I had a lot of glare wearing my glasses. I had, I couldn't necessarily see, even with like a new updated prescription, I couldn't see very clearly, very long distance, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I remember when we tried glasses on you initially, and the glasses, there was sort of a limit to your vision, and it's because the cornea is distorted when it comes to keratoconus, so having the scleral lens effectively gives you a new surface to work from. So how's your vision now? My vision is better. It's improved. I can see more clearly. The details of what I can see now, it's just, I mean, they're magnified. I mean, they're just, it's impressive how much I can see, which, yeah, I never knew you could see that many details. Yeah. I think, yeah, you were talking about even being able to see dry skin on your kid's teeth. Dry skin patches, I can see very tiny hair follicles on people's faces. Yeah. That's the interesting part. Yeah. Yeah. I can see a lot of details. Yeah, positives and negatives there. So I think in terms of glare, I did cut down some glare. I think erasing all the glare is still a difficult task, but I think, would you say it's still substantially reduced and more comfortable to drive now? It is, yeah. It is very comfortable to drive, especially during daytime. I, um, it's just, um, yeah, it's like distance wise, I can see better. Um, the, yeah, the glare part, I, it doesn't, I notice it obviously in the evening, but it doesn't bother me as much. Yeah. That's the part that has really improved. And then how about comfort with your lenses on? I, I don't feel them. So, um, perhaps I've gotten used to it, but I, years ago I had tried, um, uh, soft lenses I guess, contacts, and it felt like there was sand in my eyes. I mean, it was just like really uncomfortable. I couldn't get used to them. And these, I don't feel these, I, I can wear them for 12 hours. And, um, there was a day where I wore them longer than 12 hours and it was still comfortable. You know, see, well, I was working on the computer and it was just really, everything was really intact. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. And when it comes to these, I mean, you, since you're familiar with how you fill them up are, uh, the listeners might not be, but you basically fill it with solution and then you place it in the eye. So it's holding solution up against your eye all day long. Whereas soft contacts, if you take it out of your eye and you put it on the table, it basically turns into a potato chip about a minute later. Where these hold their structure and they don't require your tears in order to stay hydrated. Yeah. No, and I do. And I feel that I feel the hydration with the solution. It feels, yeah, I do feel it. That's like a damn cool feeling. It's like air conditioning for your eyes without the dryness. Yeah. That's how it feels. Yeah. So overall, it sounds like you're happy with this. Yes. It's perfect. And I wasn't sure I was going to be, and in the beginning it was challenging to put them on, but that lasted only, I don't know, maybe a week and I became more comfortable with it. Yeah.

This is what is required to see clearly. For our young patients that become myopic, which leads to nearsightedness, their eyes elongate and the world now falls out of focus. Glasses or contacts are traditionally used to correct this blur. But, as myopic parents know, the first pair of glasses or contacts is never the last. When a child wears traditional glasses or contacts, it corrects their central vision. But it wasn't until recently that we learned two new things. First, we learned that traditional glasses and contacts overcorrect their peripheral vision. Second, we learned that the brain pays more attention to the peripheral vision to regulate how the eye grows. Since the brain is watching this region, it grows the eye to land itself back on the plane of clear vision. This cycle repeats itself over and over again into adulthood, leading to worsening vision and eye health.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZrM2L1h8w', 'chunk': 0}),\n",

I was 16 years old, I remember at the time, and those took a little bit of getting used to. But I had, at the time, they also didn't have the material that they have for lenses now, so I had the big Coke bottle lenses for glasses, and I looked just hideous, and for a 16 year old girl, that was just not going to work. So yeah, so I had regular hard contact lenses for a long time. And then, I think I didn't wear any contact lenses at all for quite a while, I just wore glasses, and I would like every year or two just get my prescription change with my glasses, and then I got soft contact lenses and I did that for a bit. Oh yeah, and in between there, I had cast permeable ones. So I've kind of gone the gamut of whatever there is, but yeah, these are the best. I can really see great out of these. And comfort's good for you too. Yeah, the comfort is pretty good. So yeah, you've been really great about the fitting and about making sure that my prescription is right. I really appreciate the care that you've taken, you know, because I haven't always had that. Well, thank you so much. All right. Thank you.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEkxyL02tSs', 'chunk': 0}),\n",

I like them very much, very comfortable, more than the ones I had. Oh, excellent. Yeah, Irma used to wear a previous type of SLARO lens, and now when it comes to the SLARO lenses, she's wearing the S-MAP, so they're fully mapped to her eye, and so we were able to get her there in, usually, probably a little fewer visits compared to in the past with her standard SLARO lenses, and so, so vision's clear for you at this point? Yes. Yeah, yeah. I can drive better. Excellent, yeah, and a little safer for you overall in the daytime, okay, and then when you insert them, do you find that it's a little bit easier, more comfortable, too, because of the size of the lenses? Yes, they're smaller than the ones I had. Good, okay, I'm glad. So overall, two thumbs up for you? Yes. Are you happy? Yes, they're very good.

Before wearing CRT it was, I had to wear contacts in which it was difficult because it was a risk of me like ear falling out or like the a bit bothering me and also sometimes it would get blurry which I had to always have to run to class and before that even I had to wear glasses in which again the risk of you're breaking it or scratching or just or and also playing sports like basketball or baseball hit in your eye. When we met Sean, Sean was about a foot shorter and now he's grown so much but his prescription back in the day was was really large I mean it was minus I believe it was minus eight minus two so it was quite a significant prescription and so nowadays his prescription hasn't changed and it's been very very stable and so I mean afterwards well do you remember your first night waking up what it was like? From the first night I was very excited that my vision will eventually get better because that was my dream of like I always wanted to see 2020 and just I feel very excited for it it was unbelievable I was thinking when I was younger I always like thought like something to help me with this vision now that we have the solution I was glad I was grateful. It's rewarding to see that that you enjoyed it so much yeah and so what about the fitting process and what did you think about the whole fitting process for Sean? Well when we started talking and you recommended this process I believe that it went very smoothly obviously there's a lot of benefits to it because in addition to his vision also the health concerns about his vision just getting worse over time so but the fitting process went very slowly it went very well you're you're you always answered all our questions so we really appreciate that I think it went great and it's still going great so we're very happy with that I'm glad yeah it's when you when you join our program you guys are almost like family you know you text me whenever yeah absolutely we we definitely appreciate all the all the feedback too we all the questions we have are answered and I think him having something not to worry about all the time during the day is much better because he puts them on at night takes them off in the morning I think it's a much smoother process for him and of course his vision his health those are very important things for us so yeah and so we're monitoring we'll make sure everything's healthy you know we just today we took your axial length and we have the stable measurements there and we'll just monitor your ear to make sure you're not changing yeah so any any any tips for for parents who are watching this video I would recommend it it's I mean it's better overall you can overall help you with your vision and then you don't have to worry about any of the risks like having 2020 for like the entire day and having it will just benefit you overall your vision yeah that's a great recommendation all right thank you two really appreciate it\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk96_v9_6qs', 'chunk': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"So here we have Aiden and we have Patty and they're helping us with a video testimonial for specifically myopia management with Ortho K and so that sounds like to start with in the past so can you tell us about what your vision was like in the past Aiden? In the past I would have to wear glasses and it wouldn't be really easy to see so I would have to squint a lot and I always had to change glasses because my eyes would always get worse each year. Yeah your prescription was pretty high do you mind if I share his prescription? Yeah so Aiden's prescription it's around approximately minus six minus four diopters so he has a lot of astigmatism he has more astigmatism than most people have myopia so quite significant and so definitely needed your glasses in order to see right? Yes. Yeah so how's your vision now after wearing Ortho K? Much better. Yeah I'm glad it's neat being able to wake up and see clear yeah? Yes. Perfect perfect okay and you don't have to deal with foggy glasses or anything like that? No. Oh I see yeah so the nicest part waking up and just not having to find your glasses it's like you don't have to put on your eyes in the morning. Yes much easier. I'm glad I'm glad and then from Patty's perspective as a parent I mean did you feel as if we we educated through the whole process that all the gaps were filled and that Aiden was in good control? Right yes from the very beginning when we came in for our initial visit you explained things more than anybody else we we actually went to a lot of different offices but you actually explained the process of Ortho K even though we read a lot before the way you explained it explained gave a lot of more information and it was good that he listened to it and heard it as well from you versus just from his mom and the whole process you work you walk us through you're always available for questions I didn't expect you to respond so quickly like to some of my late texts everyday too but you're always available for our questions so we appreciate that. Thank you yeah we work as a team so we always try to involve our patients because if Aiden's on board then we're ready to rock and roll if he's not on board then we've got some talking to do. I remember we came almost every week for the for the training with the eye so I appreciate your staff's patience they're always upbeat and they're always patient with him and us even though we came week after week and that was like second nature to him but in the beginning it was really tough. Yeah you learn so fast though I mean in the beginning you think about that one instrument that scans your eye you didn't even let us get close to your eye with that instrument so you think of where you started and where you are now and the strides that you made it's really mind-blowing you really went really far really fast so he's had to kind of teach you the ropes and then you pulled yourself up and you now you're doing great so yeah so thank you so much for your testimonial and really appreciate the the dedication you know the Heidi's really on it she's one of those moms where we know that she's every aspect of it she's got it under control and she's taking really good care so she's actually one of our our favorite mom patients that comes in to take care of this because we know she loves her kids so much you can tell um and I wish I had been sooner I just wish I'd been sooner. That's okay the information out there is a little tough to find truthfully because unless you stumble upon myopia management or or the words ortho k it's not as well known as as like let's say orthodontia and so but but yeah it's getting more traction and and the results are there for themselves again Aiden's happy with his vision he's got a huge honking prescription so so thank you so much.

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, it's Eric To from Lumen Optometric, and today I wanted to share with you my tutorial for converting this Honeywell HPA 300 HEPA filter to create a negative pressure environment in your exam rooms. And the reason why I decided to find a way to do this, there weren't any current guides and there's very little talk about negative pressure rooms for private practitioners like ourselves. But, I mean, with the case numbers going up everywhere, and I mean, at Lumen we really employ all the different techniques to keep things healthy. I mean, we disinfect everything, patients are screened at the door, everything is scheduled online, filled in online in terms of our exams. They're even broken up into separate rooms where I interview patients from a separate room from the exam environment, so that room can purify with HEPA filtration. But to me, given the numbers and the state of where we currently are, I don't think it's enough. So hopefully if you find this tutorial helpful, it'll keep your staff and it'll keep yourself and your patients a little healthier. So first, to start, you need the Honeywell HPA 300. This is fairly oversized for a typical exam room. My exam rooms are a little over 80 square feet, so if you're anywhere from 80 to 100, I'm fairly certain that when you kick it into turbo mode, and once you account for all the different leaks in your room, that you should be able to hit the recommended negative 0.01 inches water column. With this one, we definitely hit it in our room. So if your rooms are about the same size, you should be fine there too. So get the unit, make sure it's unplugged. Actually, before you do any of this, make sure it works first. So plug it in, fire it up, and then unplug it. And so what you'll need is a Torx screw set. And so this bit right here is a Torx 15, but it is the security version. So in the very center, there'll be a little divot, and that'll be necessary so that you can actually loosen the screws that were not really intended to be loosened. And so there's six of them. There's one, two, three, which is mirrored on the other side. So some of them are a little tight initially. So good luck on taking those out, and we'll pause for a second, and we'll move to the next step after. Okay, so all the screws are undone at this point, and this is where our goal is to take this thing apart without breaking clips. Luckily, it's not too bad. And once you take all those off, then you can start to pull the bottom half away from the rest of the unit, and all the clips are on the top, this top ring here, and it inserts into this plastic piece here. So as you pull away, if you pull downward, and you sort of push on this area here, too, you can actually see some of the clips. There we go. Even if you break the clips, it's not a huge deal, and it all gets tucked underneath there. But what is important to take out, I'll show you in a second. There we go. It's these little wings on the edge here. You'll be able to see them. Okay, so you pull this thing away, and do be careful. Depending on the surface, this can tip forward. Okay, so this piece you won't need for a while, so you can set it aside. And that's the internals here. So that's the fan. The rest of it, basically, the next step is, there's screws in this area. So these are just two Phillips screw heads. So just remove both of these. Okay, so we'll pause here as well. With those two Phillips head removed, then you can take this top panel off. This one will always stay connected because of the cables here. Mine obviously looks a little different because this was the first version that I had built out just to mess with. And so when you had just one exhaust duct like I had first built it out, I couldn't hit the .01 because there was just too much of an obstruction to airflow. And let's see. So you pop it off pretty much the exact same way. So you've got the little clips that you have to be careful about. Okay, so this goes to the front piece here. And basically what I was doing most of the time in terms of the front piece was just to support it. Usually if I'm doing this at home, it'll tip over if it's on a carpet, but here it's fine. Okay, so now we're getting a closer look at the top grill here. And so you notice this area is cut out. And so this is where the first exhaust vent pulls through here. And so you just have to take a Dremel and cut really nicely through all this one. The tricky part is you have this one card sleeve that's built into the HPA300. Once you have it, you'll see it. And there's a little Phillips head screw. You have to unscrew that so that you can pull out the plastic cards. Otherwise, you still do need to Dremel off this piece. So this is actually going to be my revision 2.0 since I'm adding two exhaust vents instead of one. So what you'll want to do is with your Dremel to continue cutting this whole section off too. So this whole area will be just as bare as this area. It'll be essentially almost mirrored there as well. So get out your Dremel, put on your safety goggles, and watch out for your hands. Put on gloves if you need and cut that whole part out. Since I'm disassembling this one, you'll get a chance to see exactly sort of what the near-end product looks like here. So you have this top cover, this white cover here right next to that surrounds the whole pipe. And that keeps the unit from venting out or exhausting from anywhere other than that vent pipe. And so all that yellow sort of dough looking stuff is actually just gap filler. And so in a few moments, I'll show you what that looks like. All these things were purchased at Home Depot. I mean, the downspout is essentially a rain gutter. Found those from Home Depot too. You usually find that all the way in the back with the raw materials. Fairly, usually an aisle or two away from that is where you find the gap filler as well. So since we're working backwards, let me pop this out here. So here's a close-up of what it looks like on the inside of this vent here. So you can see this vent is basically, in terms of the exhaust, that's the end of the road in terms of how the air would flow. The normal unit, the air exhausts up all the way through this whole space. All the way through here is one whole exhaust vent. So basically, the way that I've set this up here is that this is as far as it goes before venting. And so it wasn't enough. So basically, that's what I've cut out this extra hole for. That's for the secondary version of this to sit in here. So what I'll have to do in a second is I'll show you exactly how I've cut these pipes in order for them to work. This is kind of an overview for you to understand how it works out. Once you kind of get an idea of how it's set up, then you actually can sort of wing it. Anyway, so the expanding foam fills in all the gaps so that the air can't escape past this vent right here. And it's the same on that side too. One of the reasons why I took this thing off is it's actually glued down a little. It's pretty tight. And so that's how that part works. I have the template for this top piece. All you have to do is print it out, tape them together, overlay it on some foam core board, which is what I have here. You'll still have to test fit it. There's a little bit of variance with these units. I found even between my two units. Cut out the holes, and then you'll have to cut out the downspouts You do want to take some preliminary measurements before you start to cut here. This is the first piece that you do want to cut out. This one I would cut out to be around 7 inches. No more than 8 inches. There's a little bit of flexibility, but the problem is once you start getting really tall, this piece, since it's connected and you've cut a hole into it, you won't be able to pull it over too long of a tube. If you keep it to about 7 to 7.5 inches, you'll have enough space here. Cut that 7.5 inch piece of downspout first. In terms of how you want that shape to be cut out, this one I couldn't pull out. It's already glued in there. For the most part, you want it to be open-faced. You'll basically cut that and that's what you can see that I've done essentially here. In terms of the height of that, for me it's about 3.25 inches. You'll know exactly what yours will be because once you cut out these holes from the template and you stick your 7.5 inch piece through that hole and you drop the foam down as far as it'll go for you, then you want to measure from the very front of it, not from the bottom of the filter though because that whole bottom section of the filter here, if you can use an imaginary line, it's sort of curved. If you measure from the bottom, it's not necessarily where the lowest point of that pipe is going to be. The lowest point is actually going to be sitting somewhere here. You could be real fancy and cut it angled if you want, but it really doesn't matter. It's going to be supported only at this point so you do want to measure from the bottom of the pipe, not from the top of the filter. Measure from the bottom of the pipe going on up to this point. For me, you definitely don't want to cut higher than 3.25. The measurement you're looking at is 3.25 for the back piece. In terms of the front piece, it'll be higher than 3.25 because again, that part sort of there's a decline to it. You just stick the other pipe in there and basically what I did was I had the other pipe, which was a whole pipe, stuck it all the way in and then you just this one will actually have to sit about maybe 3-4mm in front of the other one just so that the ridges line up with one another. Set it in so it's comfortable and that it's resting on the decline portion here so it's not going anywhere. That's where it's steady and then draw the line and make sure you cut underneath that line so that you still ensure that seal around here. If these aren't even, it's really not a big deal. You don't have to be very exact because you still have other pipes that are going to sit on top of it later. You'll get your cut length on this one. This one for me was probably around 3.75mm but again, measure yours first. Basically you're just cutting out little stilts just to hold it in place so the air can pass through it but doesn't impede the flow to the pipe that you had already placed in there the first time. This is what I used, the big gap filler this is from Home Depot as well and so you screw on the pipe up there If you have a couple of rooms that you want to do it's advisable to work your way up to this point first because this big gap filler if you let it sit for too long it hardens and usually doesn't allow use over multiple times because everything just dries up here. At this point you've inserted everything in and you have the pipe inserted as well just the back pipe is what we'll start off with and then what you want to do is basically fill exactly where I had filled before. This comes out pretty fast and expands quite a bit so you don't have to lay down too much so fill this gap here that gap back there should be filled too and then fill up this whole gap and that gap down there and once you have that in place you can slide your other piece here and insert it in there and at that point push it down a little bit and you can actually seal off the outer edges there too and you might as well seal off the rest of the edges here too that way it ensures a complete seal Alright so everything is placed in there and it's secured and it's sealed off one thing you can also do is to cut out a second a second cover up sheet from that template so ideally if you had it in black it would be great I had paper lying around so I had a heavier paper stock of white so I cut it out and you just lay it over it doesn't have to sit completely flat for the most part because when you put the grow back on it will obscure the vast majority of all this you just want to cover up some of the ugly cut marks that you had made or if you were neater it might look cleaner than mine but it's not visible from the patient's perspective and we have cut the larger hole by now and you insert it right back over it's going to be a little snug and just make sure everything clips back into place especially these have to definitely go in first so make sure it's almost like a finger in order to to lock in properly there just push it on down and then you just place the front plate back on and screw in those six screws actually before you do the six screws make sure you have the two phillips here and then screw in the six now for reassembly again it's critical to make sure these little nibs go in first so you have the piece of plastic on the inside of the unit and this little wing here it's like a little fork so it does have to insert before the rest of it allows you to click it in place so it's all clipped in there same on the other side then insert all the screws and you're pretty much done with this part at least one other thing that has to be done as well is that the return vents in the rooms have to be closed off so you do have to cover them off otherwise the negative pressure system will just draw air from the return vents so seal them off just like I did for the ceiling tile here and here's the final piece here and so you do have two separate downspouts that sit on top of the ones that we were modifying here and each pipe is individually wrapped with that aluminum duct tape and then I just had one more wrapped around both of them just for aesthetic purposes so you can see they both exhaust up through the ceiling tiles here into the interstitial space and at this point the room is fairly sealed from the interstitial space and you should seal up any other ports behind the walls for me I have video cables running through the walls so all those ports are sealed up so you don't get any air leakage otherwise I think this will keep you as healthy as possible ideally you do want to set this up somewhere between the door and this vent but for most of us optometrists usually right behind the patient is some sort of visual acuity mirror so it doesn't quite work out that way plus the patient has to recline so for me off and to the side worked out a little better so if they're always in constant air flow in the path of air flow then it would work better now verify the negative pressure with a digital pressure gauge or analog it should read negative .01 inches water column do note my tubes are reversed so the reading is positive so good luck and if you have any questions post them down in the comments below and if you find this helpful at all for you then please subscribe and like the video too Thank you for watching\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV_lqzoUekI', 'chunk': 0}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, I'm really excited to be able to see your faces again. It's about time to come out of hibernation and we've developed some COVID-19 protocols to make sure that we're being as safe and as healthy as possible for all of the Sierra Madre residents on the surrounding cities. And so I'd like to share some of those ideas with you today. Now those protocols will start even before you come into the office. And so we always have online scheduling that we can assist you with that through text message, emails, phone calls, and we also have required online forms. So when you fill out your forms online, it allows us to spend more direct time with you throughout the whole exam. When you get to the office, we can jump right into the exam instead of waiting for paperwork to be filled out. And three, it minimizes touch points. Now when you get into the office, there's a few things we have to do before you're allowed entry. And the first is that we'll have a COVID questionnaire to make sure that you're feeling healthy and others around you are also still feeling healthy at home. And two, we'll take your temperature with a non-contact thermometer. And three, we'll ensure that you're wearing a mask and we'll also provide hand sanitizer so when you come in, your hands are perfectly clean too. And at that point, we'll jump right into the exam, but the exam does split into two parts. The first part is the case history. Normally I'd spend face-to-face time with a patient during that time, but since we're trying to minimize face-to-face time, that'll be in a different room and it'll be done through a web communication. So I'll be able to see your face, you'll be able to see mine. We'll just talk remotely. And then the second part of the exam resumes as normal. We move into a different room, so we have fresh air. And in that room is when I walk in and I'll check your eyes, I'll make sure you're seeing clearly, wrap up any other concerns, and then our opticians will take you out to the front if you need glasses. And there, they have face shields and they'll be masked as well and all of our instruments have shields built into them to protect my employees and yourself. If you need contacts, everything will just be shipped to you directly. And after you leave, we'll spend about 10 to 15 minutes at disinfect everything. It gives us ample time to clean things and also gives ample time for any aerosolized viral particles to settle. We hope that there won't be any viral particles, but just in case we will have the time for them to settle and the air will be cleaned. We're going to utilize chemical disinfection, UVC, ozone, and have the filtration as well. So we're doing the best that we can to keep everyone safe and healthy. Now, if you have any other suggestions, please share them with us. We're glad to take them in and to integrate them into our systems. And I hope to see you guys really soon. And until then, take care.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6VgVfYl9R0', 'chunk': 0}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey guys! So good morning. Buenos dias. So we woke up early-ish to come back to Isaac's eye doctor because he has another appointment. And if you guys remember we talked about how Isaac has these CRT lenses that are kind of like retainers for your eyeballs so he doesn't have to wear any sort of like eye correctiveness throughout the day. So no contacts, no glasses. And a lot of you guys were actually curious and wanted to learn more about what CRT lenses are because like me in the past, you guys have never heard about these lenses. So we're actually going to be talking to Isaac's eye doctor about them and learning more about what CRT lenses are all about. And also hear from Isaac and see what his experience with them have been. He's still waking up so excuse Isaac for a little bit. You still have your bed head going on. Yeah. Hi doctor! Hello, hey Isaac. How are you? You ready to get those lenses checked? Yeah. Yeah. Alright so this is Dr. Eric Toh here at Lumen Optometric and he's going to be talking to us about this boy's lenses right here. Did it bring out? Yep. Nice. Alright so we got the lenses and we're going to get educated. So this is optically how corneal reshaping or ortho-K lenses work compared to standard lenses. So when we focus here and when I draw this shape, think of this as the cornea. This is the clear window of your eye looking straight up towards the ceiling here. And so when you wear, let's say normal contacts, normal contacts just drape over the eye. They're soft and there's really no, they just conform to the eye essentially. Now when it's corneal reshaping or ortho-K lenses, the lenses have a more unique shape. And so I call it a volcanic shape here. And so you'll see these two humps in this specific area. And so when you sleep in this lens, what happens is that there's a force, there's a negative pressure force. So it's actually a pull force. So it pulls in this direction and it pulls in this direction here. There's no pushing. When you have a lens that pushes, it's unhealthy and some patients do have issues, which we'll talk about later. But when you have a properly designed lens, it's always negative pressure. There's never any push. And so what happens, what's unique about how this works is that in terms of the cornea, the cells will actually migrate to the area of pull and they'll migrate to this area and they'll migrate to this region as well. And then what happens is, is that there's a resultant change in the shape of the cornea. So the cornea actually takes on this slightly volcanic shape as well. So it's a little bit thicker in this region and it's a little bit thicker in this region. And for all of the patients, like for Isaac too, Isaac was myopic, otherwise known as nearsighted. And if any of you folks watching the video are myopic or nearsighted, if you touch your lenses, your glasses lenses, you'll notice it's thicker at the edges compared to the center. And so the way we always designate lenses for patients who are myopic is, it looks like this. It's sort of like a sideways hourglass. But you can tell it's thicker on the edge here and thicker here. And optically, that's how it cancels out the prescription. So essentially what we're doing is we're building that correction into the eye. That's what allows Isaac to see clear every morning once he takes the lenses out and he sees clear for the rest of the day. Yeah. So I actually had a DM from one of you guys asking me whether or not Dr. Toe has discussed with us the negative side effects that could potentially happen. Because there was someone in my DMs who told me about her experience, how she had CRT lenses growing up throughout her childhood. But then when she entered her adulthood, she was notified that those lenses ended up like eating down her cornea. So she ended up having a negative experience with CRT lenses. So what are some thoughts that you might have as to why that might have happened to her? And is this an actual effect that can happen to anyone? Like to Isaac, for example? Like will we find out later when he's an adult that his cornea is depleted? When it comes to this question, it goes back to how you design the lenses with the software and also how you monitor your patients as well. So if we go back to a really quick whiteboard, when you consider how the lenses are shaped again, right? So really exaggerated here. Again, you're creating negative pressure here and negative pressure here. And the cornea pretty much sits right underneath it. The thing is, is that these lenses, there's always a cushion of tears. Okay, there's never a point where the lens or there's never a point where the lens is supposed to actually touch the eye. Because if the back surface of that lens touches the front surface of your cornea, you'll definitely have an abrasion. And so most likely that's probably what happened. For some of our patients, we always, or for all of our patients, we always monitor how their eyes are doing by looking in. And I have Isaac come back quarterly to make sure everything's healthy. I think even for Tiffany, she didn't, she wasn't aware of OrthoK CRT until somebody else had told her about it. And so a lot of patients aren't aware of it. And there's a lot of potential for keeping eyes healthy with it. I mean, this isn't the only way to keep eyes healthy. Whenever we have a patient, we always fight to make sure that they're healthy and that they love the experience because most parents don't know. And so when somebody performs OrthoK improperly, then that type of news spreads. And it does, it does kids, kids like Isaac a disservice. It does future kids whose parents who find that one, I mean, for every thousand kids who are happy, there might be one child who saw a provider that wasn't taking very good care. And, and the news of that one tends to spread like wildfire. Yeah. And so, um, I always fight to make sure our kids are, are taking, have their eyes well taken care of so that their, their eyes are healthy and that future kids don't, don't find this, this, this news and their parents don't tend to ruminate on it. Yeah, that's true. Because we actually heard from Isaac's dentist about his daughter doing CRT lenses. And we were like, what is this? Cause Isaac had already been tired of using contact or no, not contacts. He had been tired of using glasses. He was interested in getting contacts. But then once his dentist brought this up, we were like, Oh, that sounds way better. You have to wear contacts throughout the days, only at night. We started treatment back in April. So it's already been more than a whole year that you've been doing this. Honestly, it feels nice. I remember when I was little and I had clear vision. I remember one day I looked into the projector at school. And that's when it started getting blurry. It's pretty nice to have that same experience, but older and getting to see a road name from far away without wearing anything on my face. Yeah. But like when you were really little and you had clear vision, huh? Yeah. So it's really nice. The lenses I have now is very comfortable. That you have now, the lenses that you have now are very comfortable. Because I can't really feel them sometimes. So yeah, it's like my regular eye. I know in the beginning when we first started this treatment, you were having some issues with the comfortableness, comfortability of your lenses. Yeah, comfort. Yeah. Yeah, I think for Isaac, I mean, you were seeing clear even though it was a little uncomfortable in the beginning, though, from what I recall. And so optically, he was well protected. But some of our patients, their eyes are a little more sensitive. So I just have to alter the fit. I mean, when you're taking a custom scan, you're taking a custom scan of essentially, it's a soft, soft tissue. Yeah. And so there's assumptions that are made there. And for some patients, the assumptions are really spot on. Sometimes they're a little bit more off, they're a little off. And so we just have to accommodate for it. And so once once we're aware of the issue, then we correct it. And now we're good. Yeah. And another thing that really sold me for CRT lenses was when we first came in, Dr. To is telling us about how over time, that these types of lenses end up maintaining the health of Isaac's eyeballs over time, your eyes end up getting elongated, because those lenses are over correcting your eyes. So which means like, throughout time, your vision is technically getting worse, right? Normally, yeah, normally, normally, if we hadn't done anything, and if Isaac were just continue with normal glasses or contacts, his eyes would have kept growing. Yeah. And every time it's it grows, it actually gets less healthy. Yeah, because the there's the there's a light, think of the eye as a camera, there's essentially, it's almost like film on the inside, it's the retina. And that is the same size as your eyes growing. The problem is, as your eye grows, that retina has to stretch. And so it doesn't like being stretched. Alright, so we got to learn a lot from Dr. To about CRT lenses, and myopia management. And if you guys are interested in checking out Dr. To, you can check out the website down in the description below lumenoptometric.com. And if you're not local to LA, you can also check out his website. And then there's also references or resources there where you guys can find an eye doctor closest to you. So thank you so much, Dr. To for having us appreciate the educational lesson. And we'll be coming back for Isaac's checkups. All right, now we're gonna go home and play some video games. Yeah, right. Spend some time outside, right? Rest those eyes. We'll ride on my ripstick. Yeah, we'll ride on his ripstick. He tried teaching me the other day and it was a fail. But you can try teaching me again. Yeah. Maybe. I could ride to the mailbox. Yes. Yeah, away from video games, right? That's right. Yeah, yeah. More time outside, less time indoors. More on this ripstick thing.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGENWFm5M5s', 'chunk': 0}),\n",

I love the fact that I could see it was great that I didn't have to worry about getting my glasses to go to school I'm a very forgetful person. So I just forget my glasses and then I can't see for class No, so it's great being able to just wake up and go about my day And then what about the benefits or what can you do now that you couldn't do before or was more difficult for you to do Before it was definitely more difficult for me to play sports, you know wearing glasses while playing volleyball is not ideal I think it's smacked in the face So it was very nice to not have to worry about that for studying and worry about headaches wearing glasses Staring at my computer for however long baking even so my glasses don't fall into the batter. That's great Yeah Yeah, that's wonderful You think about the the other benefit to the one of the really important benefits is the the fact that your prescription hasn't changed much since we've met and It's stable your eyes in a much healthier place So for for our parents or for our other potential young patients who are thinking about CRT What do you think thumbs up or thumbs down? Oh thumbs up a hundred percent You're great, you know educating patients about like what our eyes function and all that good stuff So I know how my eyes are changing or not changing and it's great.

She's been willing to help us out with this video testimonial of her SLARO lenses. So Cindy, when you first came in, what was going on with your current contacts and your issues that you're experiencing? Well, I had ongoing issues with my rigid cast permeable lenses, fogging up, just not clear, needing to take them out several times a day to clean them, to try to see better and I thought, gee, got to do something about this. So I called up the practice and was told that I probably would be a good candidate to look into the SLARO lenses and so I did. Oh, that's great. I remember when you first came in, you had mentioned that you were cleaning them, I think you had almost mentioned once every like 15, 20 minutes or something like that. Yes. Yeah. So it was impacting my lifestyle. I mean, I was nervous to go out because I was always afraid the lenses would fog up while I was driving and having to carry cleaning solution, take them out of public restrooms, clean them, all of that. So, yeah. Super, super comfortable. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So at this point, Cindy's wearing the S-MAP created lenses and so the S-MAP creates a custom scan of the whole frontal aspect of the eye and we create a SLARO lens off of that and I coin these as SLARO 2.0 lenses. So how do they feel? They feel wonderful. I don't even realize they're on my eye. Very, very comfortable. Yeah. It's good to know. And then your prescription is extremely high, so what would you say in terms of stability of your vision? Does it fluctuate like it did with gas permeable lenses? Oh, very stable. So much better. Just put them in in the morning and they stay in all day. Last thing to come out at night and it's been fabulous. Just to kind of get my life back to know I could see clearly all day. All right. Well, I'm glad they're working out for you. Yeah. All right. So we want to thank Cindy for helping us out with the video today. So thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Okay.

       " Document(page_content=\"We have Nikki here, and Nikki's helping us with an Ortho-K testimonial. And so, the first question I always ask, what was your vision like before Ortho-K? Before Ortho-K, I used regular soft-faced lenses or just daily lenses that I used to wear. They were extremely dry. I used to just have different eyedrops with me no matter where I went. Whether I was working long shifts at my work or if I was in a room where the fan or the air conditioning was on me, they would constantly dry out to the point where I was blinking and they would just fall out. So, eyedrops were essential and it just became tedious and it just became uncomfortable. So, coming here and finding a whole new, brand new type of solution was extremely nice. And I'm extremely grateful for Dr. To and everything that he's done for me. So, before, do not recommend this new method. I highly recommend and I'm so happy that I made the change. Glad. Yeah, I know with dry eyes, it's definitely not comfortable, especially when it comes to soft contacts. So, what's your vision like now? My vision now is absolutely amazing. I'm really obsessed with it and extremely grateful for everything that the doctor and this business has done for me and that these new contacts have done for me. My vision now, I feel like I'm looking in HD. I'm viewing in 4K. I don't have any blurriness. I wear them for one night when I wake up and I can see everything. I'm usually nearsighted. So, like before I had problems seeing faces far away, reading signs far away. So, driving is fantastic now, like recognizing faces and seeing people, going to work, being able to view and see everything in clear, perfect vision is so nice and I really love it. Yeah, it was exciting for you, especially that day when you came in for the dispense and we placed it in your eye and then by the time we took it off, it wasn't even on for that long. Yes, yeah. When we tried on the lens, we did a couple of tests for like a couple of minutes and then I took them off and I only put them on for like 10 minutes and I was able to see it already. I was so excited to be able to sleep in them and then be able to live my life and live my entire day after all of that. So, very seamless process and yeah, dry eyes are not a problem anymore. I don't have to carry on my liquid eye drops or anything. So, very happy and I just feel like a normal person that can wake up and start my day and not have to worry about one more thing that I have to do. That's wonderful. How about the whole process? Do you feel like we held your hand through the whole thing, that we taught you everything you needed to know? Yeah, coming into this office, a couple of things like setting an appointment is extremely easy. Coming in, they make time for each individual patient. So, when you're here, their full attention is on you. You don't have to wait in a waiting room for 15, 20, 30 minutes. When it's your appointment time, they make that time just for you because they space them out. They give you their full attention. They're really good with doing recurrent and bringing you back every couple of weeks, every two weeks, checking in on you. Additionally, Dr. To will always text you and ask you how you're doing. He'll send you emails regularly. He's very hands-on, makes you very comfortable and really great experience here. I'm really glad that I found this place. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you for my great vision. Oh, you're welcome. Yeah, we love taking care of you and your family too and Nikki's mom wears Ortho-K too. Yes, my mom first came here, lived super close, was looking for a new eye doctor. Not only did we find a great eye doctor, but we found new types of lenses that have changed our whole families like my mom's. It also means I'm really glad that my mom found the space and then recommended me as a family member. Thank you so much for your testimony. It really means a lot. We love seeing you here. We love seeing you every single time you come in. And so it really means a lot that they trust us with your vision care. Thank you.

I would tear up quite often, very itchy, and I was constantly conscious that I needed to rub them because they were either too dry or itchy. And then also, in terms of how your head felt, do you remember where most of your headaches would occur? Yes, I would get headaches several times during the week, starting from the temple and sometimes going to the back of my neck. So you're definitely on the computer quite a bit, huh? Yes, from very early hours in the morning at work and then still come home and be on my computer to take care of things at home too. I know what that feels like. That's very painful all day long.

I feel that I don't have that much strain in my eyes. So I'm not as tired when I get home and still have to be on the computer for another couple of hours. So I really am loving my glasses. I'm glad.

And so, two years later, here we are. Yeah. So, do you remember the very first night when you woke up after having slept in the lenses? What was your vision like? Yeah. It was good, and then I forgot that I, like, it felt like I had glasses on, and I forgot about it. And I kept, like, trying to touch my face, but they weren't there. Yeah. It's such an interesting experience when you wake up and you're used to seeing blurry until you find your glasses. Yeah. Now you just wake up and you see clear, right? Yeah. You play a lot of sports, and you're in good shape, right? Yeah. When I was playing soccer, my, like, my goggles would get in the way, and, like, say the ball hit me, it would hurt.

And so the first thing I'd like to ask is how was your vision before you started? It's been pretty well. I've seen really clear than I have ever been before. Gotcha. What about you? Yeah, before my vision was super, super bad, especially growing up with astigmatism. It was always a challenge and I've always had glasses since I can remember. So now it's a very new experience, but it's a good progression that I'm excited to see, that I can just see in general, and that I don't have to use glasses no longer. Yeah, it's nice though. I know a lot of folks who have clear vision sort of take it for granted, but I mean, both of you have fairly high prescription. So going from so blurry, being able now to see 20-20 is a pretty big difference when you wake up, right? You don't have to retrace your glasses anymore. Yeah, yeah. So I'm glad. Perfect. And then what I'd like to ask the parents too, from your perspective, do you feel as if we took good care of your children to make sure that they were seen clear and their eyes were healthy? Definitely. It was very exciting for me to know about the way how they can progress their vision. And once we started with my son and then later on with Sahara, I can see in both of them the progress and the hassle not to be looking for glasses and spending so much in frames and all this stuff. So it is a very, very good system in how to correct the vision. It's very exciting to see how this fast they were able to get rid of the glasses. Yeah, that's great. And then any tips for any future parents looking into myopia management? I will say they should search for this option instead of having the glasses, especially when the kids are very active, like Hector, he was very active. It was very a hassle to see how to help him not to fall with his glasses on and stuff like that. So I will say I would recommend to the parents definitely to go by this option. It's way better than the lenses. Yeah, I'm glad you're doing well. Again, the girls are a family that we see fairly regularly. It's always nice to see your faces in here. Yeah. All right.

Before I had scleral lenses, um, I had, I had gas permeable lenses and they were so uncomfortable and it always felt like I had glass in my eyes. It felt like, um, my eyes were super dry all the time. I travel often, so I needed something that was comfortable and that I was able to wear for long periods of time. Due to my condition, my condition in both of my eyes, I'm not able to wear glasses and see perfectly. So it was kind of mandatory for me to have contacts in order for me to see, um, exceptionally well. Right. Um, the process itself, it was so easy and the receptionist, everyone in Lumen Optometry, they were just answering all my questions that were so, um, flexible with their schedule. As I said earlier, I travel often, so I needed something, I needed a lot of time, um, to, first of all, I live in Marina Del Rey, so I needed a lot of time, um, to get there and they were just all very flexible with, um, their schedules. The other thing I wanted to say is that, um, the scleral lenses are so comfortable. It's so comfortable. Like, you don't even feel that they are. And I was really afraid because of the size of the scleral lenses, I never had anything, you know, that big, um, you know, in my eyes, so I wanted to make sure that it was, um, that it was going to be comfortable and it was. And Dr. Tove, um, definitely made sure that it was before I went home. Um, he, he, him and his receptionist made sure that I knew how to take off the lenses because it's a completely different process, um, than the gas permeable lenses that I had before and they made sure that I knew how to put them on by myself before I went home. So that process itself was, um, very thorough and I appreciate that they could, they were concerned about my health when it comes to that. Um, other than that, like I had an overall great experience. I recommend it to anyone moving forward. I definitely recommend it to my friends and family. Um, they were so easy to work with and they were really, really so happy to answer any of my questions.
