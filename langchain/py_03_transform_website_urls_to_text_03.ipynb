Given its complexity, it’s essential\\nto understand the facts about the condition rather than believing the common\\nmyths often shared online or by friends and family. Knowing more about AMD can\\nhelp you take steps to prevent or delay its progression, so here are\\nstatements you can overlook to maintain your vision for years to come. Myth\\n#1: AMD Is a Disease That Only Affects Older Adults AMD is an eye condition\\ncaused by deterioration in part of the retina, called the macula. This area at\\nthe back of your eye helps you see things with sharp detail and color when\\nlooking straight ahead—for example, when reading or driving a car—but it does\\nnot affect peripheral vision like looking out into the distance around you.\\nWhile researchers are still working to understand what causes this macular\\ndegeneration, it’s likely due to age combined with other risk factors such as\\nsmoking, obesity and genetics. Who is at risk of AMD? People over age 50 have\\nan increased risk of developing early stages of this condition; however,\\nyounger people may also be diagnosed if they have certain genetic mutations\\nassociated with these conditions. Myth #2: There Is No Cure for AMD Though\\nthere currently isn’t a cure for late-stage AMD, treatments are available\\ndepending on which type has been diagnosed. Dry AMD has no treatment yet, but\\nrecent studies indicate that some dietary changes may slow its progression.\\nLifestyle changes that can help include eating leafy green vegetables rich in\\nlutein and zeaxanthin, as well as omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil might\\nreduce inflammation throughout your body, including within your eyes.\\nSimilarly, maintaining good overall health by exercising regularly, eating\\nhealthy foods, quitting smoking and protecting yourself from UV light will\\nhelp lower ocular inflammation. Myth #3 All Vision Loss From MDM Is\\nIrreversible Treatments such as intravitreal injections of anti-vascular\\nendothelial growth factor medications and photodynamic therapy can help\\nimprove vision in some cases. Other treatments such as laser therapy,\\nvitrectomy, cataract surgery and low vision aids can also help reduce AMD’s\\neffects. Early diagnosis and management are key to preserving your sight\\nlonger with AMD. Time to Get Checked If you are over 50 or have any other risk\\nfactors for developing AMD, you should get an eye exam with your doctor.

That’s\\nwhy millions of people wear these lenses for several hours on a daily basis.\\nHowever, despite being a common device used to correct vision, it’s not\\nunusual for some contact lens wearers to forget a thing or two about contact\\nlens safety. Generally, contact lenses are safe when they are worn responsibly\\nand cared for properly. Whether you are new to wearing contacts or you have\\nbeen a long-time contact lens wearer, make sure that you follow these 10\\nimportant rules listed by neurons treatment expert Lumen Optometric. Don’t\\nsleep in your contact lenses. Closing your eyes while wearing your lenses\\nreduces oxygen and makes the surface of your eye more vulnerable to\\ninfection.Don’t wear your contacts when you are in the shower, swimming pool,\\nocean, or hot tub. Tap water, seawater, and the water from lakes, rivers, and\\npools harbor organisms that can cause an eye infection.Have your contact\\nlenses fitted by a qualified eye care professional. And make sure to follow\\ntheir instruction on when to replace your contacts. Using lenses for longer\\nthan the manufacturer’s recommendation will increase your risk for eye\\ninfection as protein buildup could occur. If you are also using dry eye\\ntreatment, ask your doctor about precautions on wearing contacts, if\\nany.Always use fresh contact lens solutions every time you store your contact\\nlenses in their case. Never reuse solution or top off old solution since the\\ndisinfecting ability of the old solution is already gone.Never use saline\\nwater for disinfecting or cleaning your contact lenses. Saline solution is\\njust sterile saltwater, so it has no ability to clean or disinfect\\ncontacts.Wash your hands with soap and water before touching your contact\\nlenses. Make sure to completely rinse and dry your hands.Clean your contact\\nlens case using a multipurpose contact lens solution. Let it dry during the\\nday and make sure to replace it every month.Check your contact lenses for\\ntears or chips. Although these lenses are soft, a tear or a chip can still\\nscratch your eye. It’s best to discard your lenses if they have been\\ndamaged.Discard your lenses if they land on the floor or in the sink.If you\\nare using reusable lenses, make sure to rub the lenses with a multipurpose\\ncontact lens solution. This will help remove debris or protein buildup. Lumen\\nOptometric Need to consult a scleral optometrist? Visit Lumen Optometric to\\nget excellent and personalized eye care services.

The obvious\\nbenefits of fresh air and physical exercise aren’t the only perks for kids who\\nplay outdoors. Recent research shows that increased “sun time” can actually\\nslow down the progression of myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), or\\neven postpone its onset! But First, What Is Myopia and Why Is It Harmful?\\nMyopia is an eye disease that causes the eye to elongate more than it should,\\nresulting in blurry distance vision. It’s caused by a combination of genetic\\nand environmental factors, two of which are not spending enough time outdoors\\nand doing excessive near work like device use. Many parents aren’t aware that\\nchildhood myopia significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye\\ndiseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular\\ndegeneration later in life. It’s been shown that higher myopia is associated\\nwith a greater risk of eye disease. That’s why it’s important to stop myopia\\nin its tracks with myopia management. 3 Reasons Why Outdoor Play Benefits Your\\nChild’s Eyes Whether your child is currently nearsighted or not, spending time\\noutdoors in the sunshine can help delay the onset of myopia or slow its\\nprogression. 1\\\\. The Brightness of the Sun The sun’s visible light is\\nsignificantly brighter than the lighting in almost any indoor setting, which\\nmay play a major role in controlling myopia. Studies have shown that when\\nsunlight comes in contact with the retina, it causes the release of dopamine\\ninto the eye. This may prevent the eye from elongating. Preventing the eye\\nfrom growing too long is the main goal of myopia management. What is certain:\\nchildren who spend at least 2-3 hours playing outdoors in the sunshine\\nprogress less rapidly than children who spend almost all their time indoors.\\n2\\\\. Long-Distance Focusing It is well established that prolonged near\\nactivities like reading and screen time contribute to myopia onset and\\nprogression. It’s no surprise that studies now show COVID-19 confinement may\\nhave caused higher rates of myopia in children as well. Spending time\\noutdoors, on the other hand, encourages your child to focus on distant objects\\nlike trees, basketball hoops, a ball flying through the air— anything that’s\\nmore than an arm’s length away. 3\\\\. Vitamin D Vitamin D helps smooth muscle\\ntissue around the eye’s crystalline lens allowing it to function properly.\\nThis smooth muscle helps focus light on the retina, and may also help maintain\\nthe proper eye shape and length between the lens and the retina, which can\\nbecome distorted as a child’s eyes grow with every passing year. Moreover, the\\nsun’s invisible UVB light triggers Vitamin D production. Some studies have\\nfound that nearsighted individuals have lower levels of Vitamin D than those\\nwith normal vision. However, more research is needed to solidify this claim,\\nas only small-scale studies have been performed. The recommended time for\\ndaily outdoor play is at least 2 hours for children over the age of 6. Be sure\\nto send your child outside with a water bottle, sun hat, sunglasses, and\\nsunscreen. At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to battle childhood myopia and\\npreserve children’s eye health for the long term. We encourage parents to\\nlearn more about myopia and check out real stories from satisfied parents and\\nchildren sharing their experiences with our professional doctors, staff, and\\nmyopia treatment protocols at Treehouse Eyes.

The more you know about\\nworkplace eye safety, the better you can protect your eyes and the longer you\\ncan enjoy clearer and healthier vision. Lumen Optometric, the area’s leading\\nspecialist in corneal reshaping and other eye care services, shares some of\\nthe things you can do to protect your eyes in the workplace. 1\\\\. Wear the\\nnecessary eye protection. Those whose career is in construction work,\\nengineering and landscaping tend to be more at risk of eye-related injuries.\\nIf you belong to any of these fields, make sure that you always wear the\\napplicable eye protection. Doing so not only keeps you safe but also ensures\\nyou’ll be able to carry out your tasks in a more efficient manner. 2\\\\. Reduce\\nexposure to blue light. People working in construction, engineering, and other\\nphysically demanding jobs run the risk of developing eye problems, but this\\ndoesn’t mean those working in the office aren’t exempt. Staring in front of a\\ncomputer screen can make office employees more prone to digital eye strain.\\nIts symptoms may include headaches, fatigue, dry and watery eyes, and blurred\\nvision.

By limiting your child’s screen time,\\nyou help your child to experience the many benefits. As a parent, you should\\nbe mindful of how much time your child spends on devices. You might be\\nwondering, how can a parent help in preventing eye diseases in their children?\\nWell, it all starts with limiting screen time. Here are several ways for you\\nto do just that. Set Expectations The first step to limiting your child’s\\nscreen time is to let them know what you expect. Set clear expectations early\\non, explaining why you are limiting their screen time and why it’s important\\nfor them to spend more time playing outside or reading books. If they have\\nconcerns or questions about limiting their screen time, listen and address\\nthem before setting the limit so that they understand why it is important to\\nfollow these rules. You can even make a deal with your child: if they spend 30\\nminutes doing something other than using screens, then they can watch TV or\\nplay video games for 30 minutes afterward (or whatever works best). However,\\ndon’t give in to demands—be consistent! Set a Timer Setting a timer is an\\neffective way to limit your child’s screen time. Not only will it remind them\\nwhen their allotted time is up, but it can also help them keep track of how\\nmuch time they’ve spent on various activities as well. You can choose from\\nseveral apps that are available for download onto your smartphone; or if you\\nprefer, there are physical timers out there as well (like ones with bells). If\\nusing an app, simply select the length of time that you want your child to\\nspend looking at screens and set the alarm accordingly. Once this is done, you\\ncan set up notifications to alert you every hour so that if anything goes\\nwrong—or if any inappropriate material is being viewed—you’ll know about it\\nright away. Create a “Tech-Free” Zone in Your Home You can create a “tech-\\nfree” zone in your home by choosing a room or space that is free of all\\nscreens and then putting them there. This could be your child’s bedroom, or it\\ncould be a quiet spot in the house where you can enjoy each other’s company\\nwithout distractions. This will allow everyone to relax and disconnect from\\ntechnology while they’re at home, which may help prevent screen time overload\\nand overstimulation when using technology later on. Lead by Example The most\\neffective way to control your child’s screen time is by monitoring your own\\nusage as well. While it is important to set limits for your child, you need to\\nbe aware of how much time you are spending in front of a screen as well.\\nChildren will often mimic their parents, so if you want them to cut back on\\ntheir own screen time, then it’s best for parents to do the same thing first.\\nChoose Treehouse Eyes For Better Vision It’s important for your child to\\ndevelop social skills and human interaction. You can’t do this if they’re\\nglued to their screens. It also helps them learn how to manage their\\ndistractions, which is an important life skill that will help them get through\\nthings like school and work.

To ensure\\nthat your child can do well in class, you will need to manage their refractive\\nerror. This usually means going to a trusted local eye doctor for prescription\\neyeglasses. But not every child wants to wear eyeglasses, especially those who\\nare active in sports and other physical activities. This makes contact lenses\\na more attractive option, but is your child actually ready for them? Lumen\\nOptometric, the leading eyecare provider in the area, shares how you can know.\\n1\\\\. Your child is asking if they can wear them. The decision to wear contact\\nlenses will depend on the child. If wearing eyeglasses makes them unhappy and\\nuncomfortable, then they will be far more motivated to take good care of their\\ncontact lenses. 2\\\\. They make an effort to be clean and hygienic. Proper use\\nand care of contact lenses is a big responsibility. Cleanliness should always\\nbe observed to ensure safety and comfort and to prevent infections and other\\neye problems. If your child knows the importance of cleanliness and makes an\\neffort to practice good hygiene, then they should be ready to wear contacts.\\n3\\\\. Your child does their chores without being asked repeatedly. A certain\\namount of discipline is required on the part of the child when it comes to\\ncontact lens use. The proper cleaning and storage of contact lenses are akin\\nto doing household chores. When they don’t need to be told twice about what\\nneeds to be done, then they’re already a good candidate for contact lenses.\\n4\\\\. They are active in sports. Eyeglasses get in the way of your child’s\\nathletic interests. By letting them wear contacts, they can maximize their\\npotential in sports, allowing them to perform well while enjoying clearer\\nvision.

One of these problems is diabetic\\neye disease, which can severely damage your vision. Diabetic retinopathy,\\ndiabetic macular edema, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the conditions that\\nresult from this disease. Fortunately, Lumen Optometric is here to share four\\nsteps you can take to prevent or slow down diabetic eye disease. 1\\\\. Undergo a\\nDilated Eye Exam Annually Diabetic patients are highly advised to visit a\\ndilated eye exam doctor at least once a year. In this assessment, your\\nophthalmologist will identify early signs that diabetes is affecting your\\neyesight. Typically, diabetic eye diseases only show a few symptoms until the\\ncondition has advanced. If your vision starts to blur due to diabetes, consult\\na professional immediately to determine the best treatment for you and save\\nyou from irreversible vision loss. 2\\\\. Manage Your Blood Sugar Keep your blood\\nsugar level in your target range by eating food that is low in sugar and\\ncarbohydrates, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood sugar. For\\npersonalized assistance, consult a primary care physician, an endocrinologist\\nor a nutritionist. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor. 3\\\\. Control\\nYour Blood Pressure Managing blood pressure can protect your eyes from\\ndiabetic retinopathy, which is a complication of diabetes that damages the\\nretina. If your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are high, your tiny\\nfragile blood vessels would react negatively, resulting in serious eye damage.\\nIn the event that your eye condition has worsened, call your eye doctor right\\naway for corneal reshaping or other treatments. 4\\\\. Maintain an Active and\\nHealthy Lifestyle A balanced diet and regular exercise can help control your\\ndiabetes, which can benefit your eye health. As much as possible, avoid\\nconsuming processed and fried food, an excessive amount of red meat, high-\\nsugar beverages, and food with refined carbohydrates. For a hassle-free\\nmealtime, you can ask your diabetic care team to create a meal plan that works\\nfor you and provides you with enough energy to maintain an active lifestyle.\\nFor outstanding diabetic eye care, you can rely on us at Lumen Optometric. We\\nprovide comprehensive eye examinations, contact lenses and other optical\\nsolutions. Schedule an eye consultation by calling us at (626) 921-0199 or\\ncompleting our online form.

Besides giving you the ability to see, they\\nlet you learn new skills and interact with others. Taking good care of your\\neyes goes a long way in maintaining good vision and avoiding sight-threatening\\nconditions. A local orthokeratology specialist gives five tips to keep your\\neyes healthy. 1\\\\. Schedule Regular Eye Exams Routine comprehensive eye exams\\nhelp diagnose various eye conditions in their early stages, including\\nglaucoma, cataracts and age-related eye conditions. Sometimes, they also allow\\nspecialists to catch signs of other health problems, such as diabetes and high\\nblood pressure. How often you need to get your eyes checked typically depends\\non your age and family history of eye disease. You may need to visit an eye\\nexam doctor more frequently if you have an existing medical condition. 2\\\\.\\nKeep Your Eye Prescription Up-to-Date Frequent headaches, constant squinting\\nand blurred vision are common signs you need to update your prescription\\neyewear. If you feel relief when you remove your glasses, it definitely means\\nyou need a new pair. Moreover, experts recommend getting new corrective\\neyeglasses every two years. 3\\\\. Protect Your Eyes From the Sun Your eyes are\\njust as susceptible to sun damage as your skin. When heading outdoors, be sure\\nto wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat is another thing\\nyou can do to protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays. 4\\\\. Maintain a\\nHealthy Diet Eating well-balanced meals will benefit your eyes and overall\\nwell-being. Incorporate foods high in zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins\\nA, C, and E into your diet. Leafy greens, nuts, fish, and colorful fruits and\\nvegetables are especially rich in these nutrients. 5\\\\. Stay Hydrated Your eyes\\ncould suffer if you don’t drink enough water. Blurred vision, eye fatigue and\\na stinging sensation in the eyes are typical signs of dehydration. Drink at\\nleast eight glasses of water daily to hydrate your eyes and body. Don’t wait\\nbefore you experience significant changes in your vision before seeing an eye\\ndoctor. Lumen Optometric is here to handle your eye care needs.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at\\nLumen Optometric share daily habits that can benefit your eyes and vision. 1\\\\.\\nWash Your Hands — Thanks to recent events, hand washing should already be part\\nof your daily routine coming from the outdoors. Even if you stay indoors most\\nof the time, you should wash your hands regularly. Common vision-related\\ndiseases like conjunctivitis (pink eye) are caused by touching in or around\\nthe eyes with unclean hands. 2\\\\. Wear Eye Protection — Whether you’re mowing\\nthe lawn, doing some woodwork in your workshop, or performing home repairs,\\ndon’t risk eye injury and always wear eye protection. Protective glasses are\\neasy to obtain, comes in many sizes, and can be worn over existing eyeglasses.\\nIf you’re working on anything that involves welding, make sure to wear a\\nwelding mask or goggles. 3\\\\. Handle Your Contact Lenses Carefully — Your\\ncontact lenses come into direct contact with your eyes; you’ll definitely want\\nto keep them clean. Always make sure that you’re handling them with clean\\nhands, keep your contact lens cases sterilized, and discard expired contact\\nlens solution. If you’re undergoing dry eye treatment, your eye doctor may\\nprescribe a different type of contact lenses, with different handling\\ninstructions. Make sure you follow them closely to avoid damage to your eyes.\\n4\\\\. Maintain a Healthy Diet — Eating fast food every day probably won’t make\\nyou go blind, but it’s not good for your health, either. Various studies have\\nshown that a diet that contains significant amounts of foods that are rich in\\nOmega-3 and lutein can help reduce the risk of cataracts, night blindness, and\\nother eye problems. 5\\\\. Rest Your Eyes — Most of us spend a significant\\nportion of the day staring at computer screens, especially those who work from\\nhome. Make sure to rest your eyes every once in a while. The “20-20-20 Rule,”\\nis a good daily practice to turn into a habit. The rule is simple: every 20\\nminutes, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Doing this\\nseveral times a day can help reduce eye strain. Lumen Optometric is your\\nleading provider of eye care services, including Neurolens® treatment. Give us\\na call at (626) 921-0199.

But how much do you really know about this\\neye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for\\ntheir child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth,\\nthere’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye.\\nBelow, we’ll explore 5 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more\\nproactive about your child’s eye health and long-term vision. 1\\\\. Myopia is an\\nEye Disease Myopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading\\nlight to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because\\nthe eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should,\\nleading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal\\neye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football.\\nBecause the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it\\nstops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood.\\nThis also means there may be times in a child’s development where they\\nexperience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an\\nincrease in their myopia. 2\\\\. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye\\ndisease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people\\nworldwide. If things don’t change, half of the world’s population will have\\nsome degree of myopia by the year 2050! 3\\\\. It’s a Progressive Condition\\nMyopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school-age\\nyears, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in\\ntandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest\\nof the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be\\ntimes in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and\\nsuddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat\\nmyopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing\\nmyopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they\\nage. 4\\\\. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease Myopic\\nchildren are significantly more likely to develop sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration,\\nand retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50%\\nhigher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop\\ncataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults\\nthan children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of\\nclear vision — a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in\\nthe Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided\\ntheir children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic\\nmaculopathy fell by 40%. 5\\\\.

In fact, there are many reasons to have them spend time outdoors, not\\nleast of which is to protect your child’s vision. Studies show that children\\nwho spend time playing outdoors in the sunshine experience less myopia\\nprogression than those who stay indoors. Moreover, encouraging more outdoor\\nplaytime is important for promoting overall health and wellbeing in your kids.\\nBelow we’ll explore some fun outdoor activity ideas to try with your kids and\\ndiscuss why spending time outdoors may slow a child’s myopia progression or\\neven postpone its onset. 5 Outdoor Activities to Do With Your Kids This Winter\\n1\\\\. Snow Play If you live in a snowy region, bundle up your kids in warm\\nlayers and have them: ● Build a snowman ● Enjoy a snowball fight ● Paint the\\nsnow with some food coloring or watercolors ● Make a snow maze ● Build an\\nigloo ● Build snow castles (the same way you would sand castles) ● Make snow\\nangels ● Collect snowflakes during a snow flurry and study their beautiful\\nshapes 2\\\\. Blow Ice Bubbles Kids love playing with and popping bubbles. If\\ntemperatures are low enough, they might freeze in mid air! They’ll get a kick\\nout of watching them freeze and possibly catching or popping them. To make\\nyour own bubble solution, mix 1 part water with 4 parts dish soap and a few\\ndrops of light corn syrup. It’s best to try this activity when winds are calm,\\nas harsh breezes can cause the bubbles to pop before they freeze. Once the\\nbubbles have landed on a surface and are completely frozen, they are beautiful\\nto photograph — which can be part 2 of this activity. 3\\\\. Go Sledding Sledding\\nis a classic winter activity that your child will love. To go sledding, all\\nyou need is snow, a sled, and a hill! Easy enough. But before you hit the\\nslopes (or hills), be sure to follow these safety guidelines: ● Choose a sled\\nthat can be steered and can brake ● Wear a helmet ● Dress warmly, but be\\ncareful as the scarf can get caught under the sled ● Children 5 years old and\\nunder should sled with an adult 4\\\\. Go on a Winter Scavenger Hunt A winter\\nscavenger hunt is a wonderful way to explore nature with all of your senses.\\nBefore you head out, make a list of things to see, smell, listen for, and\\nfeel. Ask your child to check each item off the list. For example, your list\\ncan include listening for the sounds of birds chirping, footsteps crunching in\\nthe leaves, or water babbling in a nearby stream. On the list of things to\\nlook for, you can include different types of trees, animals, animal tracks,\\ncloud shapes, birds’ nests, and more. Take your camera along and let your\\nchild take pictures of what they find. You can also leave an empty space on\\nthe list for your child to fill as they explore new things on their own. 5\\\\.\\nDecorate a Tree with Edible Ornaments For Animals This activity is an\\nunconventional twist on building a bird-feeder and perfect for those who live\\nnear a forest. The idea is to make edible ornaments and hang them on a tree\\n(or potted plant in your garden) for wildlife to feed on during the winter.\\nYour ornaments can be made using various seeds, peanut butter, dried fruit,\\nand popcorn. It’s best to use biodegradable materials to hang your ornaments,\\nand don’t use fishing lines, as birds can get caught in it. What’s the\\nConnection Between Time Outdoors and Myopia? There is increasing evidence that\\nchildren who spend extra time daily playing outdoors have a reduced risk of\\ndeveloping myopia; and if they already have myopia, time spent outdoors could\\nslow down the worsening of this condition, also known as myopia progression.\\nThese findings are significant, as having myopia significantly increases a\\nchild’s risk of developing sight-threatening eye diseases later in life.\\nModerate to high levels of myopia make a child more susceptible to developing\\ncataracts, retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and glaucoma later in\\nlife. At Treehouse Eyes, our mission is to battle childhood myopia by\\nproviding myopia management to nearsighted children. Our myopia management\\ntreatments can effectively slow down your child’s myopia progression and\\nreduce their future risk of eye disease.

This way, your trusted optometrist\\ncan detect any conditions or diseases that may trouble them later on. Which\\neye conditions are these exactly? Lumen Optometric, the trusted eye exam\\ndoctor in the area, offers a quick overview of some of them. Refractive Errors\\nThese refer to conditions that can cause blurry vision. Refractive errors\\ninclude farsightedness (hyperopia), when close objects appear distorted,\\nnearsightedness (myopia), when objects viewed at a distance are blurry and\\nastigmatism, when objects both near and far are unclear. They may occur when\\nthe cornea doesn’t bend, or refract, light properly. Symptoms include a\\ndisinterest in reading or viewing distant objects and squinting or turning the\\nhead in an odd fashion when watching television. Children diagnosed with\\nrefractive errors can be treated through prescriptive glasses, and even\\ncorneal reshaping, or orthokeratology (Ortho K). The latter refers to the use\\nof gas-permeable lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia,\\nhyperopia and refractive errors. Ortho K is a safe and effective alternative\\nto eyeglasses, refractive surgery, or contact lenses. Amblyopia Another common\\neye problem in babies and young children is amblyopia or ‘lazy eye’. This\\nhappens when the vision of one or both eyes did not develop properly during\\nchildhood, or when eye conditions, such as refractive errors, weren’t\\ncorrected promptly. Strabismus Also known as cross-eyes, strabismus is when\\nthe eyes aren’t aligned properly–instead pointing at different directions.\\nThis causes loss of depth perception because the child learns to ignore the\\nimage received by the misaligned eye, relying only on the one from the\\nstraight, or better-seeing eye. Treatment options for strabismus may include\\neyeglasses and vision therapy. Ptosis When the upper eyelid droops and\\nrestricts or blocks vision, this is called ptosis. A child with this condition\\nmay tip their head back, lift up their chin, or raise their eyebrows to try to\\nsee better, which may cause head or neck problems over time. Visit your local\\neye doctor for a thorough eye exam if your child exhibits these symptoms.\\nColor Deficiency Also called color blindness, this eye problem makes it\\ndifficult for the child to distinguish specific shades of color. This is\\nusually an inherited condition, but there are also certain diseases that can\\ncause color deficits. While there is no cure for color deficiency, there are\\nspecial glasses and contact lenses your child can wear that allow them to see\\ncolor differences.

In today’s\\npost, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at Lumen Optometric shares\\na quick guide on contact lens solutions. Multipurpose Vs. Hydrogen Peroxide\\nSolutions There are two types of contact lens solutions: multipurpose and\\nhydrogen peroxide-based. They serve the same purpose — disinfect your contacts\\nand remove debris — but they work in different ways. Multipurpose solution,\\nalso known as all-in-one solution, is simple to use. Wash your hands, put your\\ncontacts in your palm, then moisten the lenses with the multipurpose solution.\\nWhile some types of multipurpose solutions are marketed as “no rub” products,\\nexperts recommend rubbing the lenses with it for 10 seconds to remove\\nremaining debris. Apply a drop of saline solution in each lense to rinse\\nbefore wearing it. Hydrogen peroxide solution, on the other hand, requires\\nmore time or attention. Unlike multipurpose solutions, this type of contact\\nlens solution does not “spoil,” and is ideal for people who are sensitive to\\ncertain chemicals, or for those undergoing therapy like dry eye treatment.\\nHydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at disinfecting contact lenses,\\nbut it must not touch the eye directly. To use it, fill a small case with the\\nsolution (most contact lenses come with such a case) and soak them for six to\\neight hours. Before taking out the contacts, a neutralizer must be applied to\\nturn the hydrogen peroxide to a plain saline solution. Which One Should You\\nChoose? Between the two, the multipurpose solution is the more cost-effective\\nand easy-to-use, and can be used virtually anywhere as long as you have a\\ncontact lens case or a clean surface to clean them in. However, it is not as\\neffective at disinfecting contact lenses as the hydrogen peroxide solution.\\nMaking it an all-in-one solution requires certain chemicals that may not be\\nideal for some people who may be sensitive to certain substances. This also\\nmeans it has a shorter shelf life. The hydrogen peroxide solution is more\\neffective at cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses, but there is a risk of\\nharming the eye if one were to forget applying the neutralizer. It is also\\nimportant not to reuse or top off the solution after use. Contact lens cases\\nmust also be replaced every one to three months to cut the risk of infection.\\nLumen Optometric is your leading provider of eye care services, including\\nNeurolens treatment.

But apart from\\nthe style of your eyeglass frame, you should also look into the frame\\nmaterials. Lumen Optometric, a trusted scleral optometrist and eyeglass\\nprovider, discusses some of the most popular materials used for eyeglass\\nframes. Titanium Titanium is commonly used in designer glasses. It is an\\nexcellent material for eyeglass frames and hinges because it is very\\nlightweight, sturdy, hypoallergenic and corrosion-resistant. However, titanium\\nis significantly more expensive than other frame materials. Titanium alloy,\\nwhich is a combination of titanium and other metals, is typically used as a\\ncheaper alternative to titanium. Stainless Steel Stainless steel is a reliable\\nmaterial for eyeglass materials. It’s durable, strong, hypoallergenic and non-\\ncorrosive. It may not be as lightweight as other materials, but it can be\\neasily shaped into ultra-thin eyewear frames. Stainless steel is also\\nflexible, and this usually adds to the comfort of eyeglass wearers. So whether\\nyou are wearing glasses most of the time or you’re only using it temporarily\\nwhile undergoing dry eye treatment, this type of frame material can be really\\ncomfortable for you. Plastic Zyl or propionate is typically used in making the\\nplastic frame material. Zyl, which is also known as cellulose acetate, is the\\nmost common type of plastic frame material. Meanwhile, propionate is the\\nsecond most popular plastic frame material. It is hypoallergenic and nylon-\\nbased, and it has a different look and feel than other types of plastic. Lumen\\nOptometric has expertise in different kinds of eye care services. Whether\\nyou’re considering Neurolens treatment or you’re simply looking for a new pair\\nof glasses, our staff will ensure that your needs are met.

What’s less well-known is what these\\ndifferent eye conditions are. Presbyopia is one of these diseases. It’s a\\ncondition that usually affects people aged over 40 and makes it harder for\\ntheir eyes to focus on objects. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing\\nsmall print, such as text messages, clearly. No need to worry though—to help\\nrestore your vision, a scleral optometrist will prescribe you multifocal\\nlenses if you’re a good candidate for one. In general, there are three types\\nof multifocal lenses: Bifocal lenses – As the name suggests, bifocal lenses\\nhave two prescriptions: the upper lens helps you see objects from afar while\\nthe lower lens helps you read and focus on objects near you.Trifocal lenses –\\nLike bifocal lenses, trifocal lenses have upper and lower lenses that help you\\nwith distance vision and reading respectively. The difference between the two\\nis that trifocal lenses, as the name suggests, have a middle section that\\nhelps you with tasks that require intermediate vision, like using a laptop.\\nProgressive lenses – Progressive lens don’t have the lines found on bifocal or\\ntrifocal lenses. That’s because the power of the lenses gradually changes from\\nthe top to the bottom. Adjusting to Your New Bifocal Lenses Multifocal lenses\\nwill take some getting used to. Here are some tips on adjusting to your new\\nmultifocal lenses: Wear your multifocal lenses all the time – You’ll get used\\nto your new multifocal lenses faster if you wear them all the time. Don’t look\\ndown while walking or going down the stairs – The lower part of your bifocal\\nlenses makes everything look bigger, so your feet may appear out-of-focus. If\\nyou need to look down while walking, make sure to tilt your head up and look\\nthrough the upper portion of your multifocal lenses. Make sure your new\\nmultifocal eyeglasses fit your face properly – It’s harder to get used to\\nmultifocal eyeglasses and lenses if they don’t fit your face properly. For\\nmore info about your multifocal lenses, neurolens treatment, and your other\\ntreatment options, don’t hesitate to consult your eye doctor. Looking for eye\\nspecialists near you?

This assessment is crucial to\\ndiagnosing, preventing and treating eye conditions that could lead to vision\\nloss. To help you further understand what dilated eye exams are, Lumen\\nOptometric is here to answer the most commonly asked questions about this\\nprocess. “What Is a Dilated Eye Exam?” A dilated eye exam involves pupil\\ndilation, which is a simple and painless procedure performed to increase the\\nsize of the pupils. This process allows your ophthalmologist to assess the\\nhealth of your optic nerve and retina. If you are nearsighted or farsighted,\\nyour eye doctor will give you dilating eye drops to check vision problems that\\nhinder you from seeing clearly. “What Conditions Can It Detect?” Glaucoma,\\nmacular degeneration, retinal detachment and ocular tumor are some of the\\nconditions that can be diagnosed with a dilated eye exam. This procedure\\nprovides optimum viewing of the dilated pupil, which allows for the diagnosis\\nand monitoring of the retina. While there are some diseases that can be\\ndetected without pupil dilation, a dilated eye exam is still important to\\nensure an accurate and complete diagnosis. “What Can I Expect During the\\nExam?” When your eyes are dilated, your vision may be blurry and your eyes may\\nbe sensitive to light for a few hours. For your safety, ask a loved one to\\ndrive you home from your eye appointment. In case your eye doctor finds\\nrefractive errors in your vision, they may provide you with a prescription for\\neyeglasses or contact lenses to help improve your eyesight. At Lumen\\nOptometric, we are committed to providing only the best eye care services to\\nhelp you take care of your vision problems.

This treatment can help\\nwith tired eyes, eye fatigue and headaches. The neurolenses® that we provide\\nuse patented and clinically tested technology to correct your eyes’\\nmisalignment. Are you curious about the neurolens treatment and want to learn\\nmore? In today’s article, Lumen Optometric answers some frequently asked\\nquestions about neurolenses. How Does It Work? The neurolens Measurement test\\nwill determine if you are a good candidate for neurolenses. These lenses are\\nthe first and only prescription lenses that can help correct the misalignment\\nin a patient’s vision at all distances. Using neurolenses has been found to\\nrelieve symptoms like neck pain/tension, eyestrain, headaches and eye fatigue.\\nHow Often Should I Use It? Your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen\\nOptometric recommends that you wear your neurolenses during all your waking\\nhours for the best results. If this is not possible, then you should at least\\nwear these lenses while doing near work like reading or using a digital\\ndevice. In general, you should see results with your neurolenses within your\\nfirst three to seven days of wearing them. Some patients might take longer\\nhowever, sometimes taking up to three weeks. Does It Still Work If I Use\\nContacts or If I Have 20/20 Vision? Your new neurolenses incorporate both your\\nregular eyeglasses prescription and your contoured prism prescription. If you\\nprefer wearing contact lenses, then you can order your neurolenses to only use\\nyour contoured prism prescription. You’ll just need to wear your neurolenses\\nwhile wearing your contacts. This also means that people with 20/20 vision can\\nstill use neurolenses if they suffer from misalignment. We provide a\\ncomprehensive range of eye care services including dry eye treatment, eye\\nexams and more. Lumen Optometric works with some of the most experienced and\\ndedicated eye doctors and eye care professionals. Our focus is on balancing\\nyour visual health, comfort and clarity.

January 5, 2021 by Lumen\\nOptometric Are Myopia Management Contact Lenses Safe for Children? We meet\\ndozens of parents and children every day who come in for eye exams, myopia\\ntreatments and other services. During these visits, we welcome and address\\nquestions or concerns that parents have about their child’s eye health.\\nBecause certain myopia treatments include contact lens wear, many parents ask\\nwhether they’re safe to wear for young children. Here’s what the research\\nsays: A recent study, Adverse Event Rates in The Retrospective Cohort Study of\\nSafety of Paediatric Soft Contact Lens Wear: the ReCSS Study, shows that\\ncontact lenses for children are just as safe for children as they are for\\nadults. (This study appears in the January 2021 issue of the peer-reviewed\\nJournal of Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics.) The study followed 963 children\\naged 8 to 16 over the course of 1.5 to 3 years (for a combined 2713 years of\\ncontact lens wear time) to determine the risk level associated with wearing\\nsoft contact lenses. All of the subjects were 13 years of age or under at the\\ntime of their first fitting, with more than half of the children fitted with\\nsoft contacts at or before the age of 10, on average. The study results\\nindicate that age doesn’t play a role in contact lens safety. In fact, the\\nrisks of developing adverse reactions to contact lens wear among children\\nproved to be the same as in adults. According to the study, the rate of\\ninflammatory conditions associated with contact lens wear were less than 1%\\nper year of wear. Multifocal Lenses for Myopia Management One effective method\\nof myopia management includes the use of MiSight daily multifocal soft contact\\nlenses. MiSight contact lenses are FDA approved for the treatment of myopia\\nand have been shown to effectively slow down the rate of myopia progression.\\nMany parents like this method as it requires minimal maintenance; at bedtime,\\nthe child discards the pair they are wearing, and inserts a fresh pair in the\\nmorning. It also rids the child of the need to wear glasses during the day,\\nallowing them to freely partake in sports and other activities. The myopia\\nmanagement program at Treehouse Eyes can help preserve your child’s gift of\\nsight for a lifetime. Treating your child’s myopia will give them clear vision\\ntoday, while reducing their chances of developing sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases later in life. it’s never too early to start treating myopia.

November 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Today, you can have\\nyour eyes checked without actually seeing your eye doctor using online vision\\ntests. Many eye clinics offer these tests that you can accomplish via your\\nsmartphone. They claim to determine how sharp your vision is, if you have\\nastigmatism, or experiencing eye sensitivity. Discover if online eye tests are\\nany good and when they are useful from a local eye exam doctor. Are Online Eye\\nTests as Good as Visiting Your Eye Doctor? Typically, an online eye test only\\nchecks your visual acuity and gives an estimate of your refractive error.\\nSometimes, it includes contrast sensitivity and color blindness. However, this\\nkind of test can’t determine if you have conditions like glaucoma, cataracts,\\nor macular degeneration. Keep in mind that routine eye exams with your eye\\ndoctor are still irreplaceable. Get your eyes checked as frequently as advised\\nby your eye specialist. Regular comprehensive eye exams can help with the\\nearly detection and treatment of different eye conditions, especially those\\nthat don’t show symptoms until their later stages. When Are They Helpful? When\\nyou’re away, and you break or lose your glasses or contact lenses, that’s when\\nonline eye tests are most useful. Sometimes, an online vision test can help\\nkeep track of your eyesight and refractive error between routine eye exams.\\nStill, it helps to know that the results of some online eye tests have been\\nvalidated with limited studies because it’s still a new and developing\\ntechnology. More studies are required to ensure the accuracy of prescriptions\\ngenerated by online vision tests. For your family’s eye care needs, turn to\\nLumen Optometric.

While they are\\na common, albeit harmless, condition among infants, blocked tear ducts\\ndeveloping in adults may indicate an underlying problem. Lumen Optometric, the\\ntrusted scleral optometrist in the area, shares more of the essentials you\\nneed to know. What Can Cause Blocked Tear Ducts? There are many different\\nreasons blocked tear ducts can occur. These may develop because of an age-\\nrelated change, when the tiny openings (puncta) that allow tears to drain\\nbecome narrower, which can cause a blockage. Other common reasons include\\ninfection of the eyes, tear duct system, or nasal passages. An injury or\\ntrauma can also result in blocked tear ducts. This can be as minor as foreign\\nparticles getting lodged in the eyes, or as serious as a blow to the head or a\\nbroken nose. What are the Symptoms of Blocked Tear Ducts? Watery eyes and\\nexcess tears streaming from the eyes may be signs of a blocked tear duct. But\\nthese may be accompanied by: Redness and irritation of the affected eyeCrust\\nforming along the eyelidsExcess mucus or discharge from the eyesEye\\ninfections, like pink eye or conjunctivitisPain and inflammation of the inside\\ncorner of the eyeBlurred vision You should note, however, that watery eyes due\\nto cold or sinus infection may be unrelated to a blocked tear duct. The same\\ngoes for swelling or redness in the eyes, which may be a result of an injury\\nthat doesn’t affect the tear ducts. When you’re experiencing some or most of\\nthe symptoms mentioned above, you should go see Lumen Optometric, your trusted\\nlocal eye doctor promptly. We don’t just specialize in dry eye treatment–we\\ncan also manage a number of other eye conditions. How Do You Deal with Blocked\\nTear Ducts? While a blocked tear duct can result in discomfort and swelling,\\nit is almost always correctable. Its treatment will depend on its underlying\\ncause. To accurately pinpoint the reason for your blocked tear ducts, we’ll\\nperform a comprehensive eye examination and, depending on the results,\\nrecommend the effective and appropriate solution.

January 8, 2021 by Lumen Optometric\\nToday, children are more exposed to digital devices, which makes a lot of\\nparents worry. Using devices like computers, cellphones, and tablets can\\nresult in digital eye strain. One of the things that are believed to help\\nprevent the condition is blue light glasses. Find out if blue light glasses\\ncan protect children against digital eye strain from a scleral optometrist.\\nWhere Does Blue Light Come From? Blue light is visible light with shorter\\nwavelengths but more energy than other light at the other end of the color\\nspectrum. The main source of blue light is the sun but it can also come from\\nyour digital devices, LED lights, television screens, and fluorescent lights.\\nFortunately, there is no known evidence that blue light from screens is\\ndamaging to a child’s eyes. Do Blue Light Glasses Work? Kids who spend hours\\nin front of screens are more prone to develop digital eye strain or computer\\nvision syndrome. Among the most common signs of this eye condition are eye\\nfatigue, headaches, shoulder or neck pain, changes in vision, and dry eye. To\\nkeep track of your child’s vision and ensure their eyes are healthy, visit\\nyour eye doctor regularly. At Lumen Optometric, you can count on us to take\\ncare of your child’s eyes. We specialize in myopia treatment, dry eye\\ntreatment, and more. Blue light glasses are available in prescription and non-\\nprescription lenses. These glasses have a slight yellow tint to the lenses and\\ncan help prevent digital eye strain in children. However, these glasses do not\\ncompletely filter all blue light but they can reduce your child’s exposure by\\nup to at least 80 percent. Still, the best way to prevent this eye condition\\nis limiting your child’s screen time, especially for younger ones. For your\\nfamily’s eye care needs, Lumen Optometric is here to help. We offer neurolens\\ntreatment, scleral lenses, orthokeratology, and more. Call us at (626)\\n921-0199 or fill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

Let’s explore the efficacy of correcting visual habits in\\nmitigating its advancement. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent ocular\\ncondition with multifaceted causes and implications. In this post, we delve\\ninto whether myopia can worsen despite corrected visual habits. The Mechanisms\\nof Myopia Occurrence: The journey of myopia onset is intricate and begins\\nbefore visual symptoms manifest. Research indicates that the eye undergoes\\naccelerated axial growth one to two years before myopia becomes clinically\\nevident. During this period, compensatory mechanisms within the eye attempt to\\ncounteract the elongation, including the flattening of the anterior surface of\\nthe lens. However, these mechanisms eventually exhaust themselves, leading to\\nthe establishment of myopic refractive status—an early-to-mid stage\\nirreversible pathological change. The Influence of Age on Myopia Progression:\\nUnderstanding the age at which myopia sets in is crucial in predicting its\\nprogression. Studies suggest that the earlier myopia occurs and the faster it\\nprogresses, the less responsive it is to interventions aimed at improving\\nvisual habits. This underscores the importance of early detection and\\nintervention in younger individuals to potentially mitigate the severity of\\nmyopia progression. Challenges in Eliminating Causative Visual Habits: While\\ncorrecting visual habits is a fundamental aspect of managing myopia, it’s\\nessential to acknowledge the challenges associated with eliminating causative\\nfactors. Factors such as excessive near work, limited outdoor time, and\\ngenetic predispositions contribute to myopia development. Despite concerted\\nefforts to modify these habits, complete eradication remains elusive, posing a\\ncontinued risk for myopia progression. Conclusion : In conclusion, the journey\\nof myopia progression is complex, and influenced by various factors including\\nage, genetic predispositions, and environmental habits. While correcting\\nvisual habits is beneficial, it’s crucial to recognize the limitations in\\neliminating causative factors. Early intervention remains key in potentially\\nslowing down myopia progression, emphasizing the importance of regular eye\\nexams and proactive management strategies. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed\\nto empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources to navigate their\\nmyopia journey effectively. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment\\nplans for your child.

June 10, 2021 by Lumen\\nOptometric Sleep is crucial to your health and to every part of your body,\\nincluding your eyes. It ensures that your eyes have enough moisture and rest\\nto perform well. If you are not getting enough sleep, this could affect your\\neyes and increase your risks of various side effects ranging from mild (dark\\ncircles and puffy eyes) to severe (eye infections and vision loss). Lumen\\nOptometric, a trusted provider of contact lenses and eye care services,\\nfurther discusses the negative impact of poor sleeping habits on your overall\\neye health. Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Eyes One common but less\\ndangerous effect of poor sleep is having dark circles underneath your eyes.\\nSome people, though, are more prone to having puffy eyes rather than dark\\ncircles after a night of inadequate sleep. In other cases, when people are not\\nable to get enough sleep, they experience eye spasms and twitching throughout\\nthe day. This often makes it difficult to do work or activities like reading.\\nIt can also pose hazards if you are driving. Another usual side effect of\\nsleep deprivation is having strained, dry and itchy eyes the next day. This is\\na slightly more serious effect of poor sleep. Dry eyes specifically can be\\npainful and it can cause irritation. This is mainly because your eyes are not\\ngetting proper lubrication. Lack of sleep may also cause your eyes to be\\nsensitive to light or your vision to be blurry. People who don’t get enough\\nsleep have an increased risk of glaucoma, a condition caused by excessive\\nbuildup inside the eye. If you have been experiencing these symptoms more\\nfrequently, make sure to visit an eye exam doctor. You should also address the\\nsource of your eye symptoms — in this case, poor sleeping habits. Tips on\\nImproving Your Sleep Remember that your eyes go through a lot whenever you’re\\nawake. They work several hours a day, so it is important to give them enough\\ntime to recover through sleep. If you are having problems getting a good\\nquality of sleep, here are some tips that might help you: Exercise regularly.\\nThis can help you sleep better, but make sure to avoid it three hours before\\nyour bedtime.Get as much sunlight as you can during the day.As much as\\npossible, avoid exposure to blue light and digital screens at least two hours\\nbefore bedtime.Consider wearing an eye mask if you get stimulated even by the\\nfaintest of lights at night. You can also try blackout blinds to prevent\\noutdoor lights from seeping into your bedroom.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says 90% of\\nthese incidents are preventable. Generally, the kind of eye protection you\\nneed depends on the potential hazards present in your workplace. A local\\northokeratology expert shares some of the most common causes of workplace eye\\ninjuries. What Are the Common Causes of Workplace Eye Injuries? Flying Objects\\nDoes your job involve sanding, riveting, chiseling, hammering, riveting or\\nmachining? If so, you must wear appropriate eye protection like safety\\nglasses, face shields or goggles. These tasks can expose you to small flying\\nobjects that can enter your eyes, including metal fragments, wood particles\\nand cement chips. Chemicals You must be careful when working with chemicals\\nbecause they can cause irreversible eye damage. Proper safety gear will\\nprotect your eyes from chemical splashes, fumes and vapors. Gasoline, grease,\\noil and paint thinner can also harm your eyes. Object or Tool Penetration\\nPermanent eye damage can occur due to the penetration of tools or sharp\\nobjects. When this incident happens, seek medical attention immediately.\\nAlways wear safety glasses and avoid tools you have no experience using.\\nRadiation Lasers and welding equipment can produce high levels of infrared,\\nultraviolet radiation and heat. Workers need to wear safety goggles when\\nperforming tasks involving these tools. Doing so will protect them from eye\\nproblems like cataracts, retinal burns and blindness. Which Eye Problems\\nUsually Occur at Work? Digital Eye Strain Many jobs today require you to stare\\nat digital screens for hours. If you spend a significant time in front of a\\ncomputer, you might experience digital eye strain. Headaches, dry eyes and\\nblurred vision characterize this condition. It can also cause neck and\\nshoulder pain. These symptoms can occur due to glare on screens, poor seating\\nposture and improper viewing distances. Uncorrected refractive errors like\\nnearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism can also trigger digital eye\\nstrain symptoms. The only way to know if you need prescription eyeglasses or\\ncontact lenses is to get an eye exam. Moreover, taking breaks from computer\\nscreens and ensuring good lighting will help alleviate eye strain. Eye\\nInfection Usually, eye diseases spread in the workplace through droplets from\\nsneezing or coughing. You might develop an eye infection if you accidentally\\ntouch your eyes with contaminated hands. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis\\noccurs from exposure to Staphylococcus species and other bacteria. Its\\nsymptoms include eye redness, burning and a sensation of having something\\ninside the eye. Artificial tears, antibiotics and other topical medications\\nare the common treatment options for this eye condition. Regular visits to\\nyour eye exam doctor will go a long way in keeping your eyes healthy and\\nmaintaining good vision. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care\\nneeds.

You may be dealing with what’s known as\\ncomputer vision syndrome (CVS). An orthokeratology and eyecare expert explores\\nthe causes and symptoms of CVS and how this condition can be corrected. Causes\\nand Symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome Extended screen time, a lack of\\nsufficient lighting, poor posture and bad visual habits can lead to computer\\nvision syndrome. Over time, our eyes have a hard time focusing and refocusing\\non digital screens, causing multiple discomforts. The main symptoms of CVS\\ninclude difficulty shifting focus, dry or itchy eyes, recurrent headaches, and\\nblurred or double vision. In some cases, it may also cause neck, shoulder, and\\nback pain, creating a ripple effect on your overall well-being. Can Computer\\nVision Syndrome Be Corrected? The good news is that computer vision syndrome\\ncan be corrected. It is not a permanent condition, so your vision can improve\\nsignificantly with the right approach and professional help. Here are just\\nsome of the methods that can be employed: Eye Exercises Specific eye exercises\\ncan be suggested by your eye exam doctor to alleviate the symptoms of CVS.\\nThese exercises can help strengthen your eye muscles and improve your eyes’\\nability to focus. Prescription Glasses In some cases, prescription glasses\\nspecially designed for computer use may be recommended. These glasses have\\ncoatings to reduce glare and block harmful blue light emitted by digital\\nscreens. Vision Therapy This is a customized program of visual activities\\ndesigned to correct specific vision problems and improve visual skills. Vision\\ntherapy can help treat CVS by training the eye muscles to reduce strain and\\nimprove visual comfort when using screens. Lubricating Eye Drops Dry eye is\\nanother symptom of CVS, and you can use lubricating eye drops to combat it.\\nThese drops help replenish your eye’s surface and maintain moisture.\\nEnvironmental Modifications This could include adjusting the lighting in your\\nworkspace to reduce glare, positioning your computer screen at an optimal\\ndistance and angle, and increasing the font size on your screen to reduce eye\\nstrain.

During this appointment, your eye care professional\\nwill assess your eyes and determine the most suitable type of contact lenses\\nfor your needs. Here’s what you can expect during your contact lens fitting\\nsession. Assessment of Your Eye Health and Vision Needs Your eye care\\nprofessional will begin by reviewing your medical and eye health history. This\\nexamination includes a check of visual acuity, an evaluation of eye movements\\nand an examination of the general well-being of your eyes to determine whether\\neye conditions might affect your suitability for wearing contact lenses.\\nPrecision Measurements for a Perfect Fit Following the eye health assessment,\\nthe optometrist or ophthalmologist will meticulously measure the curvature and\\ndiameter of your corneas. These measurements are crucial for determining the\\ncorrect size and type of contact lenses that will provide the best fit for\\nyour eyes, preventing discomfort and potential complications. For instance,\\nscleral lenses are larger than standard contact lenses and rest on the white\\npart of your eye, the sclera. Due to their design, optometrists perform a more\\ndetailed fitting process for scleral contact lenses than regular contacts.\\nTailoring to Your Lifestyle and Preferences Your lifestyle and preferences\\nplay a significant role in the recommendation of suitable contact lenses. The\\neye care professional will take into account factors such as your level of\\nphysical activity, preferred wearing schedule and specific vision correction\\nneeds. Communicating your preferences ensures personalized recommendations.\\nFollow-Up Appointment A follow-up appointment is typically scheduled after a\\nweek or two to ensure you adapt well to your new contact lenses. Your eye care\\nprofessional will check for any changes in eye health and may adjust your\\nprescription or lens type if necessary. They can also help you identify issues\\nlike dry eyes that could affect lens comfort and recommend dry eye treatment\\nas needed. Contact lens fitting is a comprehensive process that requires\\nprofessional expertise for the best outcome. Lumen Optometric is a premier eye\\ncare provider dedicated to improving your eye health.

Read on as Lumen\\nOptometric explains why, when, and how your contact lenses may impact your\\nexamination results. Should You Wear or Not Wear Contact Lenses for an Eye\\nExam? Eye exams sometimes involve more than just reading a standard eye chart.\\nThere can be several tests, each targeting a different aspect of your eye\\nhealth. The primary concern with leaving your lenses in during the exam is the\\npotential for inaccuracies. Contact lenses can disguise certain eye conditions\\nor changes in your prescription. They might also obscure indications of dry\\neye, a condition that demands effective treatment early on. As such, it is\\npreferable to take contact lenses out at least two hours before the\\nappointment. Doing so allows your cornea to revert to its natural shape—which\\ncan be altered by prolonged contact lens wear—ensuring a more accurate\\nexamination. Discussing Your Contact Lens Concerns During an Eye Examination\\nDuring your eye exam, be sure to discuss your contact lens experiences with\\nyour eye care provider. This way, they can evaluate your eyes with them on and\\noff. For instance, if you mention issues with blurry vision or eye fatigue,\\nthey might consider a neurolens treatment, a revolutionary option for\\ncorrecting misalignments and bringing comfort. Likewise, if you’re a candidate\\nfor scleral lenses, they will have a specialized understanding of your contact\\nlens fitting. Lenses should not just correct vision but should also promote\\noverall eye health. Reach Out to Lumen Optometric Taking off your contact\\nlenses before an eye exam is often beneficial, allowing your optometrist to\\nconduct a more comprehensive and precise test. For any of your eye health\\nconcerns, look no further than Lumen Optometric! Call us at (626) 921-0199, or\\nfill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

September 1, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Contact lenses offer\\na safe and effective way to correct poor vision, being especially useful to\\nthose who find eyeglasses inconvenient or uncomfortable. But in order to get\\nthe most out of your contact lenses, you’ll need to make sure they’re worn\\nproperly. Some people, for instance, leave their contact lenses in for too\\nlong, which is risky and highly discouraged. Lumen Optometric, the premier eye\\nexam doctor in the area, explains more. Why You Shouldn’t Overwear Contact\\nLenses Avoid wearing your contact lenses for too long in a day, and you\\nabsolutely shouldn’t leave them on when you sleep. Doing so can lead to\\ncomplications with your eyesight. In fact, prolonged contact lens use may\\ncause the wearer to experience the following symptoms: Inflammation of the\\ncornea, or keratitisRedness and swelling of the conjunctiva, or the\\ntransparent skin covering the whites of the eyesEyelid swellingLight\\nsensitivityBlurred visionDry eyesBurning sensation when the contact lens are\\ninserted But How Long Is ‘Too Long’? The period may vary with each patient,\\nbut it’s generally recommended that contact lenses are worn for a maximum of\\n10-12 hours each day. Anything longer than that can put the eyes at risk of\\ninfection and discomfort. If you’re using contact lenses for the first time\\n(and don’t have dry, sensitive eyes) your eye care specialist may suggest\\nwearing them for 6-8 hours on that first day. How to Deal With Overwear If\\nyou’ve left your contact lenses for too long and are now experiencing adverse\\neffects, the first thing you’ll need to do is visit a trusted eye doctor like\\nLumen Optometric for a comprehensive eye exam and the necessary solution. Our\\neye specialists will suspend contact lens wear until all the symptoms have\\nbeen resolved. As your eyes heal, we may suggest switching to a new lens\\nmaterial with higher oxygen permeability, or recommend using daily disposable\\nlenses. Schedule Your Eye Exam Today Whether you need contact lens exams or\\ncorneal reshaping therapy, Lumen Optometric has got you covered.

This\\ncondition pertains to the clouding of the lens of the eye. According to the\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 17.2% of Americans older\\nthan 40 have cataracts in one or both eyes. While a common eye condition, many\\nmyths still surround cataracts. A local orthokeratology specialist debunks\\nfive of them. 1\\\\. Cataracts Only Occur in Older Adults One of the most popular\\nmisconceptions about cataracts is that they only occur in older adults. The\\ntruth is they can be present at birth. Cataracts can also develop in younger\\nindividuals, and some medications can increase your risk for cataracts, such\\nas corticosteroids. 2\\\\. Overusing Your Eyes Can Cause Cataracts How much you\\nuse your eyes doesn’t have anything to do with your risk of developing\\ncataracts. However, cataracts can make doing up-close work more challenging.\\nWhile healthy lifestyle changes can’t prevent cataracts, they can slow down\\nthe eye condition’s progression. 3\\\\. Eye Drops Can Treat Cataracts No eye\\ndrops can prevent or dissolve cataracts. Cataracts are not growths but changes\\nin the structure of the lens. Removing and replacing the affected lens is the\\nonly way to treat this eye condition. If you have cataracts, only an eye exam\\ndoctor can determine which treatment option suits you. 4\\\\. Cataract Surgery Is\\nRisky Cataract surgery is one of today’s safest procedures, with a success\\nrate of 95%. It’s painless and only takes around 15 to 20 minutes. You can\\nusually leave the hospital a few hours following the surgery. Most patients\\nrecover within four weeks, but some notice a significant improvement in their\\nvision a few days after the procedure. 5\\\\. Cataracts Can Go Back Following\\nSurgery Once the affected lens has been replaced, cataracts will not recur.\\nHowever, some people may experience cloudy vision because the membrane holding\\nthe synthetic lens can decline with age.

However, beware of what is and isn’t true about your eyes. Doing your\\nresearch and learning the truth can help you better take care of your eyes. A\\nlocal scleral optometrist debunks some of the most common myths about vision\\nand eye health. Reading in the Dark Is Harmful to Your Eyes Your mom has\\nprobably told you that you shouldn’t read in the dark because it will damage\\nyour eyes. Reading in low lighting conditions may lead to eye fatigue or a\\nheadache but it can’t cause permanent damage. Constantly Wearing Your Glasses\\nWill Weaken Your Eyes Wearing glasses will not make your eyes weak. While some\\neye conditions will get worse over the years, it doesn’t have anything to do\\nwith glasses. Moreover, your glasses are there to help you see better and\\ncorrect your vision. Using Digital Devices a Lot Is Bad for Your Eyes Using\\nyour phone, computer, and other digital devices for an extended period can\\nresult in eye fatigue. However, it will not result in nearsightedness,\\nfarsightedness, or astigmatism. To avoid eye strain, make sure you’re taking\\nbreaks in between using your devices. It would also help to wear the right\\neyewear. At Lumen Optometric, we offer neurolens treatment and other vision\\ncorrection options. Eating Carrots Will Make Your Vision Better Another common\\nmyth about your vision is that it will improve by eating carrots. This\\nvegetable is rich in vitamin A, which is necessary for you to maintain good\\neyesight. However, your body only needs a tiny amount of vitamin A for vision\\nand you can get it from other sources like fish, dairy, darky leafy greens,\\nand bright-colored vegetables.

In this blog post, we’ll explore this topic\\nand examine the existing evidence surrounding the relationship between sleep\\npatterns and vision in children and teenagers. The Link Between Sleep Habits\\nand Vision: Currently, there’s a lack of direct clinical trial evidence\\nconfirming the precise impact of sleep habits on vision. However, intriguing\\nfindings from animal models provide suggestive insights into this connection.\\nDisrupting the overall circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep-wake cycles,\\nmay potentially influence refractive development in the eye. Understanding the\\nRole of Circadian Rhythm: The eye is a complex organ, with various components\\noperating on their own biological rhythms. These include the cornea, choroid,\\nintraocular pressure, and lens. Disrupting these biological rhythms can affect\\nthe rate of eye growth, potentially impacting vision development over time.\\nIndirect Evidence and Myopia Risk: While direct clinical evidence is lacking,\\nindirect evidence from animal models suggests that staying up late and waking\\nup late—common habits among children and teenagers—may increase the risk of\\nmyopia. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent vision condition\\ncharacterized by difficulty seeing distant objects clearly. Considerations and\\nCaution: It’s essential to interpret these findings with caution and recognize\\nthe limitations of extrapolating animal model data to human populations. While\\nsuggestive, these findings do not provide definitive answers regarding the\\nimpact of sleep habits on vision in children and teenagers. Conclusion: In\\nconclusion, the relationship between sleep habits and vision in children and\\nteenagers remains an area of ongoing research and investigation. While animal\\nmodel studies suggest a potential link between disrupted circadian rhythms and\\nvision development, direct clinical evidence is needed to confirm these\\nfindings in human populations. Fostering healthy sleep habits for children is\\nessential for overall well-being, including their vision health. Encouraging\\nconsistent sleep schedules and adequate rest may contribute to optimal vision\\ndevelopment. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed to staying informed about the\\nlatest research and providing comprehensive care to support your child’s\\nmyopia treatment journey.

May 8, 2020 by Lumen Optometric It’s\\nnot uncommon to feel irritation or scratchiness in our eyes. This sensation is\\ntypically associated with dry eye and seasonal allergies, even though the\\ndifference between the two is often muddled. This may be due to the fact that\\nboth conditions can affect our eyes simultaneously, the symptoms overlapping.\\nFortunately, with a specific dry eye treatment and simple lifestyle tweaks,\\nyour visual issues can still be corrected. What Is Dry Eye? Dry eye is a\\ncommon problem that is likely to occur after age 50. It is a condition\\nexperienced by people who don’t have enough quality tears to lubricate and\\nnourish their eyes. Dry eye can occur due to several causes, including tears\\nnot being made properly and tears evaporating too fast. Other patients may\\nhave a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, where the glands in the\\neyelids become clogged, preventing the production of oil found in tears. More\\nthan 86% of all patients with dry eye have this condition. Another possible\\nreason for dry eye is ocular misalignment which can be corrected by neurolens\\ntreatment. Is It Seasonal Allergies? The symptoms of seasonal allergies can be\\nsimilar to dry eye, but the indicating sign is itchiness. When the eye is\\nexposed to an allergen like pollen and pet dander, histamines are released,\\ncausing the eyes to itch or tear. If seasonal allergies are affecting your\\neye, taking antihistamine can be quite effective to fight the inflammation.\\nThere are other steps you can take to ease your allergy symptoms. Close the\\nwindows and doors in your eyes when the pollen count is high outdoors. Use\\nclean mattress covers on your bed to prevent dust mites. Use a dehumidifier in\\nyour home when humidity levels are high to prevent the growth of mold and\\nmildew. Wear sunglasses when you’re outside to help keep pollen out of your\\neyes. When experiencing a severe dry eye, it’s safer not to assume the cause\\nand instead seek out professional advice from an eye doctor or a scleral\\noptometrist. Here at Lumen Optometric, we can expertly determine the cause of\\nyour symptoms and prescribe the appropriate treatment plan.

Read on to discover how sports eyewear\\ncan help improve your performance and where you can find personalized eyewear\\nsolutions just right for your sport of choice. Benefits of Wearing Sports\\nEyewear The right sports eyewear can be a game-changer in the following ways:\\nEnhancing Visual Performance Stepping up your game begins with seeing the game\\nbetter. Sports eyewear, whether it’s a simple pair of sports glasses or\\ncustomized contact lenses, can significantly enhance your ability to focus and\\nsee clearly. For every basketball player aiming for the hoop or a tennis\\nplayer watching out for the incoming serve, better vision equals better\\nperformance. Protective Features Beyond improving your vision, another crucial\\nreason to wear sports eyewear is to protect your eyes from potential injuries.\\nHigh-speed sports like hockey or racquetball create numerous opportunities for\\nerrant balls or pucks to cause serious harm to your eyes. Protective sports\\neyewear can guard against these risks and provide peace of mind as you play.\\nImportance of Correct Prescription and Fit Just like the right cleats or a\\ncozy pair of gloves, having the proper prescription and fit for sports eyewear\\nis essential. An incorrect prescription can defeat the purpose of wearing\\neyewear and hinder your game performance. Similarly, eyewear that doesn’t fit\\nsecurely can become a distraction or slip off at an inconvenient time. It’s\\ncrucial to consult an eye exam doctor to ensure your prescription is up-to-\\ndate and your eyewear fits well. Different Types of Sports Eyewear Depending\\non the sport, there are many types of eyewear to choose from. Sports Glasses\\nThese are excellent for those who require a prescription for their vision but\\nalso need the structural robustness to withstand physical sports. Sports\\nglasses typically have reinforced frames and lenses to maintain their shape\\nand performance. Prescription Sports Goggles For those involved in high-impact\\nsports, prescription sports goggles offer a higher level of protection. They\\nfit snugly to your face to prevent any foreign objects or harsh sunlight from\\nimpairing your vision. Sports Sunglasses For those sunny outdoor games, sports\\nsunglasses not only improve your vision but also shield your eyes from harmful\\nUV rays, helping to prevent long-term eye damage. Lumen Optometric: Enhancing\\nYour Sports Performance At Lumen Optometric, we aim to help you find the ideal\\neyewear for your sporting needs. We offer comprehensive eye exams to ascertain\\nyour precise prescription and orthokeratology services for those looking for a\\nlens-free solution.

These are often serious and need medical attention. Neurolens\\ntreatment specialist Lumen Optometric has shared below what you need to do if\\nyou have the following injuries: Embedded Foreign Object If an object, such as\\na piece of glass or metal, penetrates or enters the globe of the eye and/or is\\nsticking out, you’ll need to call for emergency medical help or bring the\\nchild to the emergency room as soon as possible. You should also cover the\\naffected eye with a small cup taped in place so that it keeps all pressure off\\nthe eye. Make sure to keep your child (and yourself) as calm and comfortable\\nas possible until help arrives. Irritations If your child has dirt, sand, or\\nother foreign bodies on their eye surface, our resident scleral optometrist\\nrecommends that you wash your hands thoroughly and examine the eye. Don’t\\ntouch, rub, or press the eye itself except by flushing, as other methods can\\neasily scratch the surface, especially the cornea. Next, tilt your child’s\\nhead over a basin or sink with the affected eye down and gently pull down the\\nlower lid. Encourage your child to open the eyes as wide as possible, but if\\nit’s an infant or small child, it’s helpful to have a second person hold the\\nchild’s eyes open while you flush. Afterward, gently pour a steady stream of\\nlukewarm water from a pitcher or faucet over the eye, and flush for up to 15\\nminutes. Check the eye every 5 minutes to see if the foreign body has been\\nflushed out. When you need to have your eyes checked by a trusted dry eye\\ntreatment expert, don’t hesitate to visit Lumen Optometric.

It is gas-permeable and it\\ncreates a saline-filled reservoir over your eye’s cornea. Scleral lenses can\\nbe used to treat various corneal conditions and they are among the safest and\\nmost effective forms of visual correction. To help get satisfactory results\\nand to ensure that your scleral lenses continue to be safe and reliable as you\\nuse them, scleral lenses and dry eye treatment expert Lumen Optometric shares\\nsome tips below. Know When to Remove Your Lenses Most scleral lens wearers can\\ncomfortably wear their lenses for 12 to 14 hours. However, experts recommend\\ntaking the lenses off one hour before you go to sleep. Moreover, if your\\nlenses fog throughout the day and you feel like you need to remove them\\nalready, don’t hesitate to do so. Typically, fogging occurs as a result of\\npoor alignment of the lens with the eye. In this kind of situation, the lens\\nrocks and causes mucus to form. The mucus then becomes trapped in the saline\\nlayer of the lens, which causes the blurry vision. That said, it is important\\nto get the best fit of scleral lenses for your eyes in order to minimize\\nfilming or fogging. Rub Lenses After Removing Make sure to rub your lenses\\nafter removing them so as to remove surface debris. You can ask your scleral\\noptometrist to demonstrate the proper way of doing this so that you can avoid\\ndamaging the lenses. Generally, it is ideal to rub each lens for two to 20\\nseconds, depending on your care solution. Use a Filling Solution With No\\nPreservatives A preservative-free filling solution is the best way to keep\\nyour eye’s health at an optimum level. Regular eye drops can cause damage to\\nyour eyes and your lenses because these often contain preservatives, so you\\nshould avoid using them at all times. Lumen Optometric offers a range of eye\\ncare services. Our expertise includes neurolens treatment, scleral lenses,\\nmyopia management, and more.

Do you experience these two problems at the same time as\\nwell? Is there a way to avoid or lessen their effects? Dry eye treatment\\nexperts from Lumen Optometric share some info! Dry Eye and Migraines Studies\\nhave been conducted on the theory of dry eye and migraines being involved with\\none another and worsening the effects of both. A study titled Tear Osmolarity\\nand Subjective Dry Eye Symptoms in Migraine Sufferers was made in 2017 and was\\nmade to explore this correlation. Tear osmolarity refers to the amount of salt\\ncontent in an individual’s tears. Tear osmolarity is a regular test for dry\\neyes, as the higher the salt content of a person’s tears, the more prone they\\nare to dry eye. In the above-mentioned study, they had 34 migraineurs in the\\nresearch group, and during the observation period, migraine attacks were\\ngenerally accompanied by dry eye. Additionally, the more frequent the migraine\\nattacks became, their tear osmolarity also increased. To summarize, the study\\nfocused on the link between migraines, dry eye, and tear osmolarity. And\\nduring the study, when migraines occurred, the effects of dry eye were also\\nobserved. And the more migraines with severe pain and discomfort the research\\nsubjects experienced, the saltier their tears became, resulting in them\\nbecoming more susceptible to dry eye. Dry Eye Treatment Contact lens users are\\nvery susceptible to the effects of dry eye, and these lenses need the right\\namount of lubrication to function comfortably on the surface of the eyes. If\\nyou’re someone who uses a contact lens and has been having bouts of dry eye,\\ncontacting your scleral optometrist or nearest eye clinic would be the best\\ncourse of action. If you’re getting dry eye that comes with migraine,\\nlessening the effects of both is possible by getting the proper dry eye\\nprescription and taking standard medications against migraines. Commonly,\\ntreatment for dry eye is done by the use of artificial tears, as dry eye\\nhappens when your eyes can’t get the right amount of lubrication they need.\\nWith eyes that lack the proper amount of lubrication, artificial tears are the\\noptimal way to address dry eye. They are available over-the-counter and come\\nin the form of liquid, gel, or ointment types. If your eyes are always tearing\\nup and lessening your tear reserves, getting assistance from an eye care\\nclinic and requesting tear duct plugs is a good way to prevent dry eye.\\nContact Us!

Determining the cause of your eye discomfort\\ncan be tricky, and getting the correct diagnosis and treatment to find relief\\nis essential. Continue reading to learn the difference between eye allergies\\nand infections, their symptoms, and when it’s time to seek professional help.\\nSymptoms of Eye Allergies If you’re dealing with an eye allergy, some common\\nsymptoms might include itching and redness, as well as watery or teary eyes.\\nYour eyelids may also appear swollen and you could experience sensitivity to\\nlight. These symptoms are usually caused by your body’s immune response to\\nallergens, leading to inflammation and discomfort. Symptoms of Eye Infections\\nOn the other hand, eye infections often come with different symptoms, such as\\npain or discomfort in the eye itself. You may notice yellow, green, or bloody\\ndischarge and crusting around the eye. Blurry vision or vision loss can be\\nassociated with eye infections too, so it’s essential to pay close attention\\nif you notice any of these signs. Causes of Eye Allergies Eye allergies can be\\ntriggered by various factors, such as seasonal allergens like pollen and grass\\nor indoor allergens like dust mites and pet dander. Irritants such as smoke,\\nperfume or chemicals can also cause allergic reactions in your eyes, making\\nthem feel itchy and uncomfortable. Causes of Eye Infections Eye infections, on\\nthe other hand, can arise from bacterial infections (like staphylococcus or\\nstreptococcus), viral infections (such as herpes or adenovirus) or even fungal\\ninfections (like aspergillus or candida). These types of diseases can be more\\nsevere and require immediate attention from a medical professional. Diagnosis\\nand Treatment If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, it’s crucial to\\nconsult a professional for a proper diagnosis. At Lumen Optometric, we offer a\\nvariety of treatments to address your specific needs. For instance, our\\nNeurolens treatment is an excellent option for those experiencing eye strain\\nand discomfort. If your eyes are feeling chronically dry and irritated, our\\ndry eye treatment can provide much-needed relief. If you wear contact lenses,\\nour skilled scleral optometrist can help fit you with the most comfortable\\nlenses possible. Prevention Tips To help prevent eye allergies and infections,\\nit’s essential to practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly. Avoid\\nallergens and irritants as much as possible, and keep your living space clean\\nto minimize exposure to indoor allergens. Regular eye exams and check-ups are\\nalso crucial to catching any potential issues early on.

Even if your vision seems clear,\\ngetting routine eye exams is essential. Many people aren’t even aware of an\\neye problem until they see an eye specialist. A local scleral optometrist\\nshares why regular eye exams matter even if you have 20/20 vision. Keep Track\\nof Vision Changes You will never know if your vision has changed or if you\\nneed to start wearing prescription glasses until you see a specialist. Eye\\ndoctors will perform various tests to trace even the slightest changes in your\\nvision. Regardless of age, you should schedule regular eye exams. It will\\nensure you have the appropriate vision correction eyewear, allowing you to see\\nclearly and comfortably. Your eye doctor can also determine if you need dry\\neye treatment during your appointment. Early Detection of Vision-Threatening\\nConditions Specialists can catch early signs of sight-threatening conditions\\nduring comprehensive eye exams. Cataracts, macular degeneration and glaucoma\\nare some eye problems that don’t manifest apparent symptoms until in their\\nlater stages. Early detection and treatment are crucial in preserving vision\\nand delaying the progression of these eye conditions. Catch Signs of Other\\nHealth Issues Your eyes can say a lot about your overall health. It isn’t\\nuncommon for eye doctors to detect indications of other health issues while\\nassessing their patients’ eyes. If this is the case, they will encourage you\\nto get further assessments from a medical practitioner. Common conditions\\ncaught during comprehensive eye exams include diabetes, hypertension, high\\ncholesterol, multiple sclerosis and thyroid diseases. At Lumen Optometric, we\\nwill thoroughly assess your eyes to catch problems that can affect your\\nvision. Let us help you monitor your vision and eye health! Aside from\\ncomprehensive eye exams, we also offer myopia, dry eye and neurolens\\ntreatment. Call us at (626) 921-0199 or complete our online form to schedule\\nan appointment.

We believe in helping our patients by providing\\nthem with the information that they need to safeguard their vision and eye\\nhealth. We strongly suggest scheduling comprehensive eye exams every one to\\ntwo years and familiarizing yourself with some of the early signs of eye\\nconditions. In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen\\nOptometric discusses the eye symptoms that you shouldn’t ignore. Double Vision\\nIf you experience double vision when both of your eyes are open, then it might\\nmean that your eye muscles aren’t aligned properly. Possible causes for this\\ncondition can include serious neurological problems, so you need to take this\\nsymptom seriously. If you only have double vision in one eye, then you might\\nhave an issue related to your retina or a cataract. We recommend scheduling an\\nappointment with us immediately so we can figure out the cause of this\\nproblem. Itching and Burning Sensation If you feel an itching and burning\\nsensation in your eyes then you might have a condition called blepharitis.\\nThis condition is caused by bacteria or microscopic mites that live on your\\neyelids. Other possibilities include a painful inflammation of the eyelid’s\\noil gland, infections, styes, or overexposure to UV rays. As an expert in\\ncontact lenses and eye exams, we can figure out the cause of this symptom.\\nSudden Increase in Floaters If you experience a sudden increase in the number\\nof floaters, then you need to see your eye doctor as soon as possible. This\\ncan indicate that the retina and blood vessels have been torn. If you also see\\nflashes of light, then this can be a sign of retinal detachment. Fortunately,\\neye doctors have a lot of options when it comes to treating this condition.\\nThe treatment depends on the location and size of the tear. If you need to\\nschedule an eye exam, then give Lumen Optometric a call. We offer\\ncomprehensive eye exams, orthokeratology and other vision care services. Our\\nmission is to create an exceptional eye care experience using the latest\\nresearch and technology. Our eye care professionals focus on balancing your\\nvisual clarity, health and comfort.

For people with poor vision, eyeglasses are their windows to a clearer\\nand more vivid world, so making sure that their glasses are well-maintained\\nand properly cared for is a high priority. If you wear glasses, there are a\\nfew things that you should keep in mind to keep your eyeglasses in an optimal\\ncondition, and corneal reshaping experts from Lumen Optometric are here to\\nhelp! Wiping Don’t use wet wipes, napkins, or paper towels. These cleaning\\nmaterials are made of wood pulp and have roughly textured surfaces that can\\nscratch the lenses of your eyeglasses and can affect the coating on them too.\\nAs much as you need to, avoid using the hem or the edge of your clothes in\\ncleaning them as well. Unless your shirt is made purely with cotton, wiping\\nyour lenses with it can cause more trouble in the long run. Microfiber cloth\\nis the best material to use when wiping grime, dirt, and other substances off\\nthe lenses, as they are designed to do so with great care and efficiency.\\nHandle With Care When performing maintenance and cleaning on your specs,\\nremember to properly handle them. Take them off by holding both sides, and\\ndon’t pull them off by using one hand, as this is one of the most common\\ncauses of joint snapping for older eyeglasses. Avoid holding them by one of\\ntheir frame arms, as it can bend your eyeglasses at an awkward angle and can\\ncause fitting issues. If you’re gonna wipe the lenses, hold your eyeglasses by\\nthe bridge (the part that goes over your nose) and gently wipe the lenses in a\\ncircular motion. If taking care of eyeglasses feels like a hassle for you, you\\ncan try having contact lenses prescribed to you instead. Cleaning Solutions\\nUsing strong chemical cleaning solutions on the surface of your lenses is not\\na good idea, as most household cleaning fluids contain ammonia or some other\\nform of strong acids. These can destroy and erode the protective coating over\\nthe lenses, and leave minuscule amounts of the chemical on the surface of the\\nlenses that are facing inwards toward your eyes, which can cause irritation\\nand discomfort, or worse, dry eye.

Let’s explore the pros and cons of\\nglasses and contacts to help you make the best choice for your eyes and\\nlifestyle. Advantages of Contact Lenses Contact lenses offer a clear, natural\\nfield of view without any obstructions or distortions at the edge of your\\nvision. For those concerned with their appearance, contact lenses won’t block\\nyour face or alter your appearance, although some can change your eye color.\\nFor athletes and those leading an active lifestyle, contact lenses are the way\\nto go as these are less likely to be dislodged. The range of options available\\nis vast. You can choose daily disposables, weeklies or even monthlies based on\\nyour comfort level and lifestyle. Before making your decision, schedule a\\ncomprehensive eye exam to identify any specific concerns or determine whether\\nyou need to work with a scleral optometrist. Disadvantages of Contact Lenses\\nOn the flip side, contact lenses require maintenance. They need to be properly\\ncleaned and stored, which can be time-consuming. Some people may even feel\\ndiscomfort or irritation, especially if they have sensitive eyes. Dry eyes can\\nbe a common issue for people considering the switch. Dry eye treatment is\\navailable and can greatly ease the transition to contact lenses. You may also\\nwant to consider a trial period with contacts before you fully commit to the\\nswitch. The risk of eye infections also increases as contacts are directly\\nworn on the eye. On top of that, the recurring expenses for contact lenses and\\ncare products can add up, making them an expensive choice in the long run.\\nMake the Switch With Lumen Optometric At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to\\ndiscuss your options—whether you are switching to contact lenses from\\neyeglasses or need a Neurolens treatment. Call us at (626) 921-0199 or visit\\nour contact page to schedule an appointment.

Eyesight only refers to the ability a person has to see clearly\\nwithout any corrective lenses, which varies from person to person and can\\nchange over time. Meanwhile, vision is the ability to process what a person\\nsees and it can be improved with practice. Lumen Optometric, the eye center to\\ntrust for neurolens treatment, gives more insight on how they differ from each\\nother. Eyesight This is something that takes place in the eye. Light enters\\nthrough the front of the eye and then an image is created on the retina. If\\nthe eye is not perfectly shaped, the image may not focus perfectly on the\\nretina. When this happens, some may wear glasses or contact lenses in order to\\nimprove eyesight or clarity of what they see, or in some cases, wear special\\nlenses prescribed by their trusted scleral optometrist. The image of what they\\nsee in their eyesight is then transferred to the brain where vision takes\\nplace. Vision This takes place in the brain. The brain receives a clear image\\nand then the vision is the process of understanding and analyzing the image.\\nThe brain automatically filters the information and determines what\\ninformation is important and ignores the rest of the information. Vision can\\nbe both consciously or subconsciously processed and is affected not only by\\ninformation coming in but also by what we expect to see due to prior\\nknowledge. How Do They Work Together? Let’s say a child is presented with a\\npicture of a cow. Eyesight is used to see the image clearly, while vision\\nprocesses what they see and recognizes what the image is. When an eye doctor\\ntells the child that they have 20/20 vision, they’re really saying that their\\neyesight is fine. While this means the child can see clearly, vision still\\nrefers to recognizing the image and whether both their eyes work together to\\nprocess what they see. So, if the child has never seen a cow before, their\\nvision won’t be able to recognize what the image is. When you need a trusted\\nspecialist on dry eye treatment, Lumen Optometric is the name you can count\\non. Call us today at (626) 921-0199, or you can fill out our convenient online\\nform.

Having myopia as a child significantly increases the risk of\\ndeveloping sight-threatening conditions like macular degeneration,, glaucoma,\\nand retinal detachment later in life. Even children with low levels of myopia\\nhave a greater risk of glaucoma and retinal detachment compared to their non-\\nmyopic counterparts. The good news is that slowing down the progression of\\nmyopia can drastically lower the risks of developing eye disease later in\\nlife. Innovative products like MiSight 1-day contact lenses help ensure a\\nhealthier future for myopic children. As part of the Treehouse Eyes network,\\nwe are proud to be one of the first practices in the country to be certified\\nto fit MiSight 1-day contact lenses for myopia treatment, and be part of the\\nBrilliant Futures Myopia Management Program. CooperVision, which manufactures\\nMiSight 1-day lenses, calls Brilliant Futures “the new standard of care” for\\nchildren with myopia. “It provides inclusive practice, child and parent\\nsupport to create the optimal environment for compliance, satisfaction,\\nclinical outcomes and long-term loyalty, all via a comprehensive management\\nprogram featuring MiSight 1-day daily disposable contact lenses.” What are\\nMiSight 1-Day Contact Lenses? MiSight 1-day contact lenses are soft lenses\\nthat are worn daily and disposed of after each use. A fresh pair of contacts\\nare placed into the eyes every morning to provide the child with crisp and\\nclear vision while also slowing the eye’s elongation — the source of\\nprogressive myopia. These contacts are safe and easy for children to use since\\nthey require almost no maintenance. Four different clinical trials were\\nconducted to study the safety and effectiveness of MiSight lenses over a\\n3-year span; 135 children between the ages of 8-12 participated in the trials.\\nThose who wore MiSight contacts experienced considerably less myopia\\nprogression than those who wore conventional soft contact lenses. MiSight\\n1-Day Contact Lenses: A Popular Choice CooperVision recently partnered with\\nSarah Michelle Gellar, a well-known American actress, entrepreneur and\\nproducer, to help spread awareness about the importance of myopia management\\nand annual eye exams for myopic children. The need for myopia management hit\\nhome for Gellar, who is myopic herself and has a child with myopia. “My\\nhusband and I are both nearsighted and our myopia has continued to worsen over\\ntime. We want our kids to have a chance for better vision and lower their risk\\nfor future eye health issues” explains Gellar. While regular eyeglasses or\\ncontacts help children see a whiteboard or tennis ball, “MiSight 1- day lenses\\noffer children the benefits of clear vision while slowing myopia progression\\nduring their growing years. That is why I am thrilled to be partnering with\\nCooperVision on this campaign,” Gellar says. Moreover, many parents are\\npleased to learn that MiSight 1-day contact lenses are FDA approved. In\\nNovember 2019, the lenses received FDA approval to slow myopia progression in\\nchildren who are 8-12 years old at the time of their first fitting — making\\nMiSight 1-day contact lenses the only FDA approved soft contact lenses for\\nmyopia management! We Are Proud to Be Part of the Myopia Management Movement\\nIn addition to MiSight, our highly trained and experienced doctors can offer\\nother treatment options to manage childhood myopia, including specialized\\novernight-wear contact lenses and prescription eye drops. Contact us today to\\nmake an appointment for a myopia consultation for your child. We’ll evaluate\\nyour child’s eyes and vision and recommend a personalized treatment plan that\\nwill work best for your child and your family.

GMAC, of which Treehouse Eyes is a member,\\ninvited junior racers to the go-kart track for an unexpected eye exam before\\nheading out for some fun! A recent survey of parents by the Global Myopia\\nAwareness Coalition found \\u200b\\u200b”… half of the parents reported their children\\nspent more than four hours using electronic devices each day during the\\npandemic, compared to 18% of parents reporting the same behavior prior to the\\npandemic.” Most children don’t notice anything is wrong with their vision\\nuntil it starts to really impact their activities. Eye screenings done by a\\npediatrician are important, but they don’t always pick up on myopia,\\nespecially at lower levels. This is why GMAC decided it was more important\\nthan ever to raise awareness of myopia and the treatments available. Watch the\\n“Little Kid License” video now: In the same survey mentioned above, GMAC\\ndiscovered that “… more than 70% of parents believe their pediatrician will\\nflag any issues related to their children’s eyesight and, almost the same\\namount trust that their child would say something if they had vision issues.”\\nUnfortunately, this is often not the case. But, why is this such an important\\nproblem to face? Myopia develops rapidly as children grow. Remember, your\\nchild’s eye grows like any other part of their body as they age. Since\\nchildren are prone to growth spurts, naturally their eyes are as well. Myopia\\noccurs when a child’s eyes grow too fast, leading to blurry distance vision\\nand greater risk for eye diseases later in life. We know the start of the\\nschool year is insanely busy with back-to-school activities along with the\\neveryday obligations of work and life, but it’s now more important than ever\\nto find a provider that understands how to diagnose and treat your child’s\\nmyopia. Give your child the tools they need to succeed! To schedule your\\nchild’s back-to-school eye exam, visit book an appointment or to see a list of\\nall providers near you visit Treehouse Eyes today.

October is Halloween Eye\\nSafety Month and below we have some helpful tips on how to make sure your\\nchild’s Halloween costume doesn’t leave complications for your kids vision.\\n1\\\\. Get an eye exam. Don’t be haunted by an eye infection. If you’d like to\\nobtain decorative lenses for a Halloween costume, make sure to get an eye exam\\nso your eye doctor can give the proper prescription and provide you with\\ninformation about the proper contact lens cleaning and care. 2\\\\. Get A\\nPrescription For Decorative Lenses The CDC and the American Academy of\\nOphthalmology recommend not to purchase decorative contact lenses from costume\\nshops, online stores, beauty salons, drug stores, flea markets, or anywhere\\nthat doesn’t require a prescription. Make sure to see a doctor to get lenses\\nproperly fitted, so your child isn’t at risk for vision problems such as eye\\ninfections and eye sores which can lead to permanent vision loss. Learn more\\nabout decorative lenses here. 3\\\\. Be Mindful Of Makeup Use Halloween makeup\\ncan be a fun way to enhance any costume, but it’s essential to not share\\nmakeup for the risk of eye infection.

In today’s post, your local eye exam doctor at Lumen Optometric shares\\na look at high-index lenses. Regular Lenses People suffering from refractive\\nerrors — nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism — choose to wear\\neyeglasses to correct their vision: it’s easier to wear than contact lenses,\\nnot as invasive or costly as an eye operation, and it can be fashionable.\\nEyeglasses correct refractive errors by compensating for factors such as eye\\nlength and the curvature of the cornea and lens, providing good vision.\\nSometimes a person’s vision may require strong eyeglass prescriptions that\\nrequire thicker lenses. Most eyeglass wearers are nearsighted, which requires\\nlenses that are thinner at the center than at the edges. The stronger the\\nprescription, the thicker the edges will be, which can result in heavy lenses.\\nThis can limit one’s options in terms of eyewear selection, as one may need to\\nstick to thicker frames to hold their lenses. Wearing contact lenses might not\\nbe an option for some people. High-Index Lenses Many of today’s eye care\\ncenters offer high-index lenses as an option. They provide the same level of\\nrefractive correction as regular lenses but are much thinner. High-index\\nlenses offer the following benefits: Thinner and lighter — High-index lenses\\nhave thinner edges even at high power, which opens up a wider selection of\\nframe styles for you. Lighter lenses also make it easy to wear, even for\\nprolonged periods. Aesthetically pleasing — One reason why some people dislike\\nwearing glasses is that high-power lenses tend to look like the bottom of a\\nsoda bottle, colloquially called “Coke bottle glasses,” which makes the eyes\\nlook smaller (for nearsighted prescriptions) or larger (for farsighted\\nprescriptions). High-index lenses are “aspheric,” — that is, less rounded —\\nthan regular lenses, which means even high-power lenses won’t distort your\\nfacial features.

January 22, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Your child’s\\nacademic performance highly depends on their sight. 80% of learning occurs\\nthrough vision, meaning eye problems can hinder your little one’s ability to\\ndo well in school. Moreover, many young kids aren’t aware they have issues\\nwith their vision or don’t complain of symptoms. That’s why regular\\nappointments with your local eye doctor matter. A local scleral optometrist\\nshares how poor vision can affect children’s learning. Difficulty Focusing\\nMyopia or nearsightedness is a common refractive error in children.\\nIndividuals with this eye condition can find it difficult to see distant\\nobjects. If your child is nearsighted, they might struggle to see the text on\\nthe board, which can cause them to lose focus. Their grades could suffer when\\nthey can’t concentrate on and understand their teacher’s instructions. If\\nyou’ve noticed that your child keeps squinting or holding reading materials\\ntoo closely to their face, schedule a visit with your eye doctor immediately.\\nOnly eye specialists can confirm if they are nearsighted and require\\nprescription glasses. At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to assist with your\\nfamily’s eye care needs. Aside from contact lenses and glasses, we offer dry\\neye treatment. Poor Reading Comprehension Vision issues can impact a child’s\\nreading comprehension skills. The eyes must work harmoniously to move across\\nthe page, recognize letters and understand the text. It isn’t uncommon for\\nchildren with vision-related learning problems to get confused with similar-\\nlooking letters, shapes and words because they can’t see the figures properly.\\nCompromised Hand-Eye Coordination Several studies have shown that exercise\\nduring school days can improve academic performance. If your little one\\ndoesn’t like playing outside with other kids or tends to shy away from\\nactivities that require distant vision, there’s a chance that they have\\nproblems with their sight. Your child won’t be able to enjoy the benefits of\\nphysical activity on their cognitive and motor skills if they don’t exercise\\nduring the day. At Lumen Optometric, we are here to help you reach your\\nchild’s fullest potential by providing reliable eye care services. Our team\\nspecializes in myopia management. We also offer neurolens treatment and\\northokeratology. Call us at (626) 921-0199 or complete our online form to\\nrequest an appointment.

They can give you a more natural look than eyeglasses and are\\ngenerally safe to wear as long as you care for them properly. Many first-time\\nwearers tend to find it challenging to put in and remove their contacts. Put\\nin and take out your contacts easily using these helpful tips. How to Put in\\nYour Contacts Before handling your contacts, wash and dry your hands. Failing\\nto do so heightens the risk of eye infections and corneal ulcers from bacteria\\nexposure. Wash your hands using soap and warm water to ensure they are clean.\\nMoreover, avoid drying your hands with cloths or towels with lint. Go in front\\nof a mirror and stand on a flat surface. If there’s a sink below you, make\\nsure to plug the drain. To avoid confusion, make it a habit to put in the same\\nlens first. Place your contacts on the tip of your index or middle finger of\\nyour dominant hand. Inspect your lenses for scratches or damaged areas. If\\nyour lens forms a blow and the edges turn up, it means it’s in the correct\\nposition. Hold your upper lid open with your non-dominant hand while in front\\nof a mirror, and hold down your lower lid with the ring finger of your\\ndominant hand. It’s now time to put the lens in your eye, which you should do\\nwhile looking at the ceiling. To allow your lens to get in place, shut your\\neyes and roll them in a circular motion. Open your eyes and blink a couple of\\ntimes. Check your eyes in the mirror to see if the contacts are in the center\\nof your eyes. You’ll know your lenses are in the right position if you’re\\ncomfortable and seeing clearly. If not, take out the lenses and reinsert them.\\nRepeat the same procedure to your other eye once you’ve successfully put in\\nthe first lens. How to Take Them Out Again, make sure your hands are clean and\\ndry before touching your contacts. Remove any leftover contact lens solution\\nfrom the case and allow them to dry or dry with a clean cloth. Get in front of\\na mirror and gaze up. Pull your lower lid down using the middle finger of your\\ndominant hand. It helps to take off the same lens first to save yourself from\\nconfusion. Gently push the lens down to the white of your eye using the index\\nfinger of your dominant hand. Carefully pinch the lens with your index\\nfinger’s pads and thumb to take it off your eye. Do the same procedure to\\nremove the lens from your other eye. Need to upgrade your contact lens\\nprescription? Lumen Optometric has options for different vision correction\\nneeds.

However, too much of it can harm\\nvarious parts of your body, including your eyes. It can also affect your\\ncurrent and future eye health and vision. Continue reading to learn how\\nalcohol affects your eyes and vision from a local scleral optometrist. What\\nDoes Alcohol Do to Your Eyes? Moderate drinkers should expect the effects of\\nalcohol to wear off after a while, especially if they take proper care of\\ntheir bodies after drinking. After going out for drinks with your friends,\\nmake sure to drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated. It’s also important\\nto get sufficient rest and sleep. Meanwhile, heavy drinkers are at risk of\\nvision changes and even permanent eye damage. If you drink a lot in a single\\nday, you may experience dizziness and blurry vision. Making heavy drinking a\\nhabit is never a good idea because there is a close correlation between the\\nliver and the eyes. Every organ in your body is related, a reason why you\\nshould focus on your holistic health. It’s essential to get regular health\\nchecks and eye exams to keep track of your overall health. At Lumen\\nOptometric, we offer comprehensive eye exams and dry eye treatment. Excessive\\nDrinking and Your Vision Over time, drinking too much alcohol can cause brain\\ndamage. If your brain does not function properly, your vision may also suffer.\\nYou may have permanently blurred vision or double vision due to the weakening\\nof eye muscles. When this happens, your reaction time may also decrease.\\nExcessive drinking also compromises your peripheral vision and causes you to\\ndevelop tunnel vision. This condition can make driving difficult because your\\neyes can’t react well to headlights. Another thing that alcohol can damage is\\nyour ability to distinguish contrast in colors. Moreover, too much drinking\\nmay also result in optic neuropathy, migraines, and rapid eye movements. At\\nLumen Optometric, we’re more than happy to assist with your eye care needs. We\\noffer a wide range of services, including myopia management, orthokeratology,\\nand neurolens treatment. Call us at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our contact\\nform to schedule an appointment.

Women are particularly\\nvulnerable to cataracts due to hormonal changes. As of writing this article,\\nthe only treatment for cataracts is surgery. During cataract surgery, the\\ndoctor will remove the cloudy lens and replace them with an intraocular lens\\nor IOL. The exact cause of cataracts may be unknown, but many experts believe\\nthat oxidative stress can damage enzymes and proteins in the eye’s natural\\nlens. As such, the best way to reduce cataract risks is to eat a healthy diet\\nthat consists of antioxidant chemicals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole\\ngrains. Lumen Optometric, a top provider of corneal reshaping services,\\nrecommends adding these foods to your everyday menu. Fruits and Vegetables\\nAccording to research, you need five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables\\neach day for optimal eye health. Choose organic fruits and vegetables. When\\neating them as is or adding them as an ingredient for meals, leave the skins\\non, as they are full of vitamins A, C, and E as well as lutein and zeaxanthin.\\nFruits and vegetables offer the highest total antioxidant capacity, so be sure\\nto include them in your regular meals. Fish Another way to reduce the risk of\\ncataracts is by eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. This includes\\nseafood such as shrimp, tuna, salmon, and trout. If your eye exam doctor tells\\nyou that you are at risk for cataract development, you can slow the\\nprogression by eating fish at least twice each week. This way, you nourish\\nyour eyes and protect your vision. Whole Grains Having three servings of 100%\\nwhole grains daily is a great way to prevent cataracts. This may include\\namaranth, quinoa, sorghum, or millet. While these grains seem unfamiliar to\\nyou, research some recipes and add something new to your diet. In addition to\\nthat, you should also read food labels carefully. Avoid white bread and bakery\\nitems that may contain refined grains and sugars and select minimally\\nprocessed items. Nuts and Seeds Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects\\nmembranes of eye cells from radical damage. A few foods, including cooking\\noils, seeds and nuts, are exceptionally rich sources. Preserve the health of\\nyour eyes with the help of Lumen Optometric. In addition to comprehensive eye\\nexams, we also provide prescription glasses and contact lenses.

June 1, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Introduction: As\\nparents, one of the key concerns regarding our children’s vision is\\nunderstanding how long myopia management is necessary. We often wonder when\\nmyopia progression might come to a halt and whether interventions are required\\nindefinitely. In this blog post, we’ll explore this question and shed light on\\nthe factors influencing the duration of myopia management. Understanding the\\nAge of Myopia Stabilization: A crucial aspect of determining the duration of\\nmyopia management is identifying the age at which myopia tends to stop\\nprogressing. However, this age can vary significantly among individuals and is\\ninfluenced by various factors. These factors include the age of myopia onset,\\nthe intensity of near work, parental history of myopia, and lifestyle factors.\\nFactors Influencing Myopia Stabilization: The age of myopia onset plays a\\nsignificant role in predicting when myopia is likely to stabilize. Generally,\\nearlier onset of myopia is associated with a higher likelihood of continued\\nprogression into adulthood. Additionally, the intensity of near work, such as\\nprolonged hours spent studying or engaging in screen activities, can impact\\nmyopia progression. Parental history of myopia also serves as a crucial\\nindicator. Children with one or both myopic parents are at a higher risk of\\ndeveloping and progressing myopia. These genetic factors contribute to the\\noverall prognosis and duration of myopia management. Understanding Ocular\\nGrowth Charts: Ocular growth charts provide valuable insights into the\\nprojected age of stabilization for myopia. However, it’s essential to\\nrecognize that these projections assume relatively stable visual and lifestyle\\nconditions. In reality, significant changes in visual demand can trigger a\\nsecond phase of myopia progression even after years of stable presentation.\\nConclusion: In conclusion, the duration of myopia management for your child\\ndepends on various factors, including the age of myopia onset, intensity of\\nnear work, parental history of myopia, and lifestyle factors. While ocular\\ngrowth charts offer insights into the projected age of stabilization, it’s\\ncrucial to consider the dynamic nature of myopia progression, especially in\\nresponse to changes in visual demand. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re dedicated to\\nproviding personalized myopia management strategies tailored to your child’s\\nunique needs, ensuring optimal vision health for years to come.

October 7, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Your eyeglasses or contact\\nlenses may seem like they’re still working perfectly, but they probably aren’t\\nif you’ve had them for a while. In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses\\nhow often you should have your eye prescription updated. How Often Should You\\nUpdate Your Eye Prescription? People have different eye care needs. Some need\\nto have their eye prescription changed annually, while others won’t need to\\nupdate theirs every three years. If you’ve been keeping up with routine\\nappointments with your eye doctor, you’d already have an idea of how often you\\nshould update your eye prescription. Some factors affect how often a person\\nshould see their eye exam doctor and have their prescription updated. For many\\npeople, age and genetics are two such factors: if you have a family member who\\nneeds to update their prescription regularly, chances are you’ll be needing\\nthe same. Lifestyle is also another factor. For example, if you have a job\\nthat requires constantly facing a screen, eye strain can affect your vision\\nover the long term. Signs That You Need to Update Your Eye Prescription\\nRegular visits to your eye doctor can help determine how often you should\\nupdate your prescription. The pandemic has made it difficult for people to see\\ntheir eye doctor, but if you haven’t had an eye exam even before the\\nquarantines began, then you should see one as soon as possible — even more so\\nif you’re experiencing one or more of the following: You’re having frequent\\nheadaches. Pain behind or around the eyes is a warning sign that your brain is\\ntrying to compensate for the change in your vision. While resting your eyes\\nand taking pain medication can provide temporary relief, updating your eye\\nprescription is a better long-term solution. You’re often squinting. Squinting\\ncan help focus your vision and bring clarity. However, you shouldn’t have to —\\nnot with an updated eye prescription. You’re having trouble reading signs from\\na distance. If your daily routine includes tasks that depend on clear vision\\nsuch as driving, then an outdated prescription may put you at risk.

They occur when\\nthe shape of your eye prevents light from focusing correctly on your retina,\\nor the light-sensitive tissue layer found in the back of your eye. More than\\nfive million Americans suffer from refractive errors, impacting their quality\\nof life. But the good news is that this vision problem can be corrected. The\\npremier optometrist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares a quick overview of\\ndifferent refractive error types and their treatment. 1\\\\. Myopia. Also called\\n‘nearsightedness’, this particular refractive error makes it hard for people\\nto see far-away objects. Myopia happens when the eye is too long in the back,\\nor when there’s a problem with the shape of the cornea (the clear front layer\\nof the eyes) or the lens (the inner part of the eye that helps with focusing).\\n2\\\\. Hyperopia. To those with hyperopia, or ‘farsightedness”, nearby objects\\nwill appear blurry. This refractive error happens when the eyeball grows too\\nshort from front to back, or when the cornea or lens has a different shape\\nthan normal. Unlike those who suffer from myopia, which may develop in\\npatients between the ages of 6 and 14, people with hyperopia are usually born\\nwith this vision problem. 3\\\\. Astigmatism. When a person has astigmatism,\\nthey’ll have trouble seeing both far-away and nearby objects clearly. This is\\ncaused by a differently-shaped cornea or lens, which makes light bend\\ndifferently as it enters the eye. 4\\\\. Presbyopia. This type of refractive\\nerror affects middle-aged and older adults. Presbyopia is an age-related\\nvision problem that makes it hard for people to see things up close because\\nthe eye lenses have become harder and less flexible, preventing light from\\nfocusing properly on the retina. How Refractive Errors are Treated Before a\\nrefractive error can be corrected, it has to be diagnosed accurately during a\\ncomprehensive eye exam performed by a trusted eye care professional like Lumen\\nOptometric. Once the vision problem is diagnosed, it may be corrected using\\nprescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Myopia and hyperopia may also be\\nfixed without the benefit of eyeglasses or contacts through orthokeratology.\\nThis safe, FDA-approved and non-surgical treatment involves the use of custom\\nlenses that gently reshape the eyes as you sleep. Ask us more about this\\nparticular solution and determine whether this will be a viable option for\\nyou.

Whether you have a normal eye condition or you\\nhave existing eye conditions or a risk for certain eye conditions, the\\nfollowing tips from Neurolens treatment specialist Lumen Optometric will\\nsurely help give you peace of mind whenever you need to drive in the evening:\\nNight Driving Glasses If you’re having difficulty driving at night, you can\\nask your eye care specialist to prescribe special night driving glasses that\\ncan help you see better on the road. This type of glasses usually has a yellow\\ntint and anti-reflective coating. Also, lenses made with wavefront diagnostic\\ntechnology can reduce glare, halos, starbursts and other aberrations that can\\ndistract your vision. Regular Eye Checkup Make sure to have your eyes checked\\nby a specialist at least once every two years. If you have a significant eye\\ncondition or you have trouble with your eyes or vision, you may have to visit\\nyour eye doctor more frequently. Don’t hesitate to go for a checkup if you\\nexperience vision problems on the road at night. Your doctor may recommend\\nthat you take specialized testing, such as an evaluation of your visual field\\nor contrast sensitivity, to determine what’s wrong and what can be done to\\nimprove your condition. Also, don’t neglect any treatments prescribed to you.\\nIf you need dry eye treatment or treatment of an eye disease, make sure to\\nfollow your doctor’s instructions. Other Tips Below are other simple ways to\\nhelp ensure your safety while driving at night: Always keep your car windows\\nclear so that you can have a good view of the road.Do not drive if you are\\ntired or stressed. Driving requires focus. If you are already exhausted or\\ndealing with several distractions, it would be better to have someone else\\ndrive instead.Plan your trips, especially if you will be going on a long\\ndrive. As much as possible, stick to roads that you are familiar with and\\navoid dark, unlighted streets and risky spots.

It does\\nnot only strengthen and improve one’s physical abilities; it can also help\\nboost a person’s mental sharpness, emotional health, and social skills. But\\ndue to the nature of various kinds of sports, risks of injuries are always\\npresent. One example of this is the risk of eye injury. That said, it is\\nimportant to have the right gear and protective eyewear to keep your eyes\\nsafe. This is true for anyone, whether you are wearing glasses or contact\\nlenses or not. By wearing the right eye protection, you can save yourself from\\neye injuries such as corneal abrasion, detached retina, eye socket fracture,\\nand hyphema. Polycarbonate lenses are usually recommended for protective\\nsports eyewear because they are impact-resistant and shatterproof. They are\\nalso thinner and lighter than plastic and provide UV protection. Make sure\\nthat the polycarbonate lenses that you use meet or exceed the current sport-\\nspecific ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International\\nstandards. In this post, corneal reshaping expert Lumen Optometric shares tips\\non how you can protect your eyes when playing different sports. Baseball and\\nSoftball Use helmet-mounted faceguards that are approved by the National\\nOperating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE). Eye guards\\nlike goggles or spectacles are also recommended to minimize injury in case of\\na ball impact. Sports eye guards should be approved to ASTM F803-19 or the\\nmost current standard. Football Use a faceguard with a polycarbonate visor\\nshield. The shield will protect against objects that can potentially penetrate\\nopenings in the faceguard grid. Soccer Use sports eye guards that have ASTM\\nF803-19 approval. Basketball Use sports eye guards like goggles or spectacles\\nthat are approved to ASTM F803-19. Field Hockey Use sports eye guards that are\\napproved to ASTM F2713-18 or the most current standard. If you’re looking for\\nan eye exam doctor, Lumen Optometric has a team of eye specialists who will\\nensure the best care for you.

A dry eye treatment specialist\\nshares some tips here. Preparing Is the First Step The first thing you should\\ndo to incorporate good eye care into your active lifestyle is to prepare ahead\\nof time. Get a travel pouch that fits your contacts, solution, gels, etc. Do\\nnot forget to pack eye drops that can alleviate itchiness during the hayfever\\nseason or dryness caused by heavy air conditioning. Consider Switching to\\nDisposable Contacts Sometimes, using weekly or even monthly contact lenses\\ndoes not make it easy to live your active lifestyle, especially if preparing\\ntravel kits is not your thing. If this is the case, bring up the idea of\\nswitching to contact lenses that you can dispose of daily with your optician.\\nHowever, this might not be a fitting option if you use scleral or other\\nspecialty lenses, says a scleral optometrist. Bring Your Sunglasses\\nOverexposure to ultraviolet rays can lead to a host of eye-related issues like\\ncataracts or corneal sunburn, so it is important to take the right precautions\\nto safeguard your vision from damage. Having a pair of sunglasses with you\\nduring travels is just as essential as having all your eye care accessories.\\nSure, contact lenses do provide protection against UVA and UVB, but unlike\\nsunglasses, they do not fully cover your eyes including the skin on your lids.\\nLumen Optometric is a premier eye care center specializing in contacts and\\neyeglasses, neurolens treatment, dry eye treatment, myopia control and more.\\nGive us a call at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our online form to schedule an\\nappointment.

In\\ntoday’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses what causes dry eye syndrome, and how\\nyou can manage it if it happens to you. What Is Dry Eye Syndrome? Dry eye\\nsyndrome is characterized by dryness around the eyes, which may be accompanied\\nby irritation, inflammation, or blurred vision. Anyone can experience these\\nsymptoms, however, discomfort is more pronounced for people who wear contact\\nlenses, as lack of moisture increases friction between the eyes and the\\nlenses. Dryness is usually caused by hormone changes, some autoimmune\\nconditions, or damage to the tear glands or the skin around the eyes. Advanced\\nage and certain types of allergies may also contribute to dry eye syndrome.\\nSome types of contact lenses, when worn for long periods, can also cause\\ndryness in the eyes. Managing Dry Eye Syndrome If you’re experiencing symptoms\\nof dry eye syndrome, do not take any medication or try how-tos that you may\\nfind online. Visit an eye exam doctor to determine its cause and plan\\ntreatment. One of the most common treatments for dry eye syndrome is taking\\nlubricating eye drops, which are often prescribed for dryness caused by\\ninefficient tear glands or very low humidity levels. If dryness is determined\\nto be caused by the medication that you’re taking, your eye doctor may require\\nchanges to your prescription. Choose the Right Contact Lenses If dryness\\noccurs when you wear your contact lenses, you don’t have to limit its usage or\\nswitch to eyeglasses if you’re not comfortable wearing one. The following are\\nother types of contact lenses that are more suitable for people suffering from\\ndry eye syndrome: Soft Contact Lenses — These contacts are made of hydrogel,\\nwhich contains water. Soft contact lenses are typically disposable, however,\\nsome manufacturers offer extended-wear options that are reusable for up to 30\\ndays. Silicone-Based Hydrogel Contact Lenses — These are functionally similar\\nto hydrogel-based contact lenses, but have better moisture retention. Gas-\\nPermeable Contact Lenses — These contacts are relatively more rigid, but they\\nlet oxygen reach the eye. Orthokeratology contact lenses are made from a\\nsimilar material. If you are experiencing symptoms of dry eye syndrome, call\\nLumen Optometric at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our contact form to schedule an\\nappointment.

However, by making a few\\nlifestyle changes, you can lower your risk for these conditions. This Healthy\\nAging Month, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, shares tips on\\ntaking care of your aging eyes. Eat a Balanced Diet Make sure to include in\\nyour diet foods rich in eye-friendly nutrients, such as Vitamin A (which helps\\nprotect the cornea, the surface of your eye) and Vitamin E (which prevent free\\nradicals from damaging proteins in your eyes). Should You Take Supplements?\\nSupplements can help prevent vitamin deficiencies, but they’re not a\\nsubstitute for a balanced diet. If you’re considering taking supplements,\\nconsult your eye doctor. Undergo Routine Eye Exams How often should you have\\nyour eyes checked? As a general rule, those aged 40 and above should see their\\neye doctor at least once a year. What many patients don’t realize is that they\\ndon’t usually notice that their vision has deteriorated unless the change is\\nabrupt or significant. That’s because your brain automatically adapts to any\\nchanges in your vision, sometimes tricking you into thinking there’s nothing\\nwrong with your vision even though it has already deteriorated. Through\\nroutine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect changes in your vision before\\nthey significantly affect your lifestyle and prescribe treatment. For\\ninstance, they might give you a higher prescription for your contact lenses.\\nWear Sunglasses Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays can damage your vision\\nand increase your risk for conditions such as cataracts or macular\\ndegeneration. To protect your eyes from UV damage, always wear sunglasses\\nwhile you’re outside. In particular, we recommend wearing sunglasses with a\\nshade of UV 400, which provide nearly 100% protection from UV rays.

That’s why parents are doing whatever they can to help\\ntheir children successfully transition to the next academic grade. Below, we\\nshare our top tips for parents, so they can ensure that their child’s vision\\nis a tool for success in school. 1\\\\. Balance Indoor and Outdoor Time Outdoor\\nplay offers numerous benefits, but many children aren’t getting enough of it.\\nMost children spend much of their time indoors, whether in a classroom, at\\nhome, or in after-school activities. Kids who regularly play outdoors have\\nimproved motor skills, feel more independent, and practice important social\\nskills. But the main benefit of “outdoor time” that eye doctors like to focus\\non is the lower incidence of myopia (where distant objects appear blurry).\\nNumerous studies published in journals like Ophthalmic Research and Review Of\\nOptometry have shown that children who spend 1.5-2.5 hours per day outdoors\\nduring the daytime have a reduced risk of becoming myopic or, if they have\\nmyopia, it progresses at a slower pace. Sending your kids outside to play\\nevery day will help their vision, overall health, and contribute to academic\\nsuccess. 2\\\\. Encourage Your Child To Take Frequent Breaks Once the new school\\nyear begins, students are often busy with daily homework, reading assignments,\\nand visually demanding recreational activities like video games. While all of\\nthese activities are important, they shouldn’t be done without periodic\\nbreathers. Eye strain is a real concern for the many students who spend hours\\nin front of a book or screen and can put a damper on their grades. Minimally,\\nhave your child follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes they should focus\\nfor 20 seconds on an object that’s at least 20 feet away. Even better,\\nencourage slightly longer breaks for a snack in the sun, or a quick walk\\naround the block to allow their eyes to focus on more distant objects. 3\\\\.\\nHave Their Eyes Examined by an Optometrist Whether or not your child wears\\nglasses, yearly eye exams will help ensure healthy visual development. It’s no\\nsurprise that children who don’t see well perform at a lower level than their\\npeers. In some cases, young children aren’t even aware that their vision has\\nchanged, or they may not be able to verbally express it. At our practice, our\\neye exams go far beyond the standard vision screenings offered in school. We\\nthoroughly check your child’s eye health and several visual skills, including\\nvisual acuity, focusing, tracking and teaming. If your child has myopia we\\nwill discuss if they are a candidate for myopia management. Myopia management\\ntreatments can slow or stop myopia in children and teens and doing so will\\nminimize their risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life. 4\\\\.\\nFilter Out Blue Light Now, more than ever, children’s eyes are focusing on\\nscreens of all shapes and sizes. While science hasn’t yet confirmed the\\ndamaging effects of blue light on a child’s eyes, one thing is certain: blue\\nlight exposure (especially in the evening) can lead to reduced sleep quality.\\nGood-quality sleep is crucial for cognitive and physical development, which is\\nwhy many parents purchase blue light glasses or utilize blue light filters\\nsuch as screens and software on devices. Blue light also contributes to\\ndigital eye strain, leading to symptoms like eye pain, headaches, blurred\\nvision and dry eyes. If your child uses a tablet, smartphone, or computer\\nbefore bedtime, speak with us about whether blue light glasses or lens\\ncoatings can help. Give your child the tools they need to succeed!

January 17, 2024 by Lumen\\nOptometric Around 80 million people around the world have glaucoma.\\nInterestingly, around half of the individuals with this eye problem aren’t\\neven aware of it. This condition often shows no symptoms in its initial\\nstages. It’s frequently called “sneak of the sight” because when not detected\\nand treated early, it can cause irreversible vision loss. Learn if glaucoma is\\npreventable from your local orthokeratology specialist. What Is Glaucoma?\\nGlaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve or the nerve\\nin the back of the eye. Its symptoms are usually not noticeable in its early\\nstages. People often only notice changes in their vision once the condition\\nhas progressed. The only way to confirm if you have glaucoma is to get a\\ncomprehensive eye exam. While it has no cure, early treatment can help\\npreserve your sight. Who Are at Risk? You can get glaucoma, regardless of your\\nethnicity and age. However, it’s more common in people over 60, African\\nAmericans over 60, and those with a family history of glaucoma. If you are at\\nhigh risk of this eye condition, you might need to see your eye exam doctor\\nevery one to two years. Is It Preventable? While glaucoma isn’t preventable,\\nit can be caught early through regular eye exams. Early detection and\\ntreatment go a long way in preventing significant or permanent vision loss.\\nEating nourishing meals has also been proven to be beneficial to eye health.\\nInclude leafy greens, colored fruits, berries and vegetables in your diet.\\nRegular exercise can lower eye pressure, which is helpful for people with\\nglaucoma. Even low-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is ideal for\\nglaucoma patients. Quitting smoking and wearing UV-blocking sunglasses are\\nother ways to protect your eyes from the effects of this vision-threatening\\neye condition. If you experience sudden vision changes, don’t wait long to\\nschedule an eye exam. At Lumen Optometric, we provide more than prescription\\neyeglasses and contact lenses.

July 14,\\n2020 by Lumen Optometric COVID-19 has changed the way people move and interact\\nin public spaces, influencing our personal hygiene and habits. For contact\\nlens wearers, the “new normal” has put a question on their use of contacts.\\nWhile contact lenses are generally a safe and effective form of vision\\ncorrection for many people, concerns have grown as to whether it’s OK to\\ncontinue using these lenses or not amid the pandemic. Since contact lenses are\\ninserted and removed using one’s fingers, wouldn’t this pose a higher risk of\\ncoronavirus infection? According to recent research, there is no sufficient\\nevidence suggesting that contact lens wearers have a higher risk of\\ncontracting COVID-19. Experts have also emphasized the importance of proper\\nhandwashing and good hygiene in order to prevent or reduce such risks. Lumen\\nOptometric, a trusted expert in eye care and dry eye treatment, shares more\\ntips below. Observe Proper Handwashing Before handling your contact lenses,\\nmake sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20\\nseconds. Afterwards, dry your hands with a clean towel or unused paper towels.\\nIf soap and water are not available, you can use a hand sanitizer containing\\nat least 60% of alcohol. Regularly Disinfect Contact Lenses Your scleral\\noptometrist will also likely advise you to regularly disinfect your contacts\\nif they are monthly or two-week lenses. Make sure to follow the cleaning\\ninstructions of the manufacturer or your eye doctor. If you have disposable\\nlenses, get rid of them properly every after use. Discontinue Wearing Contacts\\nand Switch to Glasses if Sick If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms or\\nyou have tested positive for COVID-19, it would be best to stop using your\\ncontacts and switch to glasses for the meantime. Take note, however, that\\nwearing glasses cannot protect you against COVID-19 or prevent transmissions\\nof the virus. Lumen Optometric is a local practice that offers top-notch eye\\ncare services. From eye exams to Neurolens treatment, we can ensure a\\npersonalized approach to your eye concerns. Call us at (626) 921-0199 or fill\\nout our contact form to request an appointment.

A myopic eye is one that grows too\\nlong front to back. We know this because we measure it using special equipment\\nthat calculates the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back\\n(retina). This distance is known as the axial length, and with advanced\\nequipment we can now measure this down to fractions of a millimeter. So myopia\\nis an abnormal elongation of the eye – if a normal eye is shaped like a\\nbasketball, then a myopic eye would more resemble a football. Portrait of boy\\nworking on team project in art class Once an eye is too long, there are\\ncurrently no known treatments or cures which can cause the axial length of the\\neye to reverse. Refractive surgery performed on adults, such as LASIK, does\\nnot “shrink” the eye, but rather reshapes the front surface of the cornea to\\nenable clear vision without corrective lenses. While the patient who has\\nsuccessful refractive surgery can now see clearly, they still have an\\nelongated eye, so still have the risks associated with the disease. The\\nDangers of Having Myopia There are different types of myopia as well. If a\\nchild develops myopia at a young age, we know that they are at higher risk to\\ndevelop high myopia and even pathological levels of myopia. High levels of\\nmyopia can lead to an increased risk for diseases of the eye such as retinal\\ndetachments, glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy. Unfortunately, those diseases\\ncan all lead to permanent vision loss. These life-altering diseases are\\nanother layer of danger besides the obvious need for optical correction in\\nglasses or contact lenses in order to see clearly. When you have pathological\\nor degenerative myopia, other signs can form on your eyes that your eye doctor\\nneeds to monitor over time. Lattice degeneration and lacquer cracks of the\\nretina all show signs that the retina is under duress because the eyeball has\\ngrown excessively long. Ask your doctor about these signs and other ones such\\nas a tilted optic nerve head disc and choroidal neovascularization that happen\\nexponentially higher in cases of extremely high levels of myopia. What are the\\nBest Ways to Treat Myopia? The best treatment is to first prevent myopia if\\npossible. More research is being conducted in this area, but as a general\\nrule, eye doctors are encouraging at least two hours of outdoor activity per\\nday. More outdoor activities under natural sunlight have been associated with\\na lower risk of developing myopia in the first place. If your children have to\\ndo intense studying or reading, it is recommended to do as much reading as\\npossible when the sun has set versus reading during the day. Regular checkups\\nwith your eye doctor to diagnose myopia as early as possible are also\\ncritical. By catching myopia at an early age, there can be many different\\ntypes of interventions to prevent myopia from worsening. Myopia typically\\nbegins in school-aged children and can worsen until the leveling out usually\\nin your mid-twenties. As far as the visual component is concerned, usually, a\\npair of glasses or contact lenses are sufficient. Once the eyes have stopped\\ngrowing, refractive surgery procedures can be employed as well. But keep in\\nmind that simply correcting your vision will not stop your eyes from getting\\nworse. The root cause of myopia, an eyeball that continues to grow excessively\\nlong during our youth, needs to be addressed. Special pharmaceutical agents\\nsuch as atropine have been shown to slow down the progression of myopia\\nconsiderably. Special contacts such as orthokeratology lenses worn at night\\nare effective as well. Even soft contact lenses and glasses designed with\\nspecial optics different from the traditional pair of glasses can be effective\\nto slow down the rate of myopic progression. Custom Orthokeratology or\\nOvernight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed\\ncontact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while\\nsleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names\\nfor orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping\\nsystem, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the\\ncurvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While\\ninitially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see\\nmore clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in\\nreducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused\\nin front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the\\noptical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact\\nlenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning and\\ndisinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper\\nhygiene ‘ortho-k’ is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating\\nchildren of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that\\ncan be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to\\ntreat children with amblyopia, sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used\\nto dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What\\nwe’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine\\ncan also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is\\nstill little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye\\nto reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the\\naxial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic\\nprogression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are\\nbeing designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight\\ncontact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia\\nby almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers\\nthroughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral\\nretina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact\\nlens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia\\nas well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating\\nEyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a\\nsimilar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is\\na particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact\\nlenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s\\nbodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of\\npower in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial\\nlength elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good\\nnews is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids—just like\\nyours—so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above\\nare four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been\\ndiagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with\\na contact lens while sleeping. Atropine involves an eye drop that can signal\\nthe eye to grow a little slower. Custom soft multifocal lenses are worn during\\nthe day. And even specially designed glasses are on the horizon to improve the\\nprogression of myopia. The Treehouse Eyes eye doctors use state-of-the-art\\nequipment to develop a personalized treatment plan for your child.

January 1, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Routine visits to the\\neye doctor are necessary for maintaining the good health of your eyes. If you\\nfeel that there is something wrong with your vision or experiencing discomfort\\nin your eyes, you must consult a specialist immediately. You can either go to\\nan optometrist or an ophthalmologist if you have issues with your eyes. Read\\non to discover which eye exam doctor you should visit for your eye condition.\\nOptometrists VS Ophthalmologists An optometrist attends optometry school for\\nfour years and usually do a year of residency. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist\\ngoes to medical school for four years and does a four-year residency. Also, an\\nophthalmologist typically does a fellowship for one to two years. They can\\nchoose a specialty like glaucoma or pediatrics. Ophthalmologists will have an\\nMD or DO following their name while optometrists will have an OD after their\\nnames. Who Should You Go To? Both optometrists and ophthalmologists can\\nprescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses. The main difference between the two\\nprofessions is that an ophthalmologist performs surgeries while optometrists\\ndon’t. Ophthalmologists are surgeons who can also treat eye diseases. States\\nmay indicate which conditions optometrists can treat while ophthalmologists\\ncan treat all eye diseases. For eye exams and prescriptions, you can go to\\nboth eye doctors. Usually, an optometrist is the better option for those who\\nneed more contacts. On the other hand, those who need surgeries should consult\\nan ophthalmologist. It’s the same for serious conditions like macular\\ndegeneration and diabetic retinopathy. For your eye care needs, you can depend\\non Lumen Optometric.

Both organizations now recommend\\nchildren play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia, and support\\nproactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye\\ndisease risk associated with higher myopia later in life. What is Myopia?\\nMyopia causes blurry distance vision, which can be compensated for with\\nglasses or contact lenses to provide a child with clear vision. However,\\nmyopia is caused by an eye that is growing too long and, once started, myopia\\nusually gets worse in children as the eye continues to grow abnormally fast.\\nHigher myopia increases the lifetime risk of serious eye diseases such as\\nretinal diseases and glaucoma. How Bad is the Myopia epidemic? In late 2019,\\nthe American Academy of Ophthalmology created a Task Force on Myopia,\\nrecognizing the importance of this growing disease in children and the\\npotential lifelong impact myopia has on individuals and society. This task\\nforce identified priorities of educating other physicians, working with\\ngovernment agencies and health agencies, and educating parents and schools\\nabout this issue so that more proactive steps can be taken to help children.\\nTreehouse Eyes Co-founder, Matt Oerding, was recently interviewed about the\\nprevalence of myopia alongside Dr. William Reynolds of the American Optometric\\nAssociation and Dr. Emily McCourt, the chief of ophthalmology at Children’s\\nHospital Colorado.” Over the last two decades, there’s been an increase in\\nmyopia or nearsightedness worldwide, not just in the United States. And that\\ncorresponds with an increase in near devices, especially digital devices,”\\nReynolds said. Watch the full interview by clicking here. Myopia incidence is\\nrising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as\\nreading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global\\nphenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates\\nstate half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050. Can Myopia be\\nStopped? There is hope for parents, however, as several treatments are now\\navailable that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children.\\nThese treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription\\neye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s\\nvision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye\\ndoctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good\\ncandidate for treatment.

It’s estimated that the 700,000 workplace eye injuries that\\nhappen every year cost businesses roughly $934 million in combined\\nproductivity loss, health costs, fines, and employee compensation.

Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam\\ndoctor, shares eye care tips below: Remind Employees to Observe the 20-20-20\\nRule While using a computer, you should take short breaks to allow your eye\\nmuscles to rest. Every 20 minutes, employees should look at an object at least\\n20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Avoid Sitting Too Close to the Computer\\nScreen A common myth is that you can develop myopia (nearsightedness) or\\nhyperopia (farsightedness) if you sit too close to the screen. However, this\\nmyth has been debunked by the fact the two vision conditions have strong\\ngenetic links. While sitting close to the screen won’t cause nearsightedness\\nor farsightedness, it can increase digital eye strain. To prevent digital eye\\nstrain, the computer screen should be about 20 to 28 inches away from the\\nface. However, if employees keep moving closer to the screen to see better,\\nthey should see an eye specialist as soon as possible. That’s because they may\\nneed a higher prescription for their eyeglasses or contact lenses. Adjust the\\nComputer’s Display Settings Another way to reduce digital eye strain is to\\nadjust the computer’s display settings to make it easier for your eyes to\\nfollow the text and see images. Adjust the computer display’s brightness to\\nthe same level as your workplace’s brightness, enlarge the font size for\\neasier viewing, and reduce the color temperature to reduce the blue light—the\\nshort-wavelength visible light associated with increased eye strain—emitted.\\nAlternatively, employees can also wear computer glasses, which have yellow-\\ntinted lenses that block blue light. For more tips on reducing your exposure\\nto blue light, consult your local eye doctor.

Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, with the symptom\\nbeing blurry distance vision. Studies show that myopia rates in children are\\nincreasing as kids spend less time outdoors and more time involved in near\\nwork like digital device use. What many parents don’t know is that rapidly\\nprogressing myopia is more than just a hassle — it can harm your child’s eye\\nhealth. Children with progressive myopia are far more likely to develop\\npotentially sight-threatening eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, and\\nmacular degeneration later in life. Given the growing prevalence of myopia in\\nchildren the media are taking notice. There have been a number of articles\\nrecently about this issue in the New York Times, Women Fitness and more\\nlocally here in Bay Area Moms and Macaroni Kid. These articles have great tips\\nfor parents. We recommended kids get outside at least 2-3 hours a day and take\\nfrequent breaks from screen use to help their vision. We also offer new myopia\\ntreatments, including customized contact lenses and prescription eye drops,\\nthat we can use to treat myopia. Our practice specializes in providing these\\ntreatments and offers myopia consultations to customize a treatment plan for\\neach child. What Causes Myopia to Progress? Genetics play a large role in\\nmyopia development. Two nearsighted parents are more likely to have a myopic\\nchild than a couple with only one myopic parent, or no myopic parents at all.\\nNo one knows exactly why myopia progresses, but spending most of the day\\nindoors, focusing on near objects like screens and books, may be risk factors.\\nMore research is needed to determine whether the fact that children are\\nspending less time looking at faraway objects like a moving baseball or a\\nbasketball net might be contributing to the increase in myopia cases around\\nthe world. How Can I Prevent Myopia From Worsening? One of the best pieces of\\nadvice for parents of nearsighted children is to increase their child’s\\noutdoor playtime in the sun. In research studies, the progression of myopia\\nwas slower in children who spent a considerable amount of time in the sunshine\\nthan in children who did not. The World Health Organization advises that\\nchildren under 5 spend 1 hour or less per day in front of a screen, and no\\nscreen time is recommended for infants under 1. The Children’s Eye Foundation\\nrecommends outdoor play daily, and no screen time for children under 2. They\\nalso recommend no more than 1-2 hours per day for 2- to 5-year-olds, with\\nfrequent breaks. How Can a Myopia Management Eye Doctor Help? Myopia\\nmanagement eye doctors do more than prescribe corrective lenses. Although no\\nactual cure for myopia exists, there are methods that can help control its\\nprogression. Like most treatments, myopia treatment in children is most\\neffective when started early before a child is highly myopic. Our office\\npartners with Treehouse Eyes, the country’s leading provider of myopia\\ntreatments for children.

When\\nit comes to their vision, early detection of issues like nearsightedness\\n(myopia) is crucial for timely intervention and effective management. Myopia\\ncan impact a child’s academic performance, social interactions, and overall\\nquality of life if left unaddressed. In this article, we’ll highlight key\\nsigns that parents should watch for to identify if their child may be\\nexperiencing nearsightedness. Frequent Squinting: One of the most common signs\\nof nearsightedness in children is squinting. If you notice your child\\nsquinting often, especially when trying to see distant objects like road signs\\nor the whiteboard at school, it could indicate that they are having difficulty\\nfocusing on distant objects. Sitting Close to the TV or Holding Devices Close:\\nChildren with nearsightedness may instinctively sit closer to the television\\nor hold digital devices closer to their face to see more clearly. While\\noccasional closeness to screens is common, persistent behavior of this nature\\ncould be a red flag for myopia. Complaints of Headaches or Eye Strain:\\nChildren experiencing nearsightedness may complain of frequent headaches or\\neye strain, particularly after engaging in activities that require focusing on\\ndistant objects for extended periods, such as reading or watching movies in a\\ntheater. Difficulty Seeing the Whiteboard or Screen at School: If your child\\nconsistently has difficulty seeing the whiteboard or screen in the classroom,\\ndespite sitting in the front rows, it could indicate nearsightedness. They may\\nalso struggle to recognize faces or objects from a distance. Rubbing Eyes\\nFrequently: Excessive rubbing of the eyes can be a sign of eye fatigue or\\nstrain, which often accompanies nearsightedness. If you observe your child\\nrubbing their eyes frequently, especially after engaging in activities that\\nrequire visual concentration, it’s worth investigating further. Decline in\\nAcademic Performance: Unexplained declines in academic performance,\\nparticularly in subjects that require visual acuity like reading or math, may\\nbe attributed to undiagnosed nearsightedness. If your child’s grades suddenly\\ndrop or they express frustration with schoolwork, consider scheduling an eye\\nexam. Family History of Myopia: Genetics play a significant role in the\\ndevelopment of myopia. If one or both parents have myopia, there’s an\\nincreased likelihood that their children will also develop the condition. Keep\\nthis in mind and remain vigilant for signs of nearsightedness in your child,\\nespecially if there’s a family history. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your\\nChild’s Myopia: Recognizing the signs of nearsightedness in your child early\\non is essential for proactive intervention and effective management. If you\\nobserve any of the aforementioned signs or have concerns about your child’s\\nvision, don’t hesitate to schedule an myopia consultation with a Treehouse\\nEyes provider. Remember, addressing vision issues promptly can significantly\\nimpact your child’s overall well-being and success in various aspects of life.\\nLet’s work together to ensure our children’s vision remains clear for a bright\\nfuture ahead.

It can help you sleep\\nbetter by regulating your circadian rhythm. Studies show that daily and\\nhealthy exposure to sunlight can benefit the eyes of little ones. A local\\nscleral optometrist explains why safe sun exposure is great for your\\nchildren’s eyes. Sunlight and Your Kids’ Eyes Myopia or nearsightedness\\nhappens when the shape of the eye is too curved, keeping light from properly\\nfocusing on the retina. People who have it struggle to see distant objects.\\nWhen not detected and treated early, it can affect a child’s performance in\\nschool and at play. Have you noticed that your child blinks or squints a lot?\\nDo they often complain of headaches or that they can’t see the words on the\\nboard at school? If so, it’s best to schedule a visit with your local\\noptometrist. These are typical signs of nearsightedness in children. At Lumen\\nOptometric, we are here for your family’s vision correction and dry eye\\ntreatment needs. Moreover, research shows that children who spend time\\noutdoors are less likely to develop this vision condition. Experts believe\\nbright sunlight can aid in the retina’s production of dopamine, a hormone that\\ncan help regulate eye growth. Tips for Healthy Sun Exposure While natural\\nlight might benefit your child’s eyes, you should discourage them from looking\\ndirectly at the sun. Like adults, they need to wear UV-blocking sunglasses to\\nkeep their eyes safe from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. Even when\\nit’s cloudy outside, you and your child should apply sunscreen and wear\\nsunglasses. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat can also reduce the UV rays that reach\\nyour little one’s eyes. Then, limit their time outdoors during the sun’s peak\\nhours, which is from midday to early afternoon. Routine eye exams can help you\\nkeep track of your family’s vision and eye health.

It affects the\\ncornea, or the clear layer that covers your eye’s iris and protects the pupil.\\nLumen Optometric discusses its causes, symptoms, and treatment. What Causes a\\nScratched Cornea? Anything that comes into contact with the clear surface of\\nyour eyes can lead to a corneal abrasion. Rubbing your eyes too hard can cause\\na scratched cornea, as well as a grain of dust or sand getting lodged on the\\nfront of your eye. Wearing contact lenses longer than is recommended and\\npoking your eye accidentally can also lead to this type of eye injury. The\\nrisk of a scratched cornea increases when you experience dry eye syndrome.\\nBeing diagnosed with this condition makes it hard for you to sleep, since the\\neyelids may stick to the cornea. Upon waking up, your eyelids may tear a part\\nof your cornea, resulting in a scratch or abrasion. What Are the Symptoms of a\\nScratched Cornea? Any eye injury, including a corneal abrasion, must be\\nexamined by your eye doctor. Visit them right away if you start experiencing\\nany of these symptoms: Blurry vision.Eye pain that doesn’t resolve in minutes\\nor hours.Feeling that something’s stuck in your eye.Foreign matter lodged in\\nfront of your eyes like dirt or small particles.Light sensitivity How Is\\nCorneal Abrasion Treated? Before you visit your eye doctor, consider reducing\\nthe symptoms and the risk of infection. You can rinse the affected eye with\\nsaline solution to dislodge specks of dust or dirt. Try blinking several times\\nas well to move the small particles from the cornea to the eyelashes. Your eye\\ndoctor will examine the affected eye and remove any objects they may find. To\\nminimize discomfort during this prescription, they’ll apply anesthetic eye\\ndrops. They may prescribe you with eye drops to keep the eye lubricated and\\nminimize infection and inflammation, as well as oral medication if you feel\\npain or light sensitivity. The healing time varies depending on how small or\\nlarge the corneal abrasion is. Turn to Lumen Optometric for your immediate and\\nongoing optic needs.

Place\\nnightlights in hallways, bedrooms and hallways to reduce the likelihood of\\nfalling or tripping.

October 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Cutting\\ncorners is never an option when it comes to proper eye care. As such, you’ll\\nwant to know which type of contact lenses best suit your needs and\\npreferences, so it does its job while not getting in the way of your daily\\nroutine. However, with so many specific choices available, it can be a bit\\noverwhelming to work out which type of lenses are best for your use. To help\\nyou determine your most preferred type of contact lenses, corneal reshaping\\nexpert Lumen Optometric has put together a quick comparison between daily and\\nmonthly contact lenses, and which is most ideal for your daily use. Daily\\nContact Lenses Also known as daily disposables, they come ready to insert in\\nindividual blister packs for one-day use. When the day’s done and you’re about\\nto sleep in for the night, just dispose of your lenses in the trash. When you\\nwake up, you open another blister pack for a new pair. You don’t need to worry\\nabout cleaning or storing the lenses each time you use daily contact lenses\\nsince they’re disposable. They’re also generally very thin and have a high\\nwater content, and if you remove these contacts during the day for any reason,\\nyou’ll need to replace them with a fresh new pair. Monthly Contact Lenses\\nThese lenses are thicker and more durable than daily lenses because they have\\nto resist drying out while you store and use them for 30 days. When you aren’t\\nwearing them, you can store the contact lenses in a small two-sided container\\nwith some contact solution. When using monthly contact lenses, you need to\\nclean them to avoid infections and protein buildup. There are various contact\\nsolutions you can use to clean monthly lenses, and you should only use the\\nones recommended by your eye doctor. This is because different brands and\\ntypes of solutions that use different chemicals can be incompatible and even\\ndestroy a contact they’re not designed for. Which is More Ideal for Your Use?\\nThe type of contact lenses you’ll use can actually depend on what your trusted\\neye doctor prescribes you. Your prescription might determine whether you\\nchoose monthly or daily contact lenses, but not all types of contacts are\\navailable for every prescription. For instance, if you need multifocal lenses,\\nsome are only available as monthlies. But if your prescription allows you to\\nuse both daily and monthly lenses, then you can consider which is better for\\nyour lifestyle. If your lifestyle makes it likely that something may get in\\nyour eye, then having daily disposables means you can just take out the lens\\nand throw it out so you won’t have to bother with trying to clean the contact\\nof any contaminants. This is especially handy if you work outdoors or don’t\\nhave easy access to facilities to clean and store your contact lenses. But if\\nyou have a controlled lifestyle and always have access to a washroom and\\nmirror to remove and clean your lenses if needed, then monthlies could work\\nbetter for your daily use. When you need to have your eyes checked by a\\ntrusted eye exam doctor, don’t hesitate to visit Lumen Optometric.

AMD typically occurs as\\naging causes damage to the macula, a part of the retina that controls sharp\\nvision. While it does not cause total blindness, AMD makes it harder for\\npeople to perform their daily routines, such as reading, driving, or doing any\\nclose-up work. In this article, Lumen Optometric, known for high-quality\\neyeglasses and contact lenses, explains everything you need to know about AMD.\\nWhat Are the Different Types and Symptoms of AMD? There are two types of AMD:\\ndry and wet. Dry AMD, also called atrophic AMD, occurs when the macula gets\\nthinner and progresses slowly over many years. It also has three stages:\\nearly, intermediate, and late. During the early and intermediate dry AMD\\nstage, some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience mild\\nblurriness in their central vision. On the other hand, wet AMD, also called\\nadvanced neovascular AMD, is a less common type of late AMD. It happens when\\nabnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, which eventually causes\\ndamage to the macula. As such, wet AMD causes faster vision loss. It’s\\nimportant to note that any stage of dry AMD can turn into wet AMD, but wet AMD\\nis always late. People with late AMD may notice straight lines looking wavy or\\ncrooked. They may also see a blurry area near the center of their vision,\\nwhich may get bigger as time goes by. Some people report seeing blank spots or\\nhaving trouble seeing in low lighting. If you experience any of these\\nsymptoms, be sure to see an optometrist immediately. How Do Doctors Diagnose\\nAMD? One effective way to check if you have AMD is through an eye exam. Your\\neye exam doctor may also perform any of the following procedures to diagnose\\nAMD successfully: Distance and near vision acuity testsDilated eye examination\\n(which also includes using an ophthalmoscope) — The pupil of your eye is\\ndilated to allow your doctor to observe your macula at the inside back wall of\\nthe eye.Optical coherence tomography testing (OCT) — To gain a clearer picture\\nof your macula and its supporting layers, OCT generates high-quality images of\\nthe eye.

It affects all of the\\nsystems of the body, including the eyes. The decrease in estrogen levels can\\nalter one’s eyesight. Even the shape of the eyes undergoes a slight change,\\nmaking it hard for women to wear contact lenses comfortably. Eye Conditions\\nAssociated With Menopause The following are some of the most common eye\\nconditions that affect women during menopause: Dry Eyes – Women over the age\\nof 50 have been shown to be at high risk of developing symptoms of dry eye\\nsyndrome such as blurred vision, light sensitivity and swollen or reddened\\neyelids. The decrease in hormone levels can also lower the salinity of the\\ninner tear film and the oils of the outer tear film. Cataracts – Decreased\\nhormone levels can also increase the risk for cataracts. Common signs and\\nsymptoms include seeing fading colors and halos around light sources and\\nhaving difficulty seeing at night. Scheduling regular visits to your eye exam\\ndoctor can help detect this condition early. Glaucoma – This eye condition is\\nalso common in menopausal women. It leads to the damage of the optic nerve,\\nusually from increased eye pressure. Early detection and treatment can help\\nprotect the eyes from vision loss associated with glaucoma. Eye Care During\\nMenopause Taking a proactive approach is the best way to preserve your vision\\nduring your menopause years. In addition to annual eye exams, your eye doctor\\nmay recommend hormone therapy to restore your estrogen levels. While it may\\nhelp reduce the risk of developing these eye conditions, patients who undergo\\nsuch are four to seven times more likely to develop dry eye symptoms. Other\\nways to control menopause symptoms include a more natural approach like taking\\nherbal supplements and consuming a diet rich in Vitamin D. Lifestyle changes\\ncan also help reduce dry eye symptoms like removing drafts and wearing\\nwraparound sunglasses outdoors.

We will be discussing the four best ways to treat your myopia so it no\\nlonger gets worse. Everything we discuss is based on solid science and\\nresearch, double-masked clinical trials, and recommendations based on\\nmountains of peer-reviewed data. Certainly, we’ve heard and researched other\\nmore holistic approaches, if they turn out to be effective, know that this is\\nsurely a growing field however and as things change you’ll certainly hear it\\nfrom us first! What is Myopia? Before you can defeat your enemy, you need to\\nknow exactly what it is. Myopia is a disease of the eye that is usually the\\nresult of an eyeball that has grown too long. We call how long the eyeball is\\nthe ‘axial length’. When the axial length grows excessively long, your vision\\nwill suffer in direct correlation. So any treatment we discuss has to show\\nefficacy in its ability to reduce axial length elongation compared to a\\ncontrol group. Other times, the cornea may be too steep which can also cause\\nmyopia. However, for the sake of this article, we will address the major cause\\nof myopia which is the excessive axial length of the eye. As when we talk\\nabout managing myopia, we will be talking about ways that have shown clinical\\nevidence in slowing down axial length growth. Custom Orthokeratology or\\nOvernight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed\\ncontact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while\\nsleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names\\nfor orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping\\nsystem, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the\\ncurvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While\\ninitially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see\\nmore clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in\\nreducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused\\nin front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the\\noptical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact\\nlenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning, and\\ndisinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper\\nhygiene this is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating\\nchildren of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that\\ncan be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to\\ntreat children with amblyopia, or sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be\\nused to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well.\\nWhat we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of\\natropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of\\naction is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of\\nthe eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at\\nwhich the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic\\nprogression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are\\nbeing designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight\\ncontact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia\\nby almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers\\nthroughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral\\nretina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact\\nlens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia\\nas well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating\\nEyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a\\nsimilar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is\\na particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact\\nlenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s\\nbodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of\\npower in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial\\nlength elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good\\nnews is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids—just like\\nyours—so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above\\nare four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been\\ndiagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with\\na contact lens while sleeping. Atropine involves an eye drop that can signal\\nthe eye to grow a little slower. Custom soft multifocal lenses are worn during\\nthe day. And even specially designed glasses are on the horizon to improve the\\nprogression of myopia.

But with so many of these conditions identified by\\nthe medical community, it can be hard to list down all of their possible\\neffects on the eyes. Understanding the risk your specific autoimmune disorder\\nposes to your vision is key to ensuring optimal eye health. Consult your eye\\ndoctor immediately if you start experiencing eyesight problems. In this blog,\\nLumen Optometric, your trusted eye care center for neurolens® treatment,\\nshares some of the autoimmune disorders that affect the eyes. Lupus It is a\\ntype of autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly\\nattacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body, including the eyes. It can\\nlead to eye-related conditions like retinal vascular lesions and optic\\nneuropathy. Symptoms may include blurred vision, sore or dry eyes, and light\\nsensitivity. Rheumatoid Arthritis It is a chronic multisystem disease with\\nmusculoskeletal manifestations. While it primarily targets the hands, arms,\\nlegs and feet, this inflammatory disorder can also affect the eyes. Dry eye\\nsyndrome, however, is the most common eye condition to accompany rheumatoid\\narthritis. A visit to an eye doctor can help determine necessary dry eye\\ntreatment to alleviate discomfort. Other eye-related conditions associated\\nwith rheumatoid arthritis include scleritis (inflammation of the white part of\\nthe eye) and uveitis (inflammation of the tissues in the eyewall). Multiple\\nSclerosis This autoimmune disorder affects the central nervous system. Given\\nthat the optic nerve is directly connected to it, an individual may be\\ndiagnosed with MS after the development of initial symptoms of vision\\nproblems. Optic neuritis, for instance, can bring a combination of color\\nvision loss, blurred vision and double vision that usually affects only one\\neye. Turn to Lumen Optometric for your immediate and ongoing optic needs. Our\\ntalented eye exam doctor is expertly trained to identify vision problems and\\ncustomize effective solutions to improve your eye health.

Continue reading as a trusted eye exam doctor further\\ndiscusses the importance of having your eyes checked post-concussion. Visual\\nDisturbances and Concussions Concussions can lead to a range of visual\\ndisturbances, such as blurred vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia) and\\ndifficulty focusing. These symptoms may not be immediately apparent but can\\nmanifest in the days or weeks following the injury. A post-concussion eye exam\\nhelps identify and address these issues, promoting a more effective recovery.\\nDetecting Ocular Motor Dysfunction Concussions often affect the coordination\\nof eye movements, known as ocular motor function. This can result in\\ndifficulties with tracking objects, maintaining focus or experiencing eye\\nstrain. A specialized eye examination can pinpoint ocular motor dysfunction,\\nguiding the implementation of targeted therapies to improve eye coordination\\nand alleviate associated symptoms. Assessing Binocular Vision Problems\\nBinocular vision problems, where the eyes struggle to work together\\nseamlessly, are common after concussions. This can lead to double vision,\\ndepth perception challenges and discomfort. Through a comprehensive check, an\\neye doctor can assess binocular vision problems and recommend appropriate\\ninterventions, such as vision therapy or corrective lenses. Addressing Light\\nSensitivity Photophobia is a frequent symptom post-concussion. Exposure to\\nlight can exacerbate headaches and discomfort, whether you’re wearing\\neyeglasses or contact lenses. Optometrists can evaluate the extent of light\\nsensitivity during an eye exam and recommend strategies to manage it\\neffectively. This may include specialized lenses or advice on controlling\\nlighting environments. Preventing Prolonged Visual Symptoms Early detection\\nand intervention are key to preventing prolonged visual symptoms after a\\nconcussion. Without proper assessment and treatment, visual issues may persist\\nand impact daily life. Timely eye exams can identify underlying problems and\\nenable the implementation of targeted therapies, promoting a smoother recovery\\nprocess.

Why Eyesight Is Crucial\\nfor Education Eye health can deeply affect your child’s academic progress. In\\nfact, roughly 80% of learning during a child’s first 12 years involves the use\\nof the eyes. Vision problems may inevitably lead to challenges in reading,\\nwriting and even social activities. The Eye as a Health Indicator Beyond\\nvision, an eye exam can be a window to your child’s overall health. Vision\\nproblems can hint at other health issues, such as diabetes or high blood\\npressure. In some cases, an eye exam can be the first step in diagnosing such\\nconditions. The Benefits of Early Detection As with most health problems,\\ncatching eye issues early makes a big difference. For instance, certain\\ncorrective measures work best when started early. Identifying eye concerns\\nearly helps avoid potential complications and ensures your child’s vision is\\nnot adversely impacted. Why a Yearly Exam Is Necessary Regular eye exams are\\nvital in monitoring vision changes and intervening promptly when necessary.\\nWhile basic screenings in school can help flag significant problems, they\\ndon’t compare to a comprehensive exam by a professional optometrist. They go\\nbeyond reading charts to examine the eye’s health and ensure anomalies are\\ntreated before they become more serious.

(While staring at a\\ncomputer screen, you tend to blink less often. This increases the risk of dry\\neye because blinking is how a tear film—which helps keep your eyes moist—is\\nspread across the surface of your eye.) However, recent studies have shown\\nthat having diabetes mellitus increases your risk for dry eyes. Lumen\\nOptometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, explains how diabetes and dry eyes\\nare connected and elaborate on the possible treatment options below: How\\nDiabetes and Dry Eyes Are Connected Some medical researchers believe diabetic\\nneuropathy can explain the connection between diabetes and dry eyes.\\nNeuropathy happens when some of the nerves are damaged. It’s also a risk\\nfactor for lacrimal gland dysfunction. If the lacrimal gland (which secretes\\nthe watery component of the tear film) is damaged, tear production decreases.\\nThis, in turn, increases a patient’s risk for dry eyes. Important: Diabetes is\\njust one of several factors that can increase your risk for dry eyes. Other\\nfactors include age (it’s not uncommon for people aged over 65 to experience\\ndry eyes) and environmental conditions (tears evaporate more quickly in dry\\nclimates). If you have any of the aforementioned risk factors, you should\\nundergo an eye exam at least once a year. Through routine eye exams, your eye\\ndoctor can detect and treat eye conditions before they progress or give higher\\nprescriptions for contact lenses before blurry vision interferes with your\\ndaily routines. How Are Dry Eyes Treated Your eye doctor may recommend the\\nfollowing treatment options: Artificial tears – To alleviate the symptoms of\\nmild or moderate dry eyes, you may need to apply artificial tears several\\ntimes during the day. Eye inserts – An eye insert resembles a grain of rice\\nand releases lubrication as it dissolves. It is placed between your lower\\neyelid and your eyeball. To learn more about your treatment options, consult\\nyour local eye doctor. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional\\neye care services, including corneal reshaping services.

Since their early invention,\\ncontact lenses have progressed a long way, transitioning from glass to hard\\nplastic and finally to the soft materials we use today. In this blog post,\\nwe’ll delve into how exactly contact lenses are made and how manufacturers\\nhave revolutionized the way they are produced by harnessing modern technology\\nand materials. The Foundation: Materials and Molding The journey begins with\\nselecting the base material. Soft contact lenses are typically made from\\nhydrogel or silicone hydrogel, which are chosen for their oxygen permeability\\nand biocompatibility. These materials allow your eyes to breathe, which is\\nessential for healthy wear. Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lenses, on the other\\nhand, prioritize oxygen permeability even further. They are primarily made\\nfrom highly durable and breathable plastics like fluoropolymers combined with\\nsilicone. Once the material is chosen, the lenses undergo a molding process to\\nachieve their final shape. Here’s where the methods differ. Soft Contact\\nLenses Soft contact lenses are made through spin-casting or lathe-cutting\\nprocess. Spin-casting involves depositing liquid plastic into molds and then\\nspinning them until the plastic takes the desired shape. Lathe-cutting,\\nmeanwhile, involves carving the plastic into lens form. Computer-controlled\\ntools meticulously sculpt the lens from a disc of material. Both methods lead\\nto polishing for comfort and hydration before reaching your eyes. Rigid Gas-\\nPermeable Lenses RGP lenses prioritize oxygen permeability, which is crucial\\nfor healthy corneal function. Their shaping process utilizes lathe-cutting,\\nwhich offers greater precision for intricate designs. It meticulously sculpts\\nthe lens design from the disc, similar to a woodworking lathe but with\\nincredible accuracy. This allows for intricate shapes and sharper edges. RGP\\nlenses can have complex curves and features to address specific vision needs,\\nlike astigmatism. Lathe-cutting enables these intricate geometries.\\nAdditionally, precise cutting ensures clean and sharp edges on the lens, which\\nis necessary for optimal tear flow and lens stability in the eye. Shaping and\\nFinishing Touches Following the molding stage, both soft and RGP lenses\\nundergo additional processes to ensure comfort and clarity. Polishing: Lenses\\nare polished to achieve a smooth and comfortable surface for wearers. This\\nstep is essential for both soft and RGP lenses to minimize irritation.\\nHydration (Soft Lenses Only): Soft contact lenses are bathed in a sterile\\nsolution to absorb water and achieve their characteristic flexibility. This\\nstep is not required for RGP lenses. Quality Control and Packaging Every lens,\\nsoft or RGP, undergoes rigorous inspection for any defects or imperfections.\\nThis enables your scleral optometrist to provide you with only the highest-\\nquality lenses. Finally, the lenses are packaged in sterile blisters filled\\nwith saline solution. This solution keeps soft lenses hydrated and all lenses\\nready for use. Advanced Types of Contact Lenses Today, advancements in eye\\ncare have led to the development of customized contact lenses for specific eye\\nconditions. For example, specially crafted lenses can now be made for\\nirregularly shaped corneas. Additionally, advancements in materials have led\\nto extended wear options for both soft and RGP lenses, allowing comfortable\\nwear for extended periods. If you are undergoing dry eye treatment, be sure to\\nwork closely with your eye doctor to find the best solution for your vision\\nneeds. Get Your Lenses From Lumen Optometric Today The manufacturing process\\nof contact lenses is a complex and precise dance of science and technology,\\ncatering to the specific needs of soft and RGP lenses.

These lenses offer a smooth transition\\nbetween distances, eliminating the need for multiple glasses. They can also\\nhelp treat other eye conditions. However, progressive lenses have pros and\\ncons like any vision correction option. In this article, we explore the\\nadvantages and disadvantages of progressive lenses to help you decide whether\\nthey are the right choice for you. Pros of Progressive Lenses Here are some of\\nthe benefits of progressive lenses. Improved Vision Progressive lenses provide\\na more seamless transition between different prescriptions, allowing for\\nclearer vision at all distances. Wearers can see objects at varying lengths\\nwithout switching glasses or straining their eyes. Greater Comfort Progressive\\nlenses eliminate the visible lines that come with traditional bifocals or\\ntrifocals. This makes them a more comfortable option for extended wear,\\nparticularly for activities like driving or using a computer. More Natural\\nVision Progressive lenses provide a more natural visual experience than\\ntraditional bifocals or reading glasses. This is because they offer a gradual\\nchange in prescription, mimicking how the eyes naturally adjust to different\\ndistances. Improved Aesthetics With no visible line, progressive lenses\\nprovide a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. This appeals to those who\\nwant to avoid the stigma of traditional bifocals or reading glasses. Cons of\\nProgressive Lenses Despite their many advantages, there are drawbacks to\\nprogressive lenses. These include the following: Cost Progressive lenses can\\nbe more expensive than traditional bifocals or reading glasses because they\\nrequire more advanced technology. This can be a barrier for those on a budget\\nor without insurance coverage for vision correction. Adaptation Period\\nAdjusting to progressive lenses can take some time. This can cause some\\ninitial discomfort or disorientation. Reduced Peripheral Vision Since\\nprogressive lenses have a narrow corridor of clear vision, wearers may\\nexperience reduced peripheral vision. This can be a safety concern, especially\\nwhen driving or navigating unfamiliar environments. Increased Risk of Glare\\nProgressive lenses can create more reflections and glare, particularly in\\nbright light conditions. This can be an issue for those outdoors or in\\nenvironments with bright lighting. How to Adapt to Progressive Lenses When\\nadapting to progressive lenses, allow a few days for your eyes to get used to\\nyour new lens prescription. Practice focusing on familiar objects that are\\nlocated at different distances from you so you can easily switch between far\\nand near vision when needed. Patience also goes a long way in getting used to\\nprogressive lenses. To be sure that progressive lenses are right for you,\\nschedule a consultation at Lumen Optometric. Our experts can assist you with\\neverything from Neurolens treatment to dry eye treatment in Sierra Madre, CA.\\nIf you are also looking for a scleral optometrist, you can get in touch with\\nus.

As a parent, you also want to make\\nsure that your child can see well enough to do the things they enjoy doing.\\nPediatric optometrists are specialized healthcare professionals who care for\\nthe visual and ocular needs of infants, children, and teens. In this article,\\nwe will discuss some factors you must consider when choosing an optometrist\\nfor your children. Location Location is essential when choosing the best\\noptometrist for kids near you. If your child has a busy schedule, it may be\\nmore difficult for them to travel long distances to get to their appointments.\\nMaybe you’re unsure about how far away from home an office is. Ask the doctor\\nor staff if they have any recommendations on other practices they could\\nrecommend that might better suit your needs. Call ahead if multiple offices\\nare within driving distance of your home. Make sure each office offers the\\nsame services before making an appointment with them. Experience The\\nexperience of an optometrist for children is one of the most important factors\\nto consider when choosing the best eye doctor for kids. An excellent way to\\ngauge this is by asking how long they’ve been practicing optometry and whether\\nthey have additional training relevant to your child’s specific needs (such as\\nmyopia management). Treehouse Eyes provides expert pediatric myopia care and\\nensures this with accessibility to Treehouse AMP, a video-based parent\\neducation platform. Treehouse Eyes doctors are always willing to answer any\\nquestions regarding myopia and while also cultivating a kid-friendly office\\nexperience. Recommendations The best way to find a pediatric optometrist you\\ncan rely on and who will get along well with your child is through referrals\\nand recommendations. If you know someone who had a positive experience with an\\neye doctor, find out who they used and why they thought so highly of them.\\nConsider that some of your friends have young children of their own. Before\\nchoosing which practice is best for you and your family, it might be useful to\\nknow what kind of experiences other people have had there. If no one in your\\nfamily or circle of friends can personally recommend an optometrist, look\\nonline for reviews of nearby practices. You can also use the Google Maps\\nbusiness filter by typing “optometrist for children near me” into the search\\nbar. You can add whatever city or town you live in and see the reviews. This\\nshould bring up several options nearby where children receive treatment from\\nprofessionals specializing in vision care issues explicitly related to young\\npeople (such as myopia).

The right glasses are comfortable and give\\nyou sharp vision throughout the day. Despite the dependability of this\\neyewear, it can still cause spots or pimples to form on your face.\\nFortunately, there are several ways to avoid this issue. Here’s what you can\\ndo to prevent breakouts from wearing eyeglasses. Clean Your Glasses Frequently\\nThe pressure that eyeglasses put on your skin is what usually causes acne. It\\nprevents dead skin cells from shedding, causing them to clog your pores and\\nform pimples. If you have oily skin or wear thick layers of makeup, you are\\nmore likely to get breakouts from eyeglass wear. Regularly cleaning your\\neyeglasses will help prevent breakouts. You can use an alcohol wipe to clean\\nthem, focusing on areas that touch your skin. Have Your Glasses Adjusted Does\\nit feel like your glasses are so heavy or pushing too hard on your nose?\\nExcessive pressure from your glasses can contribute to breakouts. If this is\\nthe case, see your eye doctor and have your eyeglass frame adjusted. In some\\ncases, replacing the nose bridges allow more even pressure distribution. Give\\nYour Face a Break from Eyeglasses When you wear eyeglasses every day, it’s\\neasy to forget that you even have them on. While they give you sharper vision,\\nit helps to take breaks from wearing them from time to time. It relieves the\\npressure on your face that often contributes to breakouts. Remove Your Makeup\\nat the End of the Day Thoroughly remove your makeup at the end of the day.\\nCosmetic products can accumulate under your glasses, increasing the likelihood\\nof acne. Using makeup remover before cleansing ensures that you’re really\\ngetting rid of the products on your face. Don’t wait for your vision to change\\nbefore seeing your eye doctor. At Lumen Optometric, we offer a wide range of\\neye care services, including myopia treatment and orthokeratology.

Without proper treatment,\\nvision problems can affect a child’s learning, increase the risk of permanent\\nvision loss and even lead to behavioral issues. The American Optometric\\nAssociation strongly recommends your little one see an eye exam doctor yearly.\\nThis Healthy Vision Month, we are sharing tips on taking a proactive approach\\nto your child’s eye health. Avoid Excess Screen Time At least two screen time\\nincreases the risk of obesity, mood swings, aggressive behavior and obesity in\\nchildren. The blue light from digital devices can contribute to digital eye\\nstrain. This eye condition is usually characterized by blurred vision, dry\\neye, headaches, and neck and shoulder pain. According to the Department of\\nHealth, children below two should have no screen time because it can affect\\nphysical and language development. Schedule Regular Eye Exams It’s a common\\nmisconception that you only need to see an eye care specialist if you need to\\nupdate your contact lenses or eyeglasses. Regular eye exams can detect and\\ntreat eye conditions early in adults and children. If you see your child\\nconstantly squinting, tilting their head, or rubbing their eyes, schedule an\\nappointment with your eye doctor immediately. These are common signs of vision\\nproblems in young individuals. Prepare Well-Balanced Meals Incorporating leafy\\ngreens and foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids in your daily meals is beneficial\\nto the entire family’s eye health. Vitamin A in leafy greens can lower the\\nrisk of dry eye syndrome, while omega-3 fatty acids can lower the risk of\\ncataracts and age-related macular degeneration. It’s also a good idea to\\nconsume fruits rich in vitamins C and E, such as pineapples, oranges,\\nstrawberries and mangoes. These vitamins can help restore tissues in your eyes\\nand prevent infections. Moreover, an overall balanced diet is essential in\\npreventing obesity and hypertension, which contribute to several eye diseases.\\nAt Lumen Optometric, we are committed to restoring your vision and helping you\\nmaintain good eye health. We offer a wide range of services, including corneal\\nreshaping therapy, myopia treatment and neurolens therapy. Call us at (626)\\n921-0199 or fill out our contact form to request an appointment.

Protecting your eyes from the sun’s damage is crucial to\\nmaintaining good eye health and preventing problems down the road. This blog\\npost discusses the risks of UV exposure and provides you with practical tips\\nfor keeping your eyes safe from the sun’s harmful effects. Understand the\\nRisks of UV Exposure UV exposure can have both short-term and long-term\\neffects on your eyes. In the short term, you may experience photokeratitis,\\nalso known as “sunburn of the eye,” or pterygium, a growth on the white of the\\neye. Long-term damage includes cataracts and macular degeneration. Some\\nindividuals are at higher risk for UV-related eye problems, such as outdoor\\nworkers and those with light-colored eyes. Choose the Right Sunglasses The\\nright pair of sunglasses can play a significant role in protecting your eyes\\nfrom UV damage. Look for sunglasses labeled with 100% UVA and UVB protection.\\nLens color and tint can also make a difference. Gray, green and brown lenses\\ncan help maintain color recognition. Consider polarized lenses to reduce\\nglare, especially if you spend a lot of time near water or snow. Wraparound\\nframes offer added protection by shielding your eyes from sunlight entering\\nfrom the sides. Wear a Wide-Brimmed Hat A wide-brimmed hat can provide\\nadditional protection from indirect sunlight. By reducing your exposure to\\nharmful UV rays, you can lower the risk of eye damage. Schedule Regular Eye\\nExams Early detection and prevention are essential to maintaining good eye\\nhealth. Regular visits to an eye exam doctor can help you monitor changes in\\nyour vision and eye health. Comprehensive exams can catch problems early,\\ngiving you the best chance for successful treatment. Consider Protective\\nContact Lenses For contact lens wearers, UV-blocking contact lenses can offer\\nan added layer of protection against the sun’s harmful rays. Consult an\\noptometrist to determine which type of contact lenses are best suited for you.\\nExplore Orthokeratology Orthokeratology or ortho-k, is a treatment that\\ninvolves wearing specially designed contact lenses overnight to reshape the\\ncornea. This non-surgical procedure can help reduce the risk of UV damage to\\nthe eye and improve vision. Take Precautions During Peak Sun Hours Avoiding\\ndirect sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. can help protect your eyes from\\nharmful UV rays. If you must be outdoors during these hours, seek shade\\nwhenever possible. Educate Children on Eye Protection Teaching children about\\nthe importance of eye protection from a young age is crucial for maintaining\\ntheir long-term eye health. Encourage kids to wear sunglasses and hats when\\noutdoors to shield their eyes from the sun. Protecting your eyes from UV\\ndamage is essential for maintaining good eye health. By understanding the\\nrisks and taking the necessary precautions, you can reduce your chances of\\ndeveloping UV-related eye problems.

Around 30%\\nof teenagers, 9% of kids in school, and 5% of preschoolers have it. If both of\\na child’s parents are nearsighted, the child is more likely to have myopia.\\nMyopia is generally on the rise, particularly in children. Experts believe\\nthat it might have something to do with spending more time indoors playing\\nvideo games and using electronic gadgets. Read on to learn about some of the\\nbest myopia treatment options for children. The Development of Myopia When a\\nchild’s eyeball grows too rapidly relative to the usual pace of eye growth,\\nmyopia occurs. It may also develop if the cornea, the transparent window in\\nfront of the eye, curves too sharply. Light rays are unable to reach the\\nretina when they enter the eye, which makes nearby objects look clear and\\ndistant objects look blurry. Treating Myopia in Childhood Although it cannot\\nbe cured or reversed, myopia can be managed and treated. The treatment’s\\nobjectives are to strengthen your child’s vision and stop it from\\ndeteriorating. Managing myopia is crucial for maintaining their eye health.\\nTreatment Options to Combat Myopia Progression: Specialized Contact Lenses:\\nCustomized multifocal contact lenses are tailored to address myopia\\nprogression by slowing down eye growth in some children. Additionally,\\northokeratology, also known as Ortho-K, offers a unique solution by reshaping\\nthe cornea overnight, thus ensuring clearer vision throughout the day. Low-\\nDose Atropine Eye Drops: Children may benefit from the use of low-dose\\natropine eye drops, similar to those administered during routine eye\\nexaminations. This treatment approach has shown promise in managing myopia\\nprogression effectively. Increasing Outdoor Time: Encouraging children to\\nspend more time outdoors can help counteract the onset and progression of\\nmyopia. Balancing screen time with outdoor activities is vital for\\nsafeguarding their eye health as they continue to grow. Consultation with a\\nTreehouse Eyes Provider: For parents unsure about the most suitable treatment\\noption for their child, consulting with a qualified optometrist is essential.\\nOptometrists with myopia management expertise can provide personalized\\nrecommendations and guidance tailored to each child’s specific needs and\\ncircumstances. In conclusion, addressing myopia in children requires a\\ncomprehensive approach focused on effective treatment strategies and proactive\\nmanagement techniques. By leveraging innovative solutions and collaborating\\nwith eye care professionals, parents can ensure optimal vision health for\\ntheir children both now and in the future. If you’re not sure which treatment\\nwould be the best choice, consult your optometrist to determine how you can\\nmanage your child’s myopia.

This eye condition can cause cloudy or blurred\\nvision and increased light sensitivity. Patients may also experience poor\\nnight vision or notice that colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. While\\ncataracts usually occur in older adults, this eye condition can happen to\\nanyone. A local scleral optometrist shares the different types of cataracts.\\nTypes of Cataracts Age-Related Cataracts Cataracts can occur due to the\\nchanges in your eyes as you age. You’re more prone to age-related cataracts if\\nyou drink alcohol excessively, smoke cigarettes, take steroids and have\\ndiabetes. A family history of this eye condition and past eye surgeries also\\nincreases your risk for this eye condition. Congenital Cataracts Some people\\nare born with cataracts or develop them in the first year of life. It’s not\\ncommon for children to have cataracts. If your child’s cataracts are large\\nenough to impact vision, immediate treatment is necessary to avoid further eye\\nproblems, like amblyopia or lazy eye. Traumatic Cataracts Blunt and\\npenetrating eye injuries usually cause traumatic cataracts. This form of\\ncataract may develop immediately or years after the eye injury. Secondary\\nCataracts There is a chance for scar tissue to develop in the eye after\\ncataract surgery. If this happens, your vision will become cloudy again.\\nSecondary cataracts are more common than you think and occur in two out of\\nfive people who get cataract surgery. A quick and non-invasive procedure\\ncalled YAG laser capsulotomy is the typical treatment for this type of\\ncataract. Patients usually gain normal vision a few days following treatment.\\nHow Are Cataracts Diagnosed? Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial for\\nthe early detection of vision-threatening conditions like macular degeneration\\nand cataracts. Individuals older than 60 should schedule a dilated eye exam\\nevery one to two years. During your appointment, your eye care provider will\\nuse dilating eye drops to widen your pupil and check for signs of cataracts\\nand other eye issues. Your doctor might also perform a refraction test,\\nophthalmoscopy and slit lamp test. These tests will help them determine if you\\nneed new prescription glasses or dry eye treatment. How Are Cataracts Treated?\\nIf you have cataracts, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. In the\\ninitial stages of this eye condition, prescription glasses or contact lenses\\ncan help improve vision. You can also use brighter lights in your home and\\nwear anti-glare sunglasses outdoors. Moreover, your eye doctor will recommend\\nsurgery if cataracts are starting to disrupt your daily tasks. You don’t need\\nto wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor. Leave your\\neye care needs to Lumen Optometric. Besides comprehensive eye exams, we also\\noffer neurolens treatment, scleral lenses and orthokeratology. Call us at\\n(626) 921-0199 or complete our online form to schedule an appointment.

In\\nthis article, eye care specialists take a look at profiles of patients who may\\nneed extra UV eye protection. Construction Workers: Construction workers and\\nother people who work outdoors are exposed to 10-20% more UV light than the\\naverage indoor worker. Even if a worker wears a hat outside, the brim can only\\nblock their eyes from overhead UV light and not the indirect UV radiation that\\nis reflected on low-level surfaces. Outdoor Enthusiasts: Outdoor enthusiasts\\nsuch as cyclists and hikers spend a lot of time in the sun, thus requiring\\nsome protection from UV. Boaters and beachgoers should also equip themselves\\nwith eye protection because dry sand can reflect more than 15% of UV light\\nwhile sea foam can reflect up to 30%. Children: Some kids tend to spend more\\ntime outdoors than adults. Long-term effects of sun damage are cumulative. The\\nlonger children are not protected from the harmful rays of the sun, the more\\nlikely they will suffer damage to their eyes in their older years. Contact\\nLens Wearers: Some patients who wear contact lenses do not bother to wear\\nsunglasses because their contacts block UVA/UVB. While there are lenses that\\nprotect from UV radiation, they do not cover everything. The skin of the lids\\nand brow bone are left vulnerable and should be covered with a pair of\\nsunglasses. Health-Conscious Individuals: If you are conscious about your\\nhealth, you want to minimize your day-to-day interaction with environmental\\nhazards. Aside from eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly,\\nsafeguarding your eyes from UV radiation should be on your priority list,\\nespecially if you have a family history of age-related macular degeneration.\\nLumen Optometric is a premier eye care center specializing in comprehensive\\neye exams, myopia management, scleral lenses, neurolenses and more.

As such, the process of making prescription lenses\\ninvolves several steps. Continue reading to learn about prescription lenses,\\nhow they are made and the different types available. What Are Prescription\\nLenses? Prescription lenses are tailored spectacles that correct or improve\\nthe wearer’s vision. A dedicated optometrist assesses the unique needs of your\\neyes and prescribes lenses that adjust how light gets into your eyes, helping\\nyou see better. The Process of Making Prescription Lenses Making prescription\\nlenses involves several steps, from the initial eye examination to the final\\nfitting of the lenses into the frames. Here is a general overview of the\\nprocess. Eye Exam The process begins with an eye examination by an eye doctor.\\nDuring the exam, they will determine your specific vision prescription, which\\nincludes measurements for each eye, such as sphere power (for nearsightedness\\nor farsightedness), cylinder power (for astigmatism) and axis (the orientation\\nof astigmatism correction). If you have presbyopia, your doctor may also\\ndetermine your reading prescription. Eye exams can also check for eye diseases\\nso your doctor can prescribe the appropriate solution. For those with special\\neye conditions, you may need to see a specialist, such as a scleral\\noptometrist, to get the treatment and visual clarity your eyes need. Lens\\nCrafting After the examination, your optometrist sends the prescription to a\\nlab where your lenses will be crafted. Here, a machine cuts the lens into the\\nshape advised by your optometrist based on your prescription’s specifications.\\nLens Finishing Lastly, your lenses undergo additional treatments. These can\\ninclude anti-reflective or scratch-resistant coatings, color tints, or UV\\nprotection. These coatings improve the clarity and durability of your lenses.\\nTypes of Prescription Lenses There are various types of prescription lenses\\navailable to correct vision problems and suit individual needs. These lenses\\nare typically used in eyeglasses and may include single-vision lenses, with a\\nsingle prescription power throughout the entire lens. They correct\\nnearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. Bifocals have two different\\nprescription powers in a single lens. The upper part corrects distance vision,\\nwhile the lower is for near vision. They are commonly prescribed for\\nindividuals who have difficulty seeing both up close and at a distance. This\\ncondition is often seen in people over 40 with presbyopia. There are other\\nspecialty lenses available for specific needs, such as sports goggles and\\nlenses for low-vision individuals. The type of prescription lens you need\\ndepends on your vision correction requirements and lifestyle. An eye care\\nprofessional will assess your vision and recommend the most suitable lens type\\nfor your needs. Lumen Optometric is one of the area’s leading eye specialists.\\nFrom eye exams to dry eye treatment, you can count on us to provide quality\\neye care. We also offer neurolens treatment.

July 7, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Occasional headaches can be\\nmanageable for some people. But when these headaches begin to affect your\\neyesight or if your vision problems start coinciding with headaches, it can be\\na lot harder for anyone to bear. In this post, Lumen Optometric — a trusted\\nprovider of eyeglasses and contact lenses — discusses how headaches and vision\\ncan be interconnected. Types of Headaches That Can Affect Your Vision\\nMigraines and cluster headaches are the usual types of headache that can\\naffect your vision. Migraines are often described as intense pain in and\\naround the eyes. A “migraine aura” usually precedes them, and it often\\nresembles flashing lights, a prismatic rainbow of lights, or a zigzag pattern\\nof shimmering lights. Meanwhile, cluster headaches usually occur in clusters\\nand cause pain around the eyes. The pain typically radiates down the neck\\nincluding the shoulders and comes with other symptoms like red eyes, changes\\nin pupil size, eyelid droop, and nasal drainage. Vision Problems That Can\\nTrigger Headaches Headaches caused by vision problems usually start when the\\neyes are overworked and you can’t maintain focus. Make sure to visit an eye\\nexam doctor if you are experiencing any of the following: Eye Strain – This is\\ncommon among people who work in front of digital screens for several hours and\\nso they tend to overuse the focusing muscles of their eyes. When eye muscles\\nbecome fatigued, a headache can be felt specifically around or behind the\\neyes. Farsightedness – A frontal headache or brow ache may occur if a person\\nis farsighted. Farsightedness can make it difficult for a person to focus on\\nnearby objects, making it possible for eye strain and headaches to develop.\\nAcute Angle-Closure Glaucoma (AACG) – A rare type of glaucoma, it causes the\\neye pressure to rise quickly and often results in eye pain, eye redness,\\ncloudy vision, and an onset of headaches. Lumen Optometric offers exceptional\\neye care services. Our expertise includes orthokeratology, scleral lenses,\\nNeurolens® therapy, and more.

February 11, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Whether\\nyou’re working in a desk job or you’re attending online classes, there’s a big\\npossibility that you keep looking at a computer screen for hours on end. As\\nsuch, you may experience migraines from time to time. Migraines can cause\\nslight discomfort and may even affect your vision and ability to see clearly.\\nThere are two types of migraine you might have heard of: visual and ocular.\\nWhile both migraines involve changes in your vision, there are ways to tell\\nthem apart. Lumen Optometric, known for quality dry eye treatment services,\\nexplains the difference between visual and ocular migraines. Visual Migraine\\nVisual migraine is a temporary visual impairment that may occur simultaneously\\nin both eyes. Most visual migraines last for 30 minutes, but depending on your\\nstress levels and overall health, they may last longer. You may also\\nexperience a migraine headache shortly after a visual migraine. The symptoms\\nof visual migraine may vary. These include: Flickering blind spot in the\\ncenter or near the center of your peripheral fieldA wavy or zigzag ring of\\ncolored light surrounding a blind spotA blind spot that slowly migrates across\\nyour line of vision If you frequently experience any of these symptoms, you\\nshould consider contacting your optometrist for a neurolens treatment. Ocular\\nMigraine Ocular migraine, on the other hand, is a rarer type of migraine.\\nUnlike visual migraine, ocular migraine only affects one eye. It causes\\ntemporary loss of vision, which occurs when there is reduced blood flow in the\\neye. Ocular migraines can also be triggered because of blood vessel spasms in\\nthe retina. It typically lasts for about an hour, and vision eventually\\nreturns. In addition, the most common symptom of ocular migraine is the\\nappearance of a blind spot. This blind spot affects your field of vision and\\nnormally appears first in the center. As the migraine worsens, the blind spot\\ngrows and gradually blocks your entire field of vision. A migraine headache\\nmay also occur before, during, or after you experience ocular migraine. Visual\\nand ocular migraines are usually nothing to be worried about, and they will\\nresolve themselves within an hour or less. Nevertheless, if these types of\\nmigraine headaches persist, be sure to book an appointment with your eye\\ndoctor.

October 14, 2022 by Lumen\\nOptometric Virtual reality (VR) headsets are becoming more commonplace and are\\nnow being used for applications other than gaming and entertainment. Since VR\\nheadsets deliver audiovisual content, Lumen Optometric takes a look at whether\\nor not VR headsets are bad for the eyes. How Do VR Headsets Work? VR headsets\\nare head-mounted devices that consist of a display screen and stereo\\nearpieces, as well as sensors and controllers that create an interactive and\\nimmersive experience. Putting on a VR headset shuts out the immediate\\nsurroundings, which means the user can only see the content projected on the\\ndisplay screen. Its sensors adjust the content orientation, which allows the\\nuser to interact with a virtual space from any direction. While mostly known\\nfor their gaming applications, VR headsets can also be used for work and\\neducation. The Effects of VR on the Eyes Similar to devices that deliver\\naudiovisual content like TVs and smartphones, VR headsets present the same\\nrisks, including eye strain and fatigue, discomfort, and blurred vision.\\nStudies have shown that the human eye tends to blink less when using digital\\nscreens. Blinking helps remove contaminants from the eyes and keeps them moist\\nand a reduced blink rate can result in dry eyes. The eyes also tend to work\\nmore as the brain tries to reconcile the differences between virtual and\\nperceived depths. VR headsets also induce visually-induced motion sickness in\\nsome people. This “cybersickness” can persist long after the user has stopped\\nwearing the headset, the symptoms of which include headaches, lightheadedness,\\ndifficulty focusing, sweating, and nausea. People who are prone to motion\\nsickness or already have problems that affect their depth perception are\\nespecially susceptible to cybersickness. How to Take Care of Your Eyes if You\\nUse VR Headsets Fortunately, there are things that you can do to help reduce\\nthe effects of wearing VR headsets. The following can also be helpful if your\\ndaily routine involves prolonged use of digital screens: Follow the “20/20/20\\nRule”. Take breaks from using your VR headset and follow the 20/20/20 rule:\\nfor every 20 minutes you spend looking at a screen, look at something that’s\\n20 feet away for 20 seconds. Moisturize your eyes. In addition to taking\\nregular breaks, apply eye drops to keep your eyes moist. Limit your usage.\\nDon’t use the VR headset longer than you have to, particularly during late\\nhours. In addition to eye strain, the constant exposure to blue light emitted\\nby the screen can affect your body’s melatonin production and affect your\\nsleep cycles. Lastly, visit your eye doctor regularly to prevent further eye\\nproblems.

When it\\ndischarges through your tear ducts, they become overwhelmed, resulting in\\nwatery eyes. This usually gets resolved without treatment, but if this is a\\nrecurring problem, refrain from wearing any contact lenses and have your eyes\\nchecked at a trusted eye center. Common Causes Normally, you produce excess\\ntears when you feel certain emotions, as well as when you laugh, vomit, cough,\\nyawn, or experience strong taste sensations. However, in some cases, the cause\\nfor watery eyes can also be dry eye syndrome. With extremely dry eyes, you’re\\nnot able to receive proper lubrication and you’ll keep producing excess tears.\\nThis happens if your tears don’t contain the right balance of water, salt, and\\noils. Your eyes become irritated which causes the overproduction of tears to\\nspill through your tear ducts. Knowing When to See a Doctor Normally, your\\nwatery eyes will clear up without any treatment. But if it keeps happening,\\nyou’ll have to see your trusted eye exam doctor for a check-up. They’ll be\\nable to determine the cause of your dry eyes so they can administer the best\\ntreatment. Sometimes, the causes can be as simple as an injured or scratched\\neye. It can also be as obvious as swollen or red eyes. But other symptoms can\\nalso be tenderness around your nose or sinuses, as well as a severe headache\\nassociated with your watery eyes.

Increased quality of life: Treating myopia early on can help\\nimprove your child’s confidence by allowing them to participate in a wider\\nrange of activities. This can also help them excel at hobbies they currently\\nstruggle with due to their vision. Some studies show the relationship between\\nmyopia and mental health issues. Myopia management can lead to improved mental\\nhealth and overall happiness for your child. Long-term Benefits of Myopia\\nTreatment There are numerous long-term benefits to treating myopia early on,\\nwhich is where the Treehouse Eyes mission, “giving children better vision for\\nlife,” comes into play. 1\\\\. Reduce the risk of serious eye diseases: High\\nmyopia can lead to other serious eye diseases such as glaucoma, retinal\\ndetachments, macular degeneration, and cataracts. Early intervention to treat\\nmyopia is key so your Treehouse Eyes doctor can greatly reduce those risks for\\nyour child. 2\\\\. More Career Prospects: Some careers may require good vision\\nsuch as the military, aviation industry, surgeons and paramedics, or any\\nrescue team such as a firefighter or a lifeguard. By slowing down the\\nprogression of myopia, your child will have a larger range of opportunities\\nand won’t be held back by their myopia. 3\\\\. Lower healthcare costs: Treating\\nmyopia early might save your child higher vision care costs. Treatment of\\nother eye diseases can be expensive, so the earlier myopia is treated, the\\nless likely it could lead to an eye disease that is more serious. 4\\\\. Overall\\nImproved Quality of Life: People with myopia may experience day-to-day\\ndifficulties with things such as difficulties driving, playing sports, or\\nreading.

October 12, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Astigmatism is a fairly\\ncommon eye condition: about one in three people suffer from this condition.\\nThe cornea (the clear outer surface of the eyes) of patients with astigmatism\\nis shaped more like a football instead of a perfectly round ball (which is the\\nideal shape for your eyes). This irregular curve bends light more in one\\ndirection and causes blurry vision. Fortunately, moderate astigmatism can be\\neasily corrected using toric contact lenses. How are toric lenses different\\nfrom normal contact lenses? Lumen Optometric, your trusted scleral\\noptometrist, elaborates on the key features of toric lenses below: How the\\nShape of Toric Lenses Is Different Normal contacts have are spherical-shaped\\nwhereas toric lenses are shaped like the side of a donut. Thanks to this\\nunique shape, toric lenses have different refractive powers that can correct\\nastigmatism. They also have a small weight in their edges make sure your\\ncontacts return to their proper alignment after you blink. (Whenever you\\nblink, the contacts on your eye rotate.) Why It’s Important That Your Toric\\nContacts Fit Well It’s important that your contacts fit properly, but it’s\\nespecially so for toric lenses. That’s because ill-fitting toric lenses that\\nslip easily won’t be able to improve the clarity of your vision. What Are the\\nDifferent Types of Toric Lenses? Toric lenses are either made of soft or hard\\n(also known as rigid gas permeable) lenses. Soft lenses are comfortable to\\nwear, but hard lenses—which are more likely to stay in place—tend to perform\\nbetter than soft lenses. However, it usually takes a longer time to adjust to\\nhard lenses. If you want to learn more about toric lenses as well as other\\ntreatment options, like neurolens treatment, for other vision conditions,\\nconsult your eye doctor.

If you have plans with your soon-to-be\\nspouse, know that you don’t have to ditch your spectacles, especially if they\\nare what makes you distinct in terms of personality. Here are some pieces of\\nadvice from Lumen Optometric to help you get the most out of the look on your\\nwedding day. Make Your Glasses a Statement Piece You won’t be hard-pressed to\\nfind a stylish set of frames nowadays. In addition to vision correction, they\\ncan help enhance your appearance, especially when you wear your wedding\\noutfit. If you are getting a new pair before your big day, be sure that you\\ntreat it like jewelry. In other words, it should complement your dress or\\nsuit. Schedule a Custom Fitting Don’t go for the first frames you see right\\nfrom the shelf. Schedule a custom fitting with your future spouse so you can\\nfind the perfect pair of eyeglasses that will match the style you’re looking\\nfor. Your eye exam doctor can help you choose which frames suit you best,\\ntaking note of the shape and other details of your face as a guide. You’ll\\nwant them to be of the perfect size and fit, so you can wear them from the\\nwedding ceremony at church to the reception venue. Minimize the Glare It’s one\\nthing to get the perfect frame size and style, but it’s also another thing to\\nget the best prescription possible for vision correction. Your current\\nprescription may no longer work for you, and your next visit to your eye\\ndoctor is essential for determining whether you need a new one. While you’re\\nat it, why not ask about anti-reflective options? Expect many photo ops at the\\nwedding march and the reception, so lenses with this feature are a must-have\\nfor your new specs. At Lumen Optometric, we want to make sure that you will\\nget the best pair of eyewear possible that fits this important occasion. Apart\\nfrom this, you can count on us to provide other exceptional eye care services,\\nincluding neurolens therapy and corneal reshaping.

September 30, 2021\\nby Lumen Optometric Ill-fitting contacts can cause a host of problems,\\nincluding sensitivity to light, dry eyes, and contact lens intolerance (a\\ncondition that causes pain whenever contacts are worn). That’s why it’s\\nimportant that your contacts fit your eyes properly. The problem is that some\\ndiseases and conditions can make contact lens fitting harder. Lumen\\nOptometric, your trusted scleral optometrist, gives an overview below: Dry eye\\n– The surface of your eye needs to stay moist. Without sufficient lubrication\\nand moisture, the surface of your eye becomes more vulnerable to inflammation.\\nWearing contacts can also exacerbate issues related to dry eyes. That’s\\nbecause the lack of lubrication increases the friction between the eyes and\\ncontacts, increasing discomfort for lens wearers. Using artificial tears can\\nhelp alleviate symptoms of dry eye. However, certain formulations work better\\nthan others. That’s why if you need dry eye treatment, it’s best to consult\\nyour local eye doctor. Keratoconus – This is a progressive disease that causes\\ncorneas (the outer layer at the front of your eye that’s responsible for\\nfocusing light) to become thinner and bulge outward into a cone shape. The\\ncornea’s irregular shape distorts a patient’s vision and makes fitting\\ncontacts harder. Does This Mean Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes Still\\nWear Contacts? Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes need to wear custom-\\nmolded scleral lenses, which are larger than gas permeable contact lenses.\\nThanks to their large size, they can cover the entire corneal surface. Since\\nscleral lenses rest on the less sensitive part of the sclera or the white\\nouter layer of the eye, patients with Keratoconus don’t usually experience\\ndiscomfort when using them. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of\\nprofessional eye care services, including scleral lens fitting and neurolens\\ntreatment services. Our proprietor Dr. Eric To is the only practice-owning\\noptometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the\\nScleral Lens Society. As such, you can rest easy knowing that our team has\\nundergone advanced training to provide the clearest and healthiest vision for\\nour patients.

May 10, 2021 by Lumen Optometric The drastic\\nincrease in the number of children diagnosed with myopia during the past\\ndecade is astonishing — but is it surprising? Not really. When you analyze the\\ncauses of myopia, it becomes clear why more and more children are becoming\\naffected by this progressive eye disease. What Is Myopia? Myopia, often\\nreferred to as nearsightedness, is an eye disease in which the eye elongates\\nmore than it should, causing light to be focused in front of the retina\\ninstead of on the retina’s surface. Essentially, your child’s eye is growing\\ntoo long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body,\\nnaturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in\\nearly adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development\\nwhere they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription\\ndue to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred\\ndistance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty\\nseeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors lead a child to develop\\nmyopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status.\\nGenetics A child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is\\nnearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances\\nincrease even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or\\nyour spouse are myopic. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all\\nover the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of\\ntheir day, whether reading a book, using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or\\nanother device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially\\nin excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and\\nprogression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration\\nof near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating\\nnovel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a\\nmagazine a few minutes at a time. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least\\n2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in\\nchildren. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day,\\nespecially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Other Risk Factors\\nAssociated with Myopia Height — taller children and adolescents have a higher\\nincidence of myopia than their shorter counterpartsEducation level — There is\\na higher incidence of myopia in people with advanced degrees, as well as\\nhigher parental education levels.Ethnicity — Individuals from Asian/Pacific\\nIslander communities are more at risk of developing myopia. If Your Child Has\\nMyopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously\\naffect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood\\nsignificantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and\\nconditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular\\ndegeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia can be effectively\\nmanaged to reduce the risk of future eye disease. At Treehouse Eyes, we offer\\nthe latest and most effective myopia management treatments to limit the\\nprogression of myopia so that your child can live his or her best life.

November 10, 2023\\nby Lumen Optometric Taking care of your eyes starts right at home. So, how can\\nyou make your home safer for your eyes? A few simple practices can\\nsignificantly reduce the risk of accidental eye injuries. Continue reading to\\nlearn why practicing eye safety at home is important and how to maintain good\\neye health. The Importance of Eye Safety at Home Eye safety at home is\\nessential for several reasons. For one, it helps prevent accidents and\\ninjuries that can lead to vision problems. Many preventable eye injuries occur\\nright in the comfort of our homes. From minor irritations to major injuries,\\nour eyes face potential hazards from everyday household items. Therefore,\\nhaving an eye safety routine can go a long way in preventing eye health\\nissues. Furthermore, eye safety at home is indispensable for preserving your\\nvision and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By being proactive and taking\\nnecessary precautions, you can reduce the risk of eye injuries and conditions\\nthat may have a lasting impact on your visual health. Maintaining Your Eye\\nHealth at Home Paying attention to your eye health is essential for preserving\\nyour vision and preventing eye-related problems. Here are some tips to\\nmaintain healthy eyes. Regular Eye Examinations One way to keep your eyes\\nhealthy is to have regular eye exams with your doctor. These exams help catch\\npotential vision issues early and allow your doctor to prescribe corrective\\nglasses or contact lenses or recommend other necessary treatments. Protective\\nEyewear Whether you’re doing crafts, cleaning your home, or mowing the garden,\\nwear protective eyewear. Goggles, for instance, form a physical barrier\\nbetween your eyes and potential hazards, minimizing the risk of eye injury.\\nSafe Use of Cosmetics and Cleaning Products If improperly used or stored,\\ncosmetics and cleaning products pose a significant eye hazard. Therefore,\\nconsider eye safety while using and storing these substances and close your\\nproducts securely. Adopting Healthy Habits Adequate nutrition, regular breaks\\nfrom screen time, and ensuring sufficient lighting while reading and working\\nare simple yet effective practices to keep your eyes healthy. Monitoring\\nVision Changes Take note of any changes in your vision. Contact your eye care\\nprofessional immediately if you feel discomfort or notice changes. If you want\\nto schedule an analysis of your eye health, contact Lumen Optometric at (626)\\n921-0199 or fill out our online form to schedule a consultation. We also offer\\nother services, such as orthokeratology, myopia management and neurolens\\ntherapy.

June 14, 2022 by Lumen Optometric An annual eye exam is one of the best\\nways to keep your eyes healthy. Since you’ll only be seeing your eye doctor\\nonce a year, you need to make the most of it. That includes asking the\\nimportant questions pertaining to the current state of your eyesight. Lumen\\nOptometric lists some of them below. “Are My Eyes Healthy?” If your doctor\\ndetects a disease during the eye exam such as age-related macular degeneration\\nor glaucoma, they will educate you thoroughly and advise you how to safeguard\\nyour eyes. However, even if you haven’t been diagnosed with such, it’s best to\\nprioritize your wellness, especially when it comes to your vision. Be sure to\\nask your doctor if there are ways to improve your vision and ocular health.\\nThey will be able to present you with options to retain your healthy eyesight.\\n“Are There Any Changes I Should Do to Protect My Eyes?” Several eye diseases\\nhave been linked to UV exposure, from cataracts to eye cancers. Sunglasses can\\nprevent these issues, but your eye doctor may recommend UV-blocking contact\\nlenses to block the peripheral light that sunglasses cannot block. If you are\\nalready wearing a contact lens, you can replace your lenses as prescribed by\\nyour doctor. “Are Digital Devices Affecting My Eyesight?” More than 83% of\\nAmericans use digital devices for more than two hours each day, which can lead\\nto digital eye strain. Common symptoms include eye strain, headaches, blurred\\nvision, and dry eyes. During the eye exam, your eye doctor can suggest several\\ntips to alleviate digital eye strain. These may include offering dry eye\\ntreatment, changing the lighting and display settings, or wearing specialized\\nprescriptions, including contact lenses. “When Should I Return for My Next\\nVisit?” Depending on your age, vision, and medical history, your eye doctor\\nwill determine how often you need an exam. Staying on schedule is crucial,\\nespecially if you have underlying eye conditions that need to be treated. Most\\neye care centers may schedule your next appointment right away. Otherwise, be\\nsure to set a reminder on your phone. Here at Lumen Optometric, our eye care\\nprofessionals are happy to assist you with your eye health concerns. We also\\nprovide top-quality eye care services, including neurolens treatment and more.\\nGive us a call at (626) 921-0199 or fill out our online contact form to book\\nan appointment.

Children frequently experience myopia progression, which lowers\\ntheir quality of life and increases risks to their eye health. Myopia control\\ntreatments are now able to improve children’s vision and promote long-term eye\\nhealth. Read on to find out more! What is Myopia? People with myopia have\\nblurred vision when looking at objects from a distance. When myopia worsens,\\nthe blur can become noticeable even when the object is close to or at arm’s\\nlength. Near-sightedness or short-sightedness are other names for it. Myopia\\nusually begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 14 and generally becomes\\nprogressively worse every several months in children. It results from the\\neyes’ rapid and excessive expansion relative to the usual pace of eye growth.\\nThe eyes should continue to expand consistently in size until adolescence,\\nthen stabilize. However, with myopia, the eyes develop too quickly, causing\\nrapid and continuous vision loss as well as ongoing eye growth into\\nadolescence and even early adulthood. Myopia progression is the term used to\\ndescribe this continuing deterioration. What is Myopia Control? The use of\\ntreatments intended to stop the advancement of myopia is known as “myopia\\ncontrol.” These treatments include atropine eye drops, soft contact lenses,\\northo-k, and special types of glasses. Myopia control is especially crucial\\nfor children, as it is in this age group that myopia is most likely to\\nprogress or worsen quickly. Both myopia management and myopia control are\\nphrases used to refer to the additional clinical care needed for myopic\\nchildren and adults. Myopia control typically entails using eye drops,\\ncontacts, or glasses to stop the progression of myopia. Myopia control is a\\nbroad term that encompasses maintaining eye health as well as various\\nlifestyle and environmental factors that may contribute to the advancement of\\nmyopia. What are The Advantages of Myopia Control? The primary advantage of\\ntreating myopia is to reduce the risks associated with high myopia. Those with\\nhigh degrees of myopia will have increased risk for diseases such as glaucoma,\\nretinal detachments, and myopic maculopathy. Myopia requires the use of\\nspectacles or contact lenses to treat blurry distance vision. If your myopia\\nis lower, you will be more functional in the mornings before putting on your\\ncontacts or glasses. You’ll be able to work a little better without them as\\nopposed to becoming totally incapacitated without them. Additionally, a lower\\nprescription increases the likelihood that your child will be a good candidate\\nfor laser eye surgery as an adult to correct their myopia, as well as the\\nlikelihood that they will have better visual results after surgery. What Else\\nShould I know? Numerous studies have demonstrated that a child’s or teen’s\\nvisual environment can raise their chances of developing and progressing\\nmyopia. When creating the visual environment, do increase the duration of\\noutdoor time your child has. Talk to your eye doctor or optometrist about the\\nideal duration they should spend outdoors and on screens and/or reading to\\ncontrol your child’s myopia. These can play a significant role in ensuring the\\noptimum results from myopia control treatments.

Always be careful when participating in activities that involve\\nsharp items and flying objects. One way to ensure your eyes are safe while\\nyou’re playing sports is wearing the proper safety eyewear. Keep in mind that\\nconventional glasses won’t give your eyes the protection they need. A local\\neye exam doctor shares facts about sports eye safety. Blinding Injuries Can\\nOccur From Combat Sports People participating in boxing and full-contact\\nmartial arts are at significant risk of severe eye injuries that can lead to\\nblindness. While there’s no standard eye protection for boxing, using\\nthumbless gloves can help reduce eye injuries related to the sport. Basketball\\nIs the Leading Cause of Sports-Related Injuries Most sports-related eye\\ninjuries in the U.S. occur while playing basketball. It is followed by\\nsoftball, baseball, airsoft rifles, pellet guns, racquetball and hockey. When\\nplaying these sports, you must wear protective glasses with shatterproof,\\npolycarbonate lenses. It pays to invest in protective eyewear that meets the\\nAmerican Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. At Lumen\\nOptometric, we’re here to help choose which glasses or contact lenses are most\\nsuitable for your activity. Consider Your Risks If one of your eyes already\\nhas reduced vision, think hard before participating in a sport with a high\\nrisk of eye injury. Are you willing to risk your other eye? Consult your eye\\ndoctor to find out what kind of eye protection you need. They might also\\nadvise or discourage you from playing high-risk sports, depending on the\\ncondition of your eyes.

This is especially bad when the person\\nhas ocular misalignment, allowing for a condition termed trigeminal dysphoria.\\nThe premier corneal reshaping specialist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares\\nmore details about trigeminal dysphoria and how you can alleviate its\\nsymptoms. Who is At-Risk of Trigeminal Dysphoria? People who experience\\ntrigeminal dysphoria–about 90% of them, in fact, according to studies–have\\nocular misalignment when viewing nearby objects instead of at a distance. This\\nmeans their regular and continued use of digital devices becomes even more\\nproblematic since the task involves full-on near vision. To compensate for\\nthis problem, their vision must work overtime. This, in turn, puts a strain on\\nthe trigeminal nerve–the largest and most complex nerve connected to the\\nbrain. When the trigeminal nerve is triggered, these allow for symptoms that\\ninclude headaches, eye strain, light sensitivity, and neck and shoulder pain.\\nHow Do You Confirm You Have Trigeminal Dysphoria? The symptoms mentioned above\\nare also associated with a number of eye conditions. To determine whether you\\nactually have trigeminal dysphoria, you should visit a trusted local eye exam\\ndoctor like Lumen Optometric. Our trained and skilled eye care specialists\\nwill perform a comprehensive checkup of your eyes and accurately determine the\\nroot of its problem. If the results are indeed trigeminal dysphoria, we can\\noffer a safe and effective way to alleviate its symptoms. What is Neurolens\\nTreatment Technology? Lumen Optometric is the only neurolens treatment\\nprovider in the San Gabriel Valley. With the use of advanced and customized\\nlenses, we can correct your specific ocular misalignment so you won’t have to\\nstruggle to see up close or far away. This means a reduced potential for\\nsymptoms involved with trigeminal dysphoria, allowing only for the most\\ncomfortable vision possible. Neurolens utilizes different technology to\\nconventional contact lenses. To ensure you get the specialized lenses that can\\nperfectly fit your eyes and help with your specific symptoms, Lumen Optometric\\nwill measure your eye misalignment using sophisticated equipment, SightSync.\\nYou’ll start noticing vision improvements with neuronlens within the\\nweek–those with extremely chronic conditions, however, may require at least\\nsix weeks before they can see the difference. Lumen Optometric is your go-to\\nspecialist for safe and effective alleviation of trigeminal dysphoria\\nsymptoms. We proudly serve Sierra Madre, CA and the rest of San Gabriel\\nValley.

October 12, 2023 by Lumen Optometric\\nHave you ever asked, “Why are my eyes so dry?” Turns out, this is not an\\nuncommon issue, and many face it, especially in this digital age. There could\\nbe multiple reasons, from environmental factors to something more serious.\\nRead on to learn more about dry eyes, including the main causes and treatment\\noptions. Main Causes of Dry Eyes Several factors can contribute to dry eyes:\\nAging. With age, our tear production naturally decreases. This is why people\\nover 50 are more likely to experience dry eye symptoms. Gender. Hormonal\\nchanges, particularly during pregnancy, using oral contraceptives or\\nmenopause, can cause dry eyes in women. Environmental Conditions. Dry, windy,\\nsmoky or dusty conditions can increase tear evaporation. Also, spending long\\nhours looking at the computer screen can reduce the blink rate, drying your\\neyes out. Medications. Certain drugs, including antihistamines, decongestants,\\nblood pressure medications and antidepressants, can reduce tear production.\\nHealth Conditions. Certain health issues can cause dry eyes, such as Sjogren’s\\nsyndrome, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid problems. How to Treat\\nDry Eyes Treatment for dry eyes typically aims at restoring or maintaining the\\nnormal amount of tears in the eye to minimize dryness and related discomfort.\\nHere are some of the most common: Artificial Tears. Over-the-counter eye drops\\nthat mimic your natural tears may relieve mild cases of dry eyes. Lifestyle\\nChanges. Taking breaks during long tasks, avoiding air blowing in your eyes\\nand adding moisture to the air at home or work can help. Prescription\\nMedications. Certain prescription drugs can help increase tear production.\\nSpecial Procedures. In severe cases, various procedures can be used, like\\nclosing your tear ducts to reduce tear loss or using special contact lenses.\\nIf you’ve tried home care methods and over-the-counter solutions without\\nsuccess, it’s time to see a doctor. Seek immediate medical attention if you\\nhave: Unbearable eye discomfort A significant decrease in vision Other\\nsymptoms like redness, swelling or discharge Dry Eye Treatment at Lumen\\nOptometric At Lumen Optometric, we understand that every individual is unique.\\nHence, our treatments for dry eye syndrome are personalized to cater to your\\nneeds.

August 3, 2021 by Lumen Optometric People who get new eyeglasses can\\nsometimes experience discomfort. Some get nose pain and marks, while others\\nfeel eye strain or ear pain. To avoid these issues when getting new glasses or\\ncontact lenses, it is important to work with a reliable eye care professional.\\nHere are possible reasons your new eyeglasses might be uncomfortable to wear.\\nYour Eyeglasses Are Loose If your eyeglasses feel like they are falling every\\ntime you move, it could be that they are too loose around your ears. You can\\ntry to run your glasses under warm water and slightly bend the temple arms\\ndown. Another solution is to get eyeglasses in smaller frames that best fit\\nyour face shape. You Have a Low Nose Bridge You may have a low nose bridge if\\nyour eyeglasses slip down when you tilt your head. If this is the case, you\\nmay need the help of your eye exam doctor to find glasses that are suitable\\nfor lower nose bridges. They may suggest getting rectangular or horn-rimmed\\nglasses. Moreover, you can also try adjusting the nose pads of your glasses\\ninward, so they sit more securely to your nose. Your Glasses Are Not Set\\nCorrectly When glasses leave marks on your nose bridge, it could be that they\\nare not set correctly. It is easy to adjust the nose pads of your glasses, so\\nthey sit on your nose properly. Your optician may also adjust them or change\\nthem with another material, such as silicone, acetate, or nylon. If you have a\\nplastic frame, it’s possible that they are too heavy or the bridge may not be\\nbig enough. You may want to consider investing in eyeglass frames with a wider\\nbridge or lighter-weight lenses. Incorrect Pupillary Distance Measurement You\\nmay still get headaches from properly sized eyeglasses if it has an incorrect\\npupillary distance (PD) measurement. PD refers to the distance between your\\npupils and is necessary for eyeglass wear comfort. Mistakes on PD are common\\nfor people who get their prescription glasses. Lumen Optometric is here to\\nassist with your eye care needs. Besides glasses and contacts, we also offer\\nneuro lens and corneal reshaping therapy.

Usually, you won’t notice\\nsignificant changes in your vision until your 40s. It isn’t uncommon for older\\nadults to experience difficulty in reading small print or need more light to\\nsee clearly. Learn why it happens from a local orthokeratology specialist.\\nAging Eyes: Why Do They Need More Light? In your 40s, the lenses of your eyes\\ncan start to turn yellow and get more rigid. It can reduce the amount of light\\nthat enters your eyes and affect color accuracy and focus. As you age, your\\ncorneas can thicken and become more opaque. Your pupils can also begin to\\nshrink. These changes can further decrease and diffuse the light that reaches\\nyour eyes. Individuals who are 65 and older might need more light to see\\nclearly. Their eyes might take longer to adjust from light to dark\\nenvironments and vice versa. It can be more challenging for older adults to\\nfocus on nearby objects. They can also experience sensitivity to glare. Tips\\nto Help You Adjust to Vision Changes See Your Eye Doctor Regularly Regardless\\nof age, you must see an eye exam doctor regularly. Doing so helps in detecting\\nand treating vision-threatening conditions in their early stages. Macular\\ndegeneration, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the most common eye problems\\nin older adults. They don’t usually show early signs, and you might not know\\nyou have them until they have progressed. Make Necessary Changes to Your Home\\nPeople who are 65 and older often need twice as much light as young adults to\\nsee well. You can make your living space safer by increasing ambient light.\\nConsider adding dimmer switches so each family member can easily adjust the\\nroom’s illumination depending on their needs. Place task lighting wherever\\nthey are necessary. It’s also essential that light switches are easy to\\naccess. Don’t wait for your vision to change before seeing an eye doctor.

In your New Year’s resolutions, it would be great if you could include\\nthings that can help with your vision and eye health. For instance, seeing an\\neye exam doctor regularly. Here’s what you can include in your vision and eye\\nhealth resolutions for 2022. Reducing Screen Time Today, people spend more\\ntime on screens than ever before. However, excessive screen time can be\\ndetrimental to your eyes. It can increase your risk of developing dry eye\\nsyndrome, a condition that can cause your eyes to become red, dry, and itchy.\\nIf you have a job that requires you to use the computer for hours, make sure\\nto give your eyes a break every once in a while. Practice Healthy Contact Lens\\nWear Contact lenses are a great option for people who don’t prefer to wear\\nglasses. Using contacts is safe as long you practice good hygiene, wear them\\nproperly, and follow your eye doctor’s recommendations. You should avoid\\nwearing contacts for extended periods, reusing old solution, and handling\\nlenses without washing your hands. Avoid Constant Eye Rubbing While it may be\\ntempting to rub your eyes when they are itchy, you shouldn’t. Doing so will\\nonly worsen the problem and put too much pressure on your eyes or even scratch\\nthem. You can use a cold compress if your eyes keep itching. If it feels like\\nthere’s something inside your eye, gently flush it with water. However, if the\\nsensation persists, it’s best to see your eye doctor. Wear Proper Eye\\nProtection The sun’s ultraviolet rays can be extremely harmful to your eyes.\\nWhen going outside, make sure to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Moreover, use\\nprotective eyewear when swimming, cooking with oil, doing home improvements,\\nand other activities that risk eye injuries or involve chemicals.

June 17, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Cataracts are commonly\\nassociated with the elderly; however, children and young adults can also\\ndevelop them. It might sound surprising, but various circumstances and\\nconditions can result in cataracts at any age. Let’s explore how cataracts\\naren’t strictly an age-related condition. Dispelling the Misconception About\\nAge and Cataracts While cataracts are most common among the elderly, it is a\\nfallacy to say they are exclusively an age-related condition. For various\\nreasons, children and young adults can also develop cataracts, even if they’re\\nwearing contact lenses. For instance, newborns can be afflicted with\\ncataracts, a condition known as congenital cataracts. This congenital eye\\nproblem can be hereditary or caused by infections during pregnancy. Likewise,\\nyoung adults can acquire what are known as secondary cataracts due to certain\\ndiseases like diabetes or lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and excessive\\ndrinking. Symptoms and Detection of Cataracts in Young People Symptoms of\\ncataracts can be quite similar across all age groups, including blurred or\\ncloudy vision and difficulty with night vision. Regular comprehensive eye\\nexams are crucial to detecting and managing this condition early. Your eye\\nexam doctor is instrumental in this process, identifying signs that may be\\noverlooked without professional evaluation. Management and Treatment of\\nPediatric and Young Adult Cataracts Treatment options for cataracts in young\\npeople depend on the severity of the condition and the individual’s age. In\\nsome cases, glasses or contact lenses may be sufficient to improve vision. For\\nmore advanced cataracts, surgery to remove the clouded lens and replace it\\nwith an artificial one may be necessary.

May 20, 2024 by Lumen Optometric It’s tempting to imagine that better\\neyesight can be achieved simply by adding a few vitamins to your daily\\nroutine. Although certain vitamins can influence eye health, these shouldn’t\\nreplace a well-balanced diet. Before you rush off to buy these supplements,\\nit’s important to note that these over-the-counter vitamins may not always\\nbring the desired results and could sometimes even cause harm. Find out what\\nthe experts say regarding the effects of eye vitamins. What Are Over-the-\\nCounter Eye Vitamins? Over-the-counter eye vitamins are non-prescription\\nsupplements that may have the potential to enhance your eye health. You can\\nfind them in various forms, from tablets and capsules to liquid and powder.\\nCan Eye Vitamins Improve Vision? Some studies suggest that specific vitamins\\nmay promote eye health and improve vision. However, these supplements don’t\\nguarantee vision improvement for everyone. Their effect can differ based on\\nindividual health conditions and lifestyle. Vitamins That Can Influence Vision\\nand Eye Health Several vitamins prove essential in maintaining healthy eyes.\\nFor instance, vitamins A, C and E are antioxidant vitamins that can help\\nprevent age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of severe vision\\nloss. On the other hand, B vitamins such as niacin and folic acid may reduce\\nthe risk of certain eye conditions. Balanced Diet vs. Supplement Intake\\nDespite the potential benefits of these vitamins, remember that the safest and\\nmost effective way to acquire these nutrients is via a balanced diet. A diet\\nrich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats can provide the\\nessential nutrients your body needs for overall health, including your eyes.\\nSupplements should not replace a balanced diet but can serve as an excellent\\nadditional tool in case of deficiency or certain health conditions. Importance\\nof Consultation Before Taking Supplements Think twice before grabbing eye\\nvitamins off the shelf! Before beginning any dietary supplement regimen, let\\nyour eye doctor guide you on the best approach to supporting your eye health.\\nSelf-prescription could lead to overconsumption, which can potentially cause\\nhealth risks. If you need expert advice on any eye health concerns, contact\\nLumen Optometric. You can reach us at (626) 921-0199 or book an appointment\\nanytime via our contact page.

Prolonged screen time can overwork your\\neyes and lead to eye strain, but the good news is that there are simple\\nexercises that can help relax and refresh your eyes. Lumen Optometric, your\\ngo-to provider of orthokeratology and other eye care solutions, shares five\\nexercises that are specifically designed to minimize eye discomfort. Eye\\nStrain Explained Also known as asthenopia, eye strain is a common condition\\ncharacterized by discomfort in and around the eyes. These are often caused by\\nactivities requiring intense use of the eyes, such as reading, driving, or\\nscreen time, and the usual symptoms include dryness, redness, blurred vision,\\nlight sensitivity, and headaches. When you constantly fix your gaze on digital\\nscreens, your eyes have to incessantly focus and refocus, causing eye strain.\\nExercises To Prevent Eye Strain The following simple exercises can\\nsignificantly reduce eye strain when incorporated into your daily routine: The\\n20-20-20 Rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something\\n20 feet away. This technique allows your eyes to rest from the intensity of\\nthe computer or smartphone screen. Blinking. This refreshes and moistens your\\neyes, which can prevent dryness and irritation. Palming. Rub your palms\\ntogether to warm them, then place them gently over your closed eyes. Feel your\\neyes relax while you breathe deeply. Eye-Rolling. Close your eyes and roll\\nthem gently in a circular motion. This helps to relieve tension around the\\neyes. Focusing Exercises. Hold your thumb six inches away from your face and\\nfocus on it for five seconds. Then, focus on an object 20 feet away for\\nanother five seconds. Switch back and forth. This exercise helps train your\\neyes. The Importance of Professional Eye Care While these eye exercises can\\nhelp prevent eye strain, it’s equally important to have regular, comprehensive\\neye checks done by an eye exam doctor. These exams will help in the early\\nidentification of any potential eye-related issues. Let Lumen Optometric Take\\nCare of Your Vision Eye strain is a widespread issue, but the good news is\\nthat it can be managed effectively through regular exercises and professional\\neye care. For top-notch eye care solutions, turn to the best in Sierra Madre,\\nCalifornia. At Lumen Optometric, we’ve got you covered, from orthokeratology\\nto top-quality contact lenses.

Unfortunately, it also brings\\nfactors that can affect your eye health and vision. Understanding these\\nfactors can help you protect your eyesight and enjoy all winter offers without\\nworry or discomfort. Complications of Cold Weather on Eye Health During colder\\ntemperatures, your eyes may suffer several complications that warrant an eye\\nexam. Dry Eyes: The cold weather often reduces the amount of moisture in the\\nair, resulting in dry eyes for many people. Due to reduced humidity levels\\ninside homes or offices and increased wind speeds, it can be difficult for\\ntears to form normally. This can lead to irritation, redness, itching and\\nburning sensations around the eyes that may cause further complications if\\nleft untreated. Wind and Dust: During colder temperatures, wind gusts are much\\nstronger than usual, which increases dust particles being blown into our eyes.\\nThis can cause irritation and potential damage to sensitive structures within\\nour ocular areas, such as the conjunctiva (the white part) or cornea (the\\nclear front layer). Sun Glare: With sun glare reflecting off ice crystals in\\nthe sky combined with strong winds blowing snowflakes across areas where there\\nshould be little obstruction from sunlight, there is an increased risk for UV\\nexposure. This can cause temporary issues such as headaches and long-term\\ndamage, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), over prolonged\\nperiods if protection isn’t taken seriously. Prevention Tips for Eye Health in\\nWinter Here’s what you can do to protect your eyes from the cold: Wear\\nProtective Eyewear: Wearing protective eyewear will help reduce exposure\\nlevels significantly while allowing us to see better under harsh conditions.\\nProtective eyewear contains polarized lenses providing clearer images even\\nwhen light reflects off surfaces like bodies of water or icy grounds. We\\nrecommend investing in quality frames/lenses designed against UV radiation to\\nkeep your vision intact. Hydrate: We suggest drinking plenty of fluids\\nthroughout days spent outdoors this season, not only because staying hydrated\\nhelps fight dryness caused by winds but also because a lack thereof could lead\\nto negative impacts. Take Breaks from Screens: Staring at screens for\\nprolonged periods can cause eyestrain and fatigue, leading to redness,\\nitchiness, dry eyes and other complications. Taking regular breaks from any\\ndigital device, especially when wearing contact lenses, helps give your eyes a\\nbreak so they can rest and recuperate more effectively. Eat Nutritious Foods:\\nEating nutritious foods rich in vitamins and minerals, such as dark leafy\\ngreens, sweet potatoes and oily fish, is important because these substances\\ncan help strengthen eye structures against external factors like dryness and\\nwind. They provide nutrients that benefit long-term vision health, reducing\\nrisks associated with certain conditions, including AMD (age-related macular\\ndegeneration) and cataracts. Visit an eye exam doctor: If you are experiencing\\nany of the symptoms mentioned above or if you have any questions about how to\\nprotect your eyes during winter, consult an eye doctor.

January 11, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Regular eye exams are an important\\npart of a child’s healthcare. Pediatric eye exams can detect vision problems\\nearly and help children develop the skills they need to succeed in school and\\nbeyond. A scleral optometrist discusses the ideal schedule for pediatric eye\\nexams here. What Is a Pediatric Eye Exam? A pediatric eye exam is a\\ncomprehensive assessment of your child’s eyesight. During the appointment, an\\noptometrist will evaluate how well your child can see from near and far\\ndistances, their peripheral vision and depth perception, and any underlying\\nconditions or diseases that could affect their vision. How Often Should\\nPediatric Eye Exams Be Scheduled? The American Optometric Association (AOA)\\nrecommends that all children receive comprehensive pediatric eye examinations\\nat least once between the ages of 3 to 5 years old, followed by yearly\\ncheckups until age 18 (or 21 if still in school). However, certain risk\\nfactors may increase the frequency with which these appointments should occur.\\nIssues such as premature birth or family history of ocular diseases, like\\nglaucoma, cataracts, retinopathy, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, strabismus\\n(crossed-eyes) and uncorrected refractive error, may make your child prone to\\ncertain eye health problems. Even dry eye, a natural part of aging, affect\\nchildren and require them to undergo dry eye treatment. In these cases, it’s\\nbest to consult your optometrist, who will create an individualized plan based\\non your needs and risk factors in your family history and medical records.\\nWhat To Expect During An Eye Exam When you bring your little one for an eye\\nexam, the doctor will conduct various tests to assess their eyes’ health and\\nfunction. These tests may include: Visual acuity test – This measures how your\\nchild can see at different distances. Refraction test – An examination to\\ndetermine whether corrective lenses are needed for optimal vision. Color\\nblindness test – A simple screening tool that checks for color deficiencies.\\nSlit lamp exam – Used to check for any signs of infection or damage on the\\neye’s surface. Retinoscopy/autorefractor – A method doctors use to measure\\nrefractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. If\\nyou’re looking for a comprehensive pediatric eye exam in Sierra Madre, CA,\\nlook no further than Lumen Optometric. Our team of experienced optometrists\\nwill work with you to ensure that your child’s vision is healthy and they’re\\nseeing their best.

If\\nso, they might be experiencing a common vision problem known as myopia or\\nnearsightedness. Alarmingly, studies show that childhood myopia rates are on\\nthe rise globally. Read on as Lumen Optometric shares crucial insights into\\nthis escalating issue, its impact on children’s vision, and how early\\ndetection and treatment can make all the difference. Understanding Myopia\\nMyopia, often known as nearsightedness, is a condition where objects up close\\nare seen clearly, while objects farther away appear blurred. Usually\\ndeveloping in childhood, myopia occurs when the eye grows too long, preventing\\nlight from focusing directly on the retina. This irregularity causes distant\\nobjects to appear blurry, which could mean your child is struggling to see the\\nschool board or having difficulty playing sports. How an Eye Exam Doctor Can\\nHelp Detect Myopia An eye exam doctor plays a critical role in the early\\ndetection of myopia. During your child’s regular eye exams, they can\\naccurately measure your child’s vision and eye health, diagnosing myopia and\\nother potential vision problems. Remember, early intervention can prevent your\\nchild’s eyesight issues from worsening. Treatment Options for Childhood Myopia\\nOnce diagnosed, effective treatment options are available. One common approach\\nis to prescribe contact lenses. These are usually worn during the day and\\nremoved at night, aiding in clear distant vision. Another advanced treatment\\noption is orthokeratology, a non-surgical procedure that gradually reshapes\\nthe eye’s curvature using specially designed contact lenses. One advantage of\\nthis process is that it slows down the progression of myopia in children,\\nproviding a more long-term solution. How Lumen Optometric Can Help At Lumen\\nOptometric, we’re dedicated to providing comprehensive eye care for your\\nchild. Based in Sierra Madre, CA, our team of eye doctors has the expertise to\\ndiagnose and treat myopia in children.

Eye safety hazards during sports can range from\\nminor scratches to severe trauma that can cause permanent vision loss.\\nChoosing the right sports eye safety gear is crucial to protect your eyes from\\npotential harm. In this article, we explore the different types of sports eye\\nsafety gear available and how to choose the right one for your needs.\\nIdentifying Your Needs When choosing the right sports eyewear, it is important\\nto consider the type of sport you are playing and the level of intensity. For\\ninstance, you may need different protection for a non-contact or low-intensity\\nsport like golf than for a full-contact team sport like football. Choosing the\\nappropriate eye protection will help protect your eyes while allowing you to\\nplay comfortably and safely. Features to Consider When selecting the right\\nsports eye safety gear, these are the features you should consider. Fit\\nRegardless of the type of activity you’re participating in, your eye doctor\\nwill recommend choosing eyewear that fits. Your eye gear should fit snugly and\\ncomfortably without slipping or moving during activity. Look for eyewear with\\nadjustable straps or nose pads to ensure a proper fit. Comfort Your eyewear\\nshould also be comfortable to wear for extended periods. Look for soft padding\\nor cushioning around the eyes. Lightweight materials that won’t bother you\\nduring activity are also excellent choices. Durability Sports eye safety gear\\nshould withstand impact and other potential hazards. Look for durable\\nmaterials that can withstand rough handling. Polycarbonate lenses or frames\\nmade from strong plastics or metals work great for this purpose. Visibility\\nChoose sports eye safety gear that doesn’t impede your vision. It should also\\nprovide you with a wide field of vision and have anti-fog coatings, so you can\\nsee clearly during activity. Additionally, it may be worth investing in\\nimpact-resistant lenses if you play contact sports. They absorb shock better\\nthan regular ones but still provide clear visibility even under extreme\\nconditions. Lens Tint The tint of the lens is also an important consideration\\nas it can affect your vision in different lighting conditions. Clear lenses\\nsuit low-light conditions, while tinted or polarized lenses can reduce glare\\nand improve visibility in bright sunlight. Shopping Tips Once you have\\nidentified your needs, research different brands and read customer reviews to\\ncompare features and quality. It is also worth asking for recommendations from\\nfriends or family who play the same sport. If you’re looking for eye exam\\ndoctors or orthokeratology or optometry specialists in Sierra Madre, CA, to\\nhelp you pick the right eyewear for your preferred sport, Lumen Optometric can\\nhelp.

October\\n26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is an\\nincredibly prevalent vision condition, affecting around 30% of Americans, with\\nan estimated 20-25 million children untreated in the United States alone. It\\ndevelops when the eyeball grows longer from front to back than normal, with\\nthe symptom of blurry distance vision. Myopia tends to begin in childhood and\\nworsen over time. This leads many to wonder – is nearsightedness genetic?\\nLet’s explore the evidence surrounding myopia’s hereditary patterns. Research\\nShows a Strong Genetic Link Extensive research, including twin studies, family\\npatterns, and genetic mapping, provides compelling evidence that genetics play\\na significant role in myopia. While environmental factors can also influence\\nmyopia risk, the hereditary component cannot be ignored. Specific genetic\\nvariations affecting eye growth, development, and refraction have been\\nidentified that predispose people to nearsightedness. These genes often relate\\nto connective tissues, neurotransmitters, and intracellular signaling.\\nHowever, experts note there are likely numerous genes involved in determining\\nmyopia susceptibility and that environmental factors do play a role. Overall,\\nstudies show parents who are nearsighted have a greater chance of passing\\nmyopia on to their children. The odds also increase if both parents are\\nnearsighted. The precise risk depends on the severity of parental myopia as\\nwell as environmental exposures. Ethnic patterns also demonstrate a genetic\\nlink. Asian countries, for example, have a much higher rate of myopia than\\nEuropean countries or the United States. While genetics play a key role,\\nlifestyle and environmental factors fine-tune how these predispositions\\nmanifest. But the bottom line is clear – nearsightedness has a powerful\\nhereditary component overall. Myopia Progression in Children Since myopia most\\noften develops and worsens during childhood, this is the period when genetic\\nrisk is most influential. Children with one or more myopic parents need close\\nmonitoring as their eyes continue to grow and develop refractive errors. Rapid\\nmyopia progression is especially common between ages 8-15. This is a critical\\ntime when interventions can help safeguard a child’s eyesight and offset\\ninherited risks. Implementing myopia control techniques at younger ages\\nappears to have the greatest impact on slowing progression long-term. The\\ncomplex interplay between hereditary susceptibility and environmental\\nexposures determines if and when myopia manifests and progresses in children.\\nHowever, identifying and addressing genetic predispositions early helps\\npreserve vision potential. Warning Signs of Myopia Onset in Children For\\nchildren with a family history of nearsightedness, be vigilant about the\\nfollowing signs that may indicate myopia onset: Squinting or eye-rubbing\\nDifficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading/close work Headaches\\nafter visual tasks Sitting very close to the TV Tilting head or closing one\\neye Holding objects close to face Any appearance of nearsighted symptoms\\nwarrants a comprehensive eye exam to assess the child’s status. Long-Term\\nImpacts of High Myopia In addition to blurred distance vision, high degrees of\\nnearsightedness increase vulnerability for several blinding eye diseases later\\nin adulthood. These include: Retinal detachment and tears Open-angle glaucoma\\nMyopic maculopathy Advancing myopia also further elevates the risk of vision\\nloss from these ocular conditions. Catching and controlling early myopia\\ndevelopment can therefore help preserve long-term eye health and function. By\\nunderstanding the hereditary factors at play and monitoring children’s eyes\\nproactively, the impacts of myopia on visual and ocular health can be reduced\\nover a lifetime. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Compelling\\nresearch confirms that nearsightedness (myopia) is influenced by genetic\\nfactors. And while they’re not the only factor, children with one or more\\nmyopic parents, especially at high degrees, need thorough eye exams starting\\nat an early age to determine if they are developing refractive errors\\nindicating myopia onset. Through early detection and consistent treatment, the\\nprogression of inherited myopia risks can be significantly slowed. While\\ngenetic predispositions cannot be changed, being proactive allows for\\npreserving a child’s vision and safeguarding their eye health over time.\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment\\nplans for your child.

October 26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also\\nknown as myopia, is one of the most common vision conditions affecting\\napproximately 30+% of people in the United States. In fact, it is estimated\\nthat 20-25 million children have Myopia in the United States alone. With\\nnearsightedness, objects up close are seen clearly while distant objects\\nappear blurry or out of focus. This results when the eye grows too long from\\nfront to back measured by the axial length of the eye. The elongation of the\\neyeball causes light rays to focus incorrectly on the retina resulting in\\nblurry distance vision. While nearsightedness cannot be cured, there are\\nvarious options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia\\n(nearsightedness). What Causes Nearsightedness? Nearsightedness occurs when\\nthe eyeball grows longer than normal from front to back. This causes the light\\nentering the eye to focus in front of the retina rather than directly on it.\\nThis results in blurred distance vision, while near vision remains unaffected.\\nSeveral factors contribute to the risk of developing nearsightedness, such as:\\nGenetics – Research shows nearsightedness has a hereditary component. Children\\nare more likely to be nearsighted if one or both parents have the condition\\nvs. none. Frequent near work – Activities requiring prolonged close vision\\nlike reading and screen use may encourage eyesight to adapt towards\\nnearsightedness over time. Excessive screen time – Increased use of computers,\\nsmartphones, tablets, and other screens is linked to rising myopia rates,\\nespecially in childhood. Reduced Outdoor time – Some studies indicate lack of\\noutdoor exposure, natural sunlight, and vitamin D are associated with a\\ngreater incidence of nearsightedness. Urbanization – Populations living in\\nurban versus rural areas tend to have higher rates of myopia on average.\\nEthnicity – Individuals of Asian descent have a higher prevalence of\\nnearsightedness. Many Asian countries see nearsightedness (myopia) rates of\\nover 80%. Signs and Symptoms The primary symptom of nearsightedness is blurred\\ndistance vision. When looking at distant objects like road signs, movies,\\nwhiteboards, or presentations, it can be difficult to see when nearsighted.\\nThis forces the eyes to strain and overwork to bring images into focus. As a\\nresult, individuals with uncorrected nearsightedness may experience:\\nDifficulty seeing school classroom boards Squinting or leaning forward to see\\ndistant details such as the score of a game Headaches from excessive eye\\neffort Eye fatigue after close work Poor night vision or problems driving at\\nnight Typically, both eyes are affected, though not always to the same degree.\\nThe blurry distance vision worsens gradually over time in most cases. Impacts\\nof Uncorrected Nearsightedness Allowing nearsightedness (myopia) to remain\\nuntreated can lead to several problems for your child. Myopia usually\\nprogresses over time, resulting in greater blur and dependence on treatment or\\ncorrection as you age. Constant squinting and eye effort add to fatigue and\\ndiscomfort, and unclear vision makes reading and seeing whiteboards at school\\ndifficult. There is also evidence that myopia can have social implications,\\nsuch as extracurricular activities that require distance vision become\\nchallenging. Not to mention many career options that have vision requirements.\\nHowever, all these issues don’t compare to the increased risk of severe eye\\nconditions like Glaucoma, cataracts, and the potential for retinal\\ndetachments. The severity of nearsightedness (myopia) typically stabilizes by\\nadulthood. However, getting your child’s vision treated early provides\\nsignificant benefits for eye health, visual development, and quality of life.\\nTreatment Options for Nearsightedness While nearsightedness itself cannot be\\nreversed or cured, there are effective treatment options for slowing or\\nstopping the progression of myopia. The best option will depend on the\\nseverity of nearsightedness, lifestyle needs, age, and overall eye health of\\nyour child – all of which are taken into account when getting treatment with a\\nTreehouse Eyes provider. Overnight Contact Lenses – Specially designed contact\\nlenses are designed to be worn at night only, put in right before bed, and\\ntaken out in the morning.

Essentially, your\\nchild’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the\\nrest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body\\nstops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a\\nchild’s development where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a\\nhigher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom\\nof myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches,\\neyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors\\nlead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even\\nsocioeconomic status. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all\\nover the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of\\ntheir day, whether reading a book, or using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or\\nanother device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially\\nin excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and\\nprogression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration\\nof near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating\\nnovel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a\\nmagazine a few minutes at a time. Genetics A child is more likely to be myopic\\nif one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are\\nmyopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s\\nvision checked if you or your spouse are myopic. Not Enough Outdoor Time\\nSpending at least 2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the\\nonset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play\\nevery day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! What Can You\\nDo? The good news is there are many things you can do you help slow or stop\\nthe progression of myopia. Get Regular (annual or semi-annual) Eye Exams Even\\nif both parents aren’t myopic, it’s still recommended to get an annual eye\\nexam for your child. You can schedule a myopia consultation with a Treehouse\\nEyes provider near you. Many pediatricians are able to complete basic eye\\nexams – be sure to ask them to check for myopia! Encourage Breaks from\\nExcessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids are focusing their eyes on\\nnear objects for the majority of their day. Encouraging breaks from near work\\nsuch as reading and electronic devices will help your child’s eyes and give\\nthem a chance to get back outside as it warms up. Spend More Time in Natural\\nSunlight As you encourage your child to take a break from near work, one of\\nthe best ways to enjoy that newfound time is to get outside! Natural sunlight,\\neven in the classroom, can be protective of myopia. Be sure to wear some\\nsunblock as well! If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t\\nrealize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and\\nvision.

Both\\norganizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of\\nmyopia and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the\\nprogression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life.\\nWhat is Myopia? Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, resulting in\\nblurry distance vision and increased risks of serious, sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases, such as glaucoma1, cataract2, or retinal eye diseases3. An estimated\\n1 in 3 children in the U.S. have myopia and the prevalence has grown\\ndramatically over the last 30 years4. Research has shown lack of outdoor time\\nfor kids and more near work, like reading and time on screens, drive the\\nmassive increase we are seeing in myopia5-7. Myopia Progresses As Your Child\\nGrows Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the\\nschool-age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye\\ngrows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once\\nthe rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there\\nmay be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and\\nsuddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat\\nmyopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing\\nmyopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they\\nage. Natural Sunlight Can Help Myopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time\\nspent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has\\nled to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most\\nacute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s\\npopulation will be myopic by 2050. In fact, a recent study found that\\nincreased exposure to outdoor light reduces myopia development. There Are Now\\nTreatments for Myopia There is hope for parents is there are several\\ntreatments now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia\\nin children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or\\nprescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a\\nchild’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their\\neye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good\\ncandidate for treatment. You can prevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases\\nby scheduling your child’s myopia consultation with us today.

Myopia is an eye disease that occurs when the eye grows too\\nlong—like the shape of a football. This causes distant objects to appear\\nblurry and increases the risk of serious, sight-threatening eye diseases in\\nadulthood. As a parent, you want what’s best for your child. By learning these\\n5 important facts, you may feel encouraged to do more for your child’s eye\\nhealth and long-term vision—such as ensuring that they get their eyes checked\\non a regular basis and turning to myopia management to prevent the rapid\\nprogression of this disease. The COVID-19 Pandemic Has Increased Myopia\\nPrevalence In Children The significant reduction in outdoor time during the\\npandemic combined with the surge in screen time has increased the incidence of\\nmyopia cases. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in\\nOphthalmic Research (2020), outdoor time helps slow down the change of axial\\nlength and reduce the risk of myopia. Similar results were found in a previous\\nstudy in Ophthalmology (2013) that investigated the association between myopia\\nin children and adolescents, and the amount of time spent outdoors. The study\\nanalyzed over 10,000 children and adolescents aged 20 and under and concluded\\na substantial correlation between increased time spent outside and the\\nprevalence of myopia. Each additional hour spent outside per week was linked\\nto a 2% reduction in the risk of myopia. Myopia Increases the Risk of Eye\\nDisease Those with high myopia and rapidly progressing myopia in childhood are\\nmore prone to developing ocular comorbidities or serious sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases later in life, such as: GlaucomaMacular degenerationMyopic\\nMaculopathyRetinal detachment Myopia is a Progressive Eye Disease Myopia\\nusually starts in childhood and progresses throughout a child’s school years,\\neventually stabilizing around ages 18-22. Since the eye grows in sync with the\\nrest of the body, it’s only natural that it ceases elongating in early\\nadulthood when the rest of the body stops growing. This also means that a\\nchild’s growth spurts often coincide with a higher prescription. Fortunately,\\nmyopia can be efficiently treated in order to prevent it from worsening as the\\nchild grows. Slowing myopia early in life can make a significant difference in\\nyour child’s eye health in their present and future. Myopia Is An Epidemic\\nMyopia is a global epidemic that continues to worsen, affecting close to 2\\nbillion individuals worldwide. If current trends hold, roughly half of the\\nworld’s population will be myopic by the year 2050, partly due to genetics and\\nincreasingly as a result of our society’s preference for staying indoors and\\nspending more time on digital screens. Myopia Can Be Treated Myopia cannot be\\ncured; however, its progression can be slowed or even halted. The goal of\\nmyopia treatment, also known as myopia management or myopia control, is to\\nreduce or halt the eye’s rapid growth. Effective myopia treatment entails more\\nthan simply correcting a child’s blurry vision with glasses; it’s meant to\\nprevent a child’s vision from deteriorating and, thus lowering their risk of\\ndeveloping severe myopia-related eye diseases later in life.

It alters the shape and structure of the eye limiting its\\ncapability to focus on objects in the distance (blurry distance vision). If\\nyou have struggled with the condition before, your kids might also develop the\\ndisorder at some point in life. Myopia starts with signs small signs such as\\nsquinting, sitting too close to the TV, tablet, or book, and sometimes even\\nmanifests as headaches. Besides pain and discomfort, the onset of myopia can\\nhave a ruinous impact on the quality of your kid’s life. It can be hard to\\nread the board at school or perform well in extracurricular activities.\\nTherefore, it is imperative to diagnose and prevent myopia from worsening to\\nmore sight-threatening conditions. We have hand-picked practical ways you can\\nutilize in curbing the progression of myopia in children. Let Them Spend Time\\nOutdoors The bright and ambient light outdoors is linked to the modulation of\\ncorrect eye development. Spending time outdoors can help reprogram the eye\\nstructure to focus on distant objects. You should encourage your kid to spend\\nmore time outdoors especially if he or she has already been diagnosed with\\nmyopia. Quality outdoor time helps to preserve good eyesight in addition to\\ndelaying the onset or progression of nearsightedness. Ideally, children need a\\nminimum of 90+ minutes of quality time outdoors every day. Regular Eye Checks\\nare Crucial Myopia is a very treatable condition, particularly when detected\\nearly. That is why it is crucial to take your kid for an eye test at least\\nonce a year. The disorder might show very few signs in its early stages, which\\nis why establishing baseline measurements early is paramount. Additionally,\\nsome of its signs like headache and blurry vision can easily be confused for\\nother conditions. When left untreated, myopia will gradually progress\\nincreasing the likelihood of contracting other vision disorders like cataracts\\nor detached retinas. The only reliable manner to know if your kid is at risk\\nof nearsightedness is through a clinical eye test measuring the axial length\\nof the eye. If your eye doctor is not conducting this test, they are not\\nproviding you with the best measure of your child’s eye health. Limit Screen\\nTime Excessive screen time and continuous near work are the greatest non-\\ngenetic risk factors for nearsightedness. Activities such as computer use,\\ndrawing, and reading can cause a substantial amount of strain on the eye. If\\nyour children cannot avoid these activities entirely, it is advisable to limit\\nthe time they spend on them. Taking regular breaks helps the eye to relax and\\nis ideal for managing the nearsightedness condition. Try Soft-multifocal\\nLenses for Myopia Control We are still a few months or even years away from an\\nFDA-approved eyeglass for treating myopia. By wearing our Daytime Soft Contact\\nLenses, your child no longer has to depend on glasses to have clear vision\\nduring the daytime. We understand that at times, glasses can be an\\ninconvenience for activities like sports and other vigorous activities. As\\nsuch, our contact lenses not only allow your child to see clearly but also be\\nfree from the hassle of wearing glasses. In addition, our Daytime Soft Contact\\nLenses, like all our other products, are FDA-approved, ensuring safety and\\neffectiveness. Our doctors would also follow up in subsequent consultations to\\nensure that your child is doing well and that our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses\\nare comfortable for their eyes. Go for Atropine Eye Drops Atropine eye drops\\ncan help keep the progression of nearsightedness in check by curbing eyeball\\nelongation. The chemical agent also strengthens eyeball structures to prevent\\nunwarranted eye growth that might occur in adolescent years to trigger myopia.\\nAtropine eye drops are safe when used in proper amounts. You should always\\nfollow the eye doctor’s prescription when administering the chemical for\\neffective myopia modulation. Overnight Lenses Might Help Treehouse Eyes’\\nOvernight Contact Lenses are specially designed to be worn only in the evening\\nas your child goes to bed. As such, our Overnight Contact Lenses should be\\nworn during sleep and taken out in the morning before your child prepares for\\nthe day. Specifically called KIDS Lenses, these lenses are custom-made for\\neach child to gently and comfortably reshape the cornea, which is the clear\\nfront surface of the eye. It’s incredibly important to ensure that our\\nOvernight Contact Lenses are tailored to each child as everyone’s eye shape is\\ndifferent. If the lenses do not fit a particular eye shape, the eyes may get\\ninfected by a corneal abrasion. As such, at Treehouse Eyes, each child will\\nundergo a consultation to receive his or her very own lenses that are fitted\\nto their unique eye shape. Studies have shown that myopia progression can be\\nslowed dramatically and, in some cases, stopped through this treatment in\\nchildren. Conclusion Although it is impossible to cure myopia, the condition\\ncan be treated with several clinical methods including the use of daytime soft\\nlenses. A nearsightedness (or short-sightedness) diagnosis does not mean it is\\nover for your child. Instead, you should focus on managing the conditions with\\nthe right practices to contain its progression and slow or potentially stop\\nthe disease in its tracks.

That’s why it’s a good idea to examine your everyday\\nroutine and daily habits to ensure you aren’t inadvertently doing something\\nthat could hurt your eyes. In this article, your trusted scleral optometrist\\nfrom Lumen Optometric highlights some common habits that are bad for your\\neyes. Bad Habit #1: Not giving your eyes a break. Smart phones, laptops,\\ntablets,and other digital devices with LCD screens are a staple of almost\\neveryone’s daily lives. While looking at digital screens cannot always be\\navoided, spare yourself from digital eye strain by resting your eyes after\\nevery 20 minutes of screen time. Bad Habit #2: Using contact lenses\\nimproperly. If you’ve undergone any type of lenses treatment such as neurolens\\ntherapy and need to wear special lenses, it’s critical that you follow your\\neye doctor’s instructions when it comes to handling and caring for your\\nlenses. The same goes for standard contact lenses. Bad Habit #3: Rubbing your\\neyes. This habit might be a little harder to kick. It might feel gratifying to\\nrub your eyes, but rubbing your eyes too vigorously can cause the blood\\nvessels under your eyelids to break. Try a cold compress the next time your\\neyes feel irritated. Bad Habit #4: Not eating well. A well-balanced diet is\\ncrucial to keeping your eyes healthy. Choose foods rich in vitamins C and E,\\nas well as foods containing zinc and omega-3 fatty acids. You don’t have to\\ncook elaborate meals — just make sure you load up on citrus fruits, fish and\\nleafy greens. Lumen Optometric cares about your eye health. We offer a wide\\nrange of products and services that are designed to cater to your optical\\nneeds. Call us today at (626) 921-0199 to schedule an appointment. We look\\nforward to seeing you!

The degree\\nof myopia varies and it happens to around 30% of children and teens. To remedy\\nthis, there are specific treatments called myopia control. But what exactly is\\nmyopia control? As your locally trusted scleral optometrist, we’re here to\\nhelp you understand what you need to know about myopia control. What Is Myopia\\nControl? “Myopia control” is the term to describe the methods used to prevent\\nthe progression of myopia. These measures are usually prescribed by an\\noptometrist or an ophthalmologist. They come in four primary treatments,\\nnamely: multifocal contact lenses, atropine eye drops, multifocal eyeglasses,\\nand orthokeratology. These treatments are important because they can help\\nreduce the risk of complications that lead to high myopia, such as cataracts,\\nretinal detachment, glaucoma and even blindness. Multifocal Contact Lenses\\nThese lenses are designed to provide clear vision for people who have\\nnearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and other refractive errors.\\nThese are also designed for people who are experiencing the normal age-related\\nloss of near focusing ability called presbyopia. Atropine Eye Drops This is a\\nkind of dry eye treatment that’s commonly used to reduce the pain associated\\nwith eye inflammation. It also gives relief from focusing fatigue by dilating\\nthe pupil to limit the eye’s ability to automatically change focus. Also\\ncalled accommodation, the effect it has by atropine eye drops can be counted\\nfor its effectiveness in reducing myopia progression in children. Multifocal\\nEyeglasses The eyeglasses work similarly to multifocal contact lenses, which\\nhelp wearers with presbyopia see clearly. This control treatment can also\\nmildly slow the progression of myopia in children. But some studies show that\\nthe progression slowed up to 51 percent in children compared to wearing normal\\nglasses for correction. Orthokeratology Orthokeratology, or Ortho-K, are\\nspecially designed gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight while sleeping\\nto help reshape the eye’s cornea. This slows down the progression of myopia as\\nwell as provides clearer vision during the daytime without the need for lenses\\nor glasses. Some studies found that children wearing ortho-k contact lenses\\nreduced the lengthening of the eyeball by almost 43 percent compared to\\nwearing regular eyeglasses for myopia correction. Whether you need myopia\\ncontrol or neurolens treatment, trust our team at Lumen Optometric to help you\\ndeal with your eye issues.

December 6, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Parents who are nearsighted\\noften wonder what can be done to prevent their children from developing the\\nsame or similar conditions. While scientists haven’t yet found a way to\\nguarantee that your child won’t develop myopia (often referred to as\\nnearsightedness), there are things you can do to delay its onset and even\\nprevent its progression. What is Myopia? Myopia is a progressive eye disease\\nthat causes the eye to grow longer than normal, altering its ability to\\ncorrectly focus light onto the retina. This results in blurred distance vision\\nthat can make it difficult for children to learn efficiently in the classroom\\nor take part in extracurricular activities. Myopia is often corrected with\\nprescription glasses or contact lenses, but these methods simply correct the\\nchild’s vision while allowing the condition to worsen. Why is it Important to\\nDelay or Slow Myopia Progression? The worse your child’s myopia gets, the\\nhigher their chance of developing sight-threatening diseases like glaucoma,\\nmacular degeneration and retinal detachment later in life. That’s why it’s\\nimportant to try and keep your child’s lens prescription low and controlled\\nusing the methods listed below. If your child doesn’t yet have myopia,\\nfollowing the same protocol will help prevent myopia onset for as long as\\npossible. Is it Possible To Prevent Myopia or Myopia Progression? While many\\nchildren inherit myopia from their parents, there are also several\\nenvironmental factors that can lead to the onset and progression of\\nnearsightedness. By making some lifestyle changes, it may be possible to delay\\nthe onset of myopia and prevent its progression. Boost Daily Outdoor Time\\nResearch shows that children of myopic parents who spend a lot of time\\noutdoors have lower rates of myopia than children who stay mostly indoors. A\\nrecent study published in Review of Optometry (2021) concluded that children\\nshould spend at least 2-3 hours per day engaged in outdoor activities to delay\\nthe onset of myopia, especially if a child has one myopic parent. Another\\nstudy published in Ophthalmic Research (2020) confirms the protective effect\\nof “sun time” against myopia onset. When observing the myopia rates of\\n6-12-year-olds, there were fewer new myopia cases in the group of children who\\nspent between 11-15 hours outdoors per week, compared with children who\\ndidn’t. The researchers also found that the myopia progression rate was slower\\nin the group of children who spent more time in the daylight. If you do add\\nsome extra outdoor time to your child’s daily routine, be sure to provide them\\nwith UV blocking sunglasses, sunscreen, a water bottle and other sun-safe\\ngear. Limit Screen Time Screen time is thought to have a greater impact on a\\nchild’s vision than other near work like reading a book, for a few reasons.\\nChildren are exposed to digital screens at a younger age than other forms of\\nnear work, and they tend to use screens for longer intervals of time.\\nAdditionally, the working distance between a child’s eyes and a digital screen\\ntends to be shorter than the distance between their eyes and a book or other\\nobject, to compensate for the small print size and images. An article\\npublished in Review of Myopia Management (2021) examines the results of\\nseveral scientific studies that analyze the relationship between screen time\\nand myopia. Two of these studies found that the risk of developing myopia was\\n8 times greater for children aged 5-15 who used a smartphone or video game for\\nmore than 2 hours a day, compared to children who have 0-2 hours of daily\\nscreen time. And while we don’t expect parents to ban all digital devices from\\ntheir homes, it is advisable to set daily limits on digital device usage. Try\\nto cap your child’s daily screen time at 2 hours. Children under the age of 2\\nshould have as little screen time as possible. Encourage Frequent Breaks From\\nNear Work Any sort of near work, like reading and writing, puts a strain on\\nyour child’s eyes and can contribute to myopia onset and progression. One way\\nto prevent myopia development in your child is to teach them to take breaks\\nfrom visually demanding activities. A 2008 study published in the journal of\\nInvestigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science found that the intensity of\\nnear work plays an important role in myopia development in schoolchildren.\\nAccording to the study, the duration of uninterrupted near work seems to be\\nmore significant than the overall time spent engaged in close-distance\\nactivities. Regular Myopia Eye Exams Whether or not your young child or teen\\nhas myopia, yearly eye exams with your optometrist are crucial to keeping\\ntheir vision healthy and clear. It’s important to note that vision screenings\\nin school are not enough to detect most visual problems, and certainly not for\\npreventing myopia. Tracking your child’s eyesight yearly will help determine\\nthe best treatment for preventing myopia onset and slowing or halting its\\nprogression.

While instances and awareness of\\nmyopia are on the rise, to help spread myopia awareness we’ve written out the\\nbasics on childhood myopia, why it matters, and what you as a parent can do to\\nhelp preserve your child’s eye health in the long run. What is Myopia? Myopia\\n(often referred to as nearsightedness) is the most common cause of impaired\\nvision in people under age 40, and its prevalence in children is growing at an\\nalarming rate. Myopia typically starts in childhood and progresses (the eye\\nkeeps getting bigger), or gets worse, until early adulthood. During this time\\nthe symptom of myopia, blurry distance vision, gets worse, meaning the patient\\nneeds stronger glasses to continue to see clearly. If blurry distance vision\\nis the symptom of myopia, what exactly is myopia? Stated again, myopia is an\\neye that is growing too long. How do we know this? We measure it using special\\nnon-invasive technology to calculate the length of the eye from the front\\n(cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length and\\nis measured down to fractions of a millimeter with advanced equipment. So,\\nmyopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye. Risk Factors for Myopia Myopia\\nrisk factors include genetics (having one or both parents myopic), an\\ninsufficient amount of time spent outdoors, and excessive near work (time\\nspent reading, school work, & digital screens). Childhood myopia is\\nprogressive, which is why your child may need a new prescription every year or\\ntwo. Unless treated, a child’s myopia will continue to worsen until early\\nadulthood. What some people don’t realize is that myopia is far more than\\nsimply blurred vision — it’s associated with drastically higher risk of\\ndeveloping eye disease in the future. How Can Myopia Impact a Child’s Health?\\nChildhood myopia places a child at a greater risk of developing serious eye\\ndiseases later in life, as compared to non-myopic children, and the odds only\\nincrease as myopia continues to progress. In fact, a child with myopia is 2 to\\n40 times more likely to develop myopic maculopathy (also known as myopic\\nmacular degeneration, a serious vision-threatening complication) depending on\\ntheir degree of nearsightedness. Retinal detachment is another serious eye\\ncondition that can cause permanent blindness. A myopic child is 3 to 21 times\\nmore likely to develop this emergency eye condition in adulthood. Moreover,\\nchildren with myopia have a threefold risk of developing glaucoma, a leading\\ncause of blindness worldwide, in the long run. And although cataracts are\\nconsidered a normal part of aging, having myopia advances the age at which\\nthey develop. According to a study published in JAMA Ophthalmology,\\nindividuals with high myopia are more likely to need cataract surgery at an\\nearlier age than those with no myopia. Furthermore, aside from an increased\\nrisk of adult eye disease, untreated myopia can prevent a child from\\nsucceeding academically and socially. A 2019 study published in the Community\\nEye Health Journal underscores the importance of excellent visual acuity in\\nschool-aged children. It found that offering vision correction to students\\nwith myopia has more of an educational impact than providing them with\\nvitamins or medications to maintain or improve their physical health. Myopia\\nhas equally serious ramifications outside the classroom. A study published in\\nBMC Ophthalmology (2016) found that adolescents with myopia are more likely to\\nhave anxiety than their peers with normal vision. Furthermore, adverse visual\\nsymptoms impact a child’s self-esteem, according to a study published in the\\nJournal of Optometry and Vision Science. The good news is that certain\\nlifestyle choices, especially when coupled with myopia management treatment,\\ncan have a lasting positive effect on your child’s eye health. What Can\\nParents Do To Help Slow Myopia Progression? We know that parents want what’s\\nbest for their children. So here are a few recommendations that will help keep\\nyour child’s eyes healthy — whether or not myopia has set in. Take your kids\\noutside to play. Several studies have indicated that children who spend over 2\\nhours outdoors during the day have lower levels of myopia and slower myopia\\nprogression. A recent study published in BMC Ophthalmology and cited in Review\\nof Optometry (2021) found that for non-myopic children with myopic parents, “a\\nhigh level of outdoor exposure had a remarkable influence on the risk of new\\nmyopia for children even with one myopic parent.” Although it’s not always\\neasy, try to limit the amount of continuous near work your child does. Whether\\nit’s reading or scrolling through a phone, remind your child to take breaks.\\nHowever, the most important thing you can do to protect your child’s long-term\\neye health is manage their myopia with treatment. We Can Help Preserve Your\\nChild’s Eye Health At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to provide expert care to\\neach and every child with kindness and a smile. Our state-of-the-art equipment\\nand diagnostic technology enable us to thoroughly assess your child’s visual\\ncondition and needs.

However, many children have undiagnosed vision issues that require early\\ndetection and intervention for the best outcomes. Why Early Detection Matters\\nCatching vision problems early in childhood is crucial. Early detection\\nensures children get the vision correction they need during critical\\ndevelopmental windows. Those children suffering from vision deficits can lead\\nto academic issues, behavioral problems, and even low self-esteem issues.\\nSigns Your Child May Need an Eye Exam There are several signs parents should\\nlook for that may indicate a child is struggling with their vision: Frequent\\nsquinting or rubbing of the eyes Sitting very close to the TV or holding\\ndevices close to the face Tilting the head to one side Covering one eye\\nDifficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading/close work Losing place\\nwhile reading Trouble differentiating colors Clumsiness or poor hand-eye\\ncoordination Headaches or eye pain after visual tasks If you observe any of\\nthese symptoms, schedule an eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist\\nwho specializes in pediatric patients. An exam can identify issues like\\nnearsightedness, farsightedness, lazy eye, convergence problems, and other\\ndisorders. Protecting Your Child’s Vision Health Along with regular eye exams,\\nthere are several ways parents can help maintain healthy eyesight: Ensure your\\nchild wears 100% UV-blocking sunglasses outside Limit screen time and take\\nfrequent breaks from ‘near-work’ Provide a nutritious diet with eye-healthy\\nvitamins Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure Following your eye\\ndoctor’s specialized treatment plan is also essential to managing any vision\\nconditions your child is diagnosed with. The Benefits of Annual Eye Exams\\nGetting your child’s eyes checked every year is a critical piece of preventive\\nhealthcare. At annual exams, optometrists and ophthalmologists thoroughly\\nevaluate vision acuity, eye alignment, and eye health. Treehouse Eyes\\noptometrists go a step further by measuring axial length to determine if\\nmyopia is present or not. This allows early detection of refractive errors\\nlike myopia (nearsightedness) as well as other eye disorders like amblyopia or\\nstrabismus, which require prompt treatment. Catching and addressing issues\\nearly improves outcomes and treats the issues rather than just correcting them\\nwith glasses. Annual exams also screen for eye diseases and conditions that\\nrarely show apparent symptoms in kids, like glaucoma. Preventing and\\ncontrolling these disorders protects long-term vision. Treehouse Eyes is proud\\nto join in Children’s Eye Health and Safety Month by helping educate families\\nabout protecting one of their child’s most precious gifts—the ability to see\\nthe world clearly. By scheduling comprehensive eye exams each year and\\nremaining vigilant for signs of vision issues, parents can ensure their\\nchild’s visual development stays on track. If you have any concerns about your\\nchild’s vision, consult a Treehouse Eyes doctor near you. Healthy eyes and\\nclear sight in childhood provide a lifetime of benefits. Let Treehouse Eyes\\nHelp Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to\\ndevelop personalized treatment plans for your child.

August 28, 2023 by Lumen Optometric The Complex\\nRelationship Between Eye Growth and Myopia Development The human eye is a\\nremarkably dynamic organ that undergoes natural growth and changes over a\\nlifetime. One key factor that significantly impacts eye development is myopia,\\nalso known as nearsightedness. Myopia occurs when the eyeball elongates (grows\\ntoo long) from front to back, causing light rays to focus incorrectly and\\ndistant objects to appear blurry. This eye growth is driven by a combination\\nof genetic and environmental factors. Research shows myopia is becoming more\\nprevalent globally, affecting around 30% of the world’s population, with an\\nestimated 50% by the year 2050. Theories for this increase include frequent\\nnear-work on digital devices/homework and less time outdoors early in life.\\nBoth can strain the visual system and put the eyes at risk for abnormal\\nelongation. When myopia develops, the implications go beyond the need for\\nvision correction. Excessive eye growth is linked to a higher risk of blinding\\nconditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment later in life.\\nMyopia also reduces the quality of life, at school, when playing sports,\\nparticipating in extracurriculars, and activities requiring distance vision\\nlike driving. So what proactive steps can be taken to support healthy eye\\ndevelopment and reduce the odds of myopia onset? The most important step you\\ncan take is to get your child a yearly eye exam. This ensures that their\\nvision is being monitored and tracked in case of issues like myopia. Below are\\na few other tips to help support your child’s eye health. Increase time\\noutdoors, especially in early childhood. Avoid chronic use of screens/mobile\\ndevices at young ages Maintain clear focus on distant objects through\\nactivities like sports Get regular eye exams to monitor for signs of abnormal\\ngrowth Eat a nutritious diet and nutrients that may support ocular health\\nUnderstand your genetic predispositions and family history The key is taking\\npreventive actions early. Though myopia itself cannot be reversed once\\nmanifested, slowing or even stopping the progression is possible. Implementing\\nhealthy lifestyle habits and frequent eye assessments allows for early\\nintervention against excessive eye growth in children. So… do your eyes grow?\\nYes. Just like all other parts of the body, your eyes grow as well. Where\\nissues occur is when the eyeball grows too long from front to back (a.k.a.\\nMyopia), resulting in blurred distance vision.

Myopia Symptoms and How To Treat December 2,\\n2022 by Lumen Optometric Treehouse Eyes is a specialty pediatric eye care\\npractice treating myopic children with a nationwide network of doctors.\\nRecently, doctors in our Treehouse Eyes community had the chance to spread the\\nword about myopia with local media coverage. Our doctors are passionate about\\nspreading awareness about the myopia epidemic and how early intervention can\\nmean a lot for your child’s eye health. Explore some of the topics our peers\\ncovered in recent interviews. How To Tell If Your Child Is Nearsighted It’s\\nnot always simple to detect whether or not your child is nearsighted. Watching\\nout for the common symptoms of myopia is key to determine whether or not your\\nchild needs treatment. Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Aimee Jacobs OD, discusses\\nsome signs to look out for. Dr. Jacobs explains, “If they’re having trouble\\nfocusing in school, if they can’t stay on task, if it seems like it might be a\\nbehavior issue, a lot of times it’s because they can’t see what they’re doing\\nor they can’t see what they’re doing well enough to focus on it.” Screen Time\\nAs a Risk Factor As screen time increases, so does the early onset of myopia.\\nTreehouse Eyes has observed a 30 percent increase in the number of myopic\\nchildren being treated since the pandemic began. Dr. Tiffany Martinez recalls\\nthe effects of the pandemic on children, “During the pandemic we saw a lot\\nmore kids they we saw become myopic than we did before.” This is due to the\\ndecreased time outdoors and increase in near work. Another Treehouse Eyes\\npartner, Dr. Ryan Stybel describes the effects of too much ‘near work’,\\n“Screen time or near work is causing myopia to start at an earlier age but\\nalso progress more rapidly.” He then goes on to explain the implications of\\nCOVID isolation, “We’re just getting through a pandemic, myopia is an epidemic\\nespecially with the increased screen time and virtual learning. Limiting\\nscreen time is a very important thing and taking frequent breaks and spending\\ntime outdoors. We recommend 90 minutes a day outdoors to use the natural\\nsunlight and looking at distance objects can be beneficial and help their eyes\\nfrom getting worse.” What To Look For As a Parent: Myopia is a treatable and\\npreventable disease, annual eye exams are highly recommended because often\\ntimes children are unable to articulate their symptoms to a parent. Dr. Denise\\nSmith, a Treehouse Eyes doctor featured on KVUE-TV in Austin, Texas provides\\nsome tips on how to detect myopia, “Parents can be looking for if the child is\\nsquinting, if they can’t see the board at school they might be complaining of\\nheadaches, or holding books closer to their face holding their phone closer,\\nmaybe getting closer to the television.” So why is it essential to go through\\nmyopia management and treatment rather than just getting glasses? Dr. Smith\\nexplains why myopia treatment is critical, “If the child is diagnosed with\\nmyopia, just getting glasses can help them see clearly, but will not do\\nanything to stop the progression or prevent the eyeball from getting longer.\\nSo you want to be able to have those specialized treatments to actually stop\\nthat process which in turn can prevent sight threatening disorders later on.”\\nLet Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia Treating myopia early is\\ncrucial to prevent children’s vision from getting worse. Our mission is to\\ngive children better vision for life so children can have a life advantage to\\nbeing able to participate in more activities.

April 10, 2023 by Lumen Optometric What Is Myopia?\\nMyopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a common vision problem that will\\naffect half the world’s population by 2050. It occurs when the eye is unable\\nto focus on distant objects without corrective lenses like glasses or\\ncontacts. Myopia is caused by a variety of factors, including genetic and\\nenvironmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. Is Myopia Genetic? If\\nyou’re thinking about myopia, knowing if it’s genetic is essential. If you\\nhappen to be myopic, then your kids might be at risk of developing the same\\ncondition. Myopia has two types: genetic and non-genetic (or “acquired”).\\nGenetic myopia is passed down through families and tends to run in certain\\nclusters or patterns. Non-genetic means that individuals develop their vision\\nissues without any family history or a genetic predisposition toward poor\\nvision. In general, suppose both parents have healthy eyesight but have\\nchildren with poor vision (without any other eye problems). It’s likely that\\nthose kids were born with a form of genetic myopia known as Axial Myopia (AM).\\nAbout half of all cases fall into this category! Why Does Myopia Get Worse\\nwith Age? When you find out your child is first diagnosed with myopia, it is\\nessential to intervene as early as possible. Myopia progresses when a child’s\\neye grows too long from front to back, causing permanent and irreversible eye\\ngrowth, known as axial elongation (the measure of the eye from front to back).\\nWhen a Treehouse Eyes doctor finds a low level of myopia (nearsightedness),\\nit’s easier to treat with a wider range of treatment options. In short, myopia\\nchanges as we age due to axial length elongation that occurs during childhood.\\nThe longer the eyeball gets, it’s associated with serious eye conditions that\\ncan lead to permanent vision loss such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, and\\ncataracts. This is why it is imperative to treat myopia as early as possible\\nand start getting your child’s eye examined annually to catch any changes in\\ntheir vision. How to Stop Myopia from Getting Worse with Age To prevent myopia\\nfrom getting worse with age, it’s important to get your child regular eye\\nexams and see the treatment options for myopia such as custom contact lenses\\nor prescription eye drops. If you’re concerned about your eyesight, it’s\\nalways a good idea to schedule an appointment with a Treehouse Eyes\\noptometrist. Conclusion Myopia is a common vision problem that affects\\nmillions of people worldwide. It is caused by a variety of factors, including\\ngenetics and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. The key to\\nproperly treating myopia and preventing it from worsening is by catching it\\nearly, typically in childhood. By following the tips mentioned above, you can\\nhelp prevent myopia from getting worse and maintain good eye health.

There is some\\ndebate about whether myopia is a disease or a refractive error. The answer is\\nuncovered by how myopia is defined and measured. What Is The Definition Of A\\nDisease? The Review of Myopia Management provides a few definitions of disease\\nto consider: A disease is any harmful deviation from the normal structural or\\nfunctional state of an organism, generally associated with certain signs and\\nsymptoms and differing in nature from physical injury. (Encyclopedia\\nBritannica, 2020) A disease is an abnormal condition affecting a living\\norganism. Diseases are generally understood to be medical conditions that\\ninvolve a pathological process associated with a specific set of symptoms.\\n(Infectious Disease News, 2019) Myopia, also called nearsightedness or\\nshortsightness, is the inability to see objects at a distance and is the most\\ncommon vision issue amongst children and adults. Myopia’s main symptom is\\nblurry distance vision; however, the physiological implications of myopia is\\nthat the eyeball itself grows too long from front to back, see figure 1 below.\\nIs Myopia Curable? The question of whether or not myopia is curable helps\\nillustrate why myopia is a disease. Treehouse Eyes doctor, Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D.\\naddresses the common question, “Can myopia be cured?” Myopia is not curable,\\nbut it can be treated. “Unfortunately, once myopia happens, which happens due\\nto the eyeball growing too long, it is impossible to shrink it afterwards.\\nWhen myopia occurs, it is permanent and irreversible.” Dr. Mai then goes on to\\nexplain the importance of early intervention, “We can prevent high levels of\\nmyopia which are associated with diseases such as macular maculopathy and\\nretinal detachment. Starting treatment early is critical because there is no\\ncure for myopia and once a child is diagnosed with this disease, it typically\\ngets worse if left untreated.” Myopia is a disease that can be treated at the\\nsource by providing children with treatment options, rather than just giving a\\nchild glasses for the symptom of myopia which is blurry vision. Myopia Is a\\nDisease Although myopia has symptoms like blurry vision, that aren’t caused by\\nphysical injury, myopia itself is caused by the eye growing too long. In other\\nwords, the axial length increases outside of the normal rate for a child’s\\nage. See Figure 2 below. Image Source The elongation of the eye is the core\\nissue. Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. details, “The greater the myopia, the longer the\\naxial length of the eye and thus greater risk. Myopia is clearly a disease.\\nOne that requires treatment to reduce the negative impact it can have on a\\nperson’s eye health and vision.” Myopia is a significant, prevalent disease in\\nchildren with increasing rates of progression. There are also two types of\\nclassifications: non-pathologic and pathologic myopia.

The goal of this procedure is to reduce\\nmyopia or nearsightedness of patients. To know more about Ortho-K and what to\\nexpect, here is a list of frequently asked questions. 1\\\\. “Are there age\\nrestrictions for Ortho-K?” None. Children as young as six years old have been\\ntreated with Ortho-K lenses. In fact, the treatment is one of the most common\\nmethods of vision correction in pre-teens and teens. 2\\\\. “Who is considered a\\ngood candidate?” Ortho-K proves to be an effective treatment for farsighted,\\nnearsighted and astigmatic patients. If your child has been unable to wear\\ncontact lenses, due to discomfort or allergies, they make a good candidate.\\nThis is because Ortho-K lenses are easy to use and can be worn while sleeping.\\n3\\\\. “How do Ortho-K lenses differ from typical lenses?” Ortho-K contact lenses\\nare specifically designed with highly oxygen-permeable material. The back\\nsurface of the lens is particularly made to enable the reshaping of the\\ncorneal tissue. 4\\\\. “How long does it take to reach good vision?” Stable\\nvision can be achieved after 10-14 days of treatment, depending on the\\nprescription. In fact, 50-70% of the desired visual correction is attained\\nafter the first night of wear. 5\\\\. “How long can Ortho-K provide myopia\\ncontrol?” The effect of myopia control should last as long as your use of\\nOrtho-K lenses. It is advisable for young children to wear the lenses until\\ntheir late teens when myopia tends to destabilize. Fortunately, there are no\\nanecdotal reports from patients that state ‘rebounding’ after their use of\\northo-K contact lenses has come to an end. To get started with Ortho-K\\ntreatment, it is essential to contact a trusted eye exam doctor.

This is especially true with\\nthe pandemic upheaving our lives and forcing us to stay home for virtual\\nlearning or work from home. The consequences are not just limited to\\nheightened obesity rates. Studies have shown that having less sunlight could\\nactually change the ways that a child’s eyes develop, resulting in a myopia\\nepidemic that rises in tandem with the obesity crisis. You need to encourage\\nyour child to spend more time outdoors to protect their eyesight and prevent\\nmyopia. Downsides of Spending Time Indoors According to a recent Australian\\nstudy, kids who spend only about 20 minutes per day outdoors experience\\nquicker growth in the length of their eyes than those who log more hours in\\nbright eyes. This can result in myopia and trouble seeing faraway objects.\\nThankfully, there are some ways available that you can still use to keep an\\neye on your child’s eyesight. They are listed as follows. Not Enough Outdoor\\nTime Spending at least 2-3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent\\nthe onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to\\nplay every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Encourage\\nOutdoor Time Our eyes need an optimal amount of bright light that can be\\ngotten from outdoors. Therefore, by aiming for around 40 minutes of outdoor\\ntime daily, not only can your children get the physical activity that they\\nneed that day, but it can also be beneficial to their eyes and help to prevent\\nthe onset of myopia. Look out for Warning Signs It is important to look out\\nfor warning signs that your child might have myopia so that they can get\\ntreated for it early. Children suffering from myopia may squint, constantly\\nfeel the need to rub their eyes or complain of consistent headaches, they may\\nalso start having trouble with their academic grades. If your child\\nexperiences any of these symptoms, it is important to schedule an appointment\\nwith an optometrist. Schedule Regular Screenings To help prevent or manage\\nmyopia, it is important to have regular eye screenings for your child. Doctors\\nrecommend yearly vision screenings either by your child’s pediatrician or\\ntheir school as well as a vision screen at well-child visits through age 4.\\nNewborn babies should also have their vision tested before they leave the\\nhospital, and before your child hits the age of 5, it is important to take\\nthem to a pediatric ophthalmologist for a thorough checkup if they are\\nsuffering from any vision concerns or have a family history of vision\\nconcerns. If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is\\nthat myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision.\\nHaving myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing\\nserious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment,\\ncataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia\\ncan be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease. You can\\nprevent serious, sight-robbing eye diseases by scheduling your child’s myopia\\nconsultation with us today.

But how much do you really know about this progressive eye disease?\\nSome parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is\\nthe only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much\\nmore to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll\\nexplore 4 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about\\nyour child’s eye health and long-term vision. Myopia is an Eye Disease Myopia\\nis an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be\\nfocused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is\\nelongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading\\nobjects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is\\nround like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. As this\\nhappens, the symptoms of the disease are blurry distance vision. Because the\\neye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops\\nelongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This\\nalso means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience\\ngrowth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in\\ntheir myopia. To help combat this, we recommend eye exams every six months to\\ntrack myopia progress. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye\\ndisease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people\\nworldwide. We are currently on pace to have half of the world’s population\\nwith some degree of myopia by the year 2050! Indoor time, excessive ‘near\\nwork’, and genetic factors all play a role in the growth of myopia. Education\\nFor Their Future Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses\\nthroughout the school-age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens.\\nBecause the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops\\nelongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This\\nalso means there may be times in a child’s development when they experience\\ngrowth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to\\neffectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child\\ngrows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye\\nhealth as they age. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease\\nMyopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight-threatening eye\\ndiseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration,\\nand retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50%\\nhigher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop\\ncataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults\\nthan children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of\\nclear vision — a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in\\nthe Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided\\ntheir children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic\\nmaculopathy fell by 40%.

Essentially, your child’s eye\\nis growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the\\nbody, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing\\nin early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s\\ndevelopment where they experience growth spurts—suddenly requiring a higher\\nprescription due to an increase in their myopia. It can affect both children\\nand adults, with over 50% of American teenagers being myopic according to this\\njournal. Here are some ways to recognize the signs and symptoms of myopia in\\nchildren. Consistent Headaches Headaches can be a common system of vision\\nproblems, it is important to track how often your child is experiencing\\nsymptoms of headaches. Some headaches may be a result of allergy symptoms or\\npressure changes, but they could also be a direct result of nearsightedness.\\nIf your child is experiencing more than one headache per week, do schedule an\\nappointment with an optometrist or pediatrician to try and get your vision\\nchecked for myopia. Excessive Eye-Watering Excessive eye-watering can also be\\na symptom of myopia, given that it can result in discomfort in the eyes. If\\nyour child experiences consistent and excessive eye-watering, do schedule an\\nappointment with an optometrist to get your vision checked. Excessive\\nSquinting If your child is squinting excessively, it might also be a symptom\\nof myopia. This is due to the fact that humans suffering from myopia squint as\\na result in changes in the tension of their eye muscles, providing them with\\nbrief clarity of vision. Thereby, it should be easy to spot individual\\nsuffering from nearsightedness if he or she engages in excessive squinting.\\nHolding Objects Close to Their Face Another glaring symptom to look for if\\nwondering is if your child constantly holds objects closer to their face to\\nsee them properly. This is a clear symptom of nearsightedness which may be\\ncaused by excessive usage of screen time. Consistent Rubbing Of Eyes When\\ndealing with a young child that might potentially have myopia, they might\\noften rub their eyes as a sign of discomfort. If you notice that your child\\nexcessively and consistently rubs their eyes, it might be a sign to schedule a\\nconsultation with the optometrist to have their vision assessed. Sitting Very\\nClose to the TV You might find your child sitting too close to the TV than\\nthey normally do. The most apparent sign that your child may have myopia,\\nespecially for older kids, is if they grumble about the images on the TV\\nscreen looking unclear or blurry, or if they tell you they have issues reading\\nthe words shown on screens.

In today’s article, your\\ntrusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric shares some simple eye health\\ntips for young adults. Take a Break When Using Digital Devices Young adults\\ntend to spend a lot of time on their digital devices. Unfortunately, staring\\nat a computer or phone screen for too long can make the eyes feel dry and\\ntired, eventually causing blurred vision. This is because people tend to blink\\nless when staring at a digital screen. To avoid digital eye strain, you need\\nto give your eyes frequent breaks. You can do this by following the 20-20-20\\nrule: after 20 minutes of screen time, look at an object 20 feet away for 20\\nseconds to give your eyes a break. Practice Good Contact Lens Hygiene If you\\nwear contact lenses, it’s critical to observe proper hygiene to avoid eye\\ninfections. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses and keep water away from your\\ncontacts. Use fresh contact lens disinfecting solution every time. Always wash\\nyour hands with soap and water and then dry them with a clean cloth before\\ntouching your contact lenses. Most importantly, follow your eye doctor’s\\nrecommendations about replacing your contact lenses. Don’t wear a pair of\\ncontact lenses beyond their scheduled replacement date. Lead a Healthy\\nLifestyle The three most important things you can do to safeguard your vision\\nare maintaining a healthy diet, exercising often and avoiding smoking. Leading\\na healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing eye diseases like age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and diabetic retinopathy.\\nYou should also practice good sleeping habits. Lack of sleep can adversely\\naffect your health in many ways. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of eye\\ncare services including orthokeratology therapy, neurolens therapy and more.\\nWe use the latest research and technology to give our local patients the very\\nbest treatments.

In our technologically driven\\nworld, conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism are becoming\\nincreasingly prevalent among children. This article will unpack these\\nconditions, helping you understand what they are, how they differ, and most\\nimportantly, what you can do to manage and treat them. The Differences Between\\nMyopia and Astigmatism Myopia results when your eye grows too long from front\\nto back, causing light to focus before it reaches the retina. If a normal eye\\nis shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye may more closely resemble a\\nfootball. In contrast, astigmatism is usually due to an irregularly shaped\\ncornea or lens. Myopia primarily affects distance vision, while astigmatism\\naffects vision at all distances. Both conditions can coexist in one eye, and\\nthey often do. This combination can further complicate vision, making it\\ncrucial to address both issues. Combining Science and a Child-Centric Approach\\nAt Treehouse Eyes®, we combine robust, science-backed data with inspiring\\naesthetics for both children and parents alike. We’ve created an environment\\nthat children love, helping to alleviate the fear sometimes associated with\\nmedical appointments. Our team of experts provides thorough eye examinations\\nusing the latest technology, identifying refractive errors and other eye\\nhealth issues early. We then create a personalized treatment plan that suits\\nthe needs and lifestyle of your child. Myopia and astigmatism are common eye\\nconditions that can affect children of all ages. If your child has been\\ndiagnosed with either of these conditions, it’s important to seek early\\ntreatment to protect their vision and prevent further complications. Managing\\nMyopia and Astigmatism with Treehouse Eyes® So, how can you protect your\\nchild’s vision if they’re diagnosed with myopia or astigmatism? Treehouse\\nEyes® is the first and only dedicated myopia management service provider in\\nthe United States.

If this is the case, you may feel relieved about this, but does\\nit really mean you have perfect vision? To answer this, we’ll first explain\\nthe related vision terminology to help you understand how we measure your\\nvision’s quality. Visual Acuity Visual acuity is the term used to express the\\nclarity or sharpness of your vision. This is measured by your ability to\\nidentify the letters or numbers on a standardized eye chart while standing at\\na certain distance. So, for instance, if you have 20/20 vision, you can see\\nclearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance. Similarly,\\nif you have 20/100 vision, it must mean that you can see as close as 20 feet\\nto see what those with 20/20 vision normally see at 100 feet. 20/20 vision\\ndoesn’t always mean your eyesight is perfect. For instance, if you’re getting\\nnearsighted, we may recommend that you use our orthokeratology lenses to slow\\nits progression. But then this only indicates how sharp and clear your vision\\nis at a distance. There are also other vision skills that are just as\\nimportant, such as eye coordination, side vision, focusing ability, color\\nvision, and depth perception. The Snellen visual acuity system is named after\\nthe Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, who developed the system in 1862.\\nThe system uses acuity measurements in fractions of 20/20, 20/40, 20/60, and\\nso on. The numerator or the top number of the Snellen fraction is the distance\\nbetween the eye chart and the patient. In the U.S., the viewing distance is\\nusually 20 feet while in other countries, it’s 6 meters. Meanwhile, the bottom\\nnumber of the fraction corresponds to the visual acuity of the patient. Higher\\nnumbers mean less clarity and sharpness in eyesight. For instance, the Big “E”\\nthat you see in most Snellen eye charts corresponds to 20/200 visual acuity.\\nIf this is the only letter you can discern, then there’s a chance that you may\\nbe legally blind unless prescribed with corrective contact lenses. The Factors\\nand Limits The major factors that determine visual acuity are as follows: 1\\\\.\\nThe accuracy of how the lens and cornea of the eye focuses light onto the\\nretina 2\\\\. The sensitivity of the nerves in the retina and vision centers in\\nthe brain 3\\\\. The ability of the brain to interpret information received from\\nthe eyes Visual acuity tests are quite useful in measuring the clarity of your\\neyesight in standardized conditions, it’s not completely accurate in\\ndetermining the overall quality of your vision. Some of its limitations are\\nthat it can’t measure how well you see colored objects, moving objects, or\\nobjects that are similar in brightness to their background.

This is a result of the eye growing too long from front to\\nback leading to blurry vision when looking at faraway objects. On the other\\nhand, hyperopia, or farsightedness, is the opposite. Distant objects are\\nclear, but those up close appear blurry. This condition occurs when the eye is\\ntoo short from front to back, or the cornea is too flat, leading to light\\nfocusing behind the retina. Diagnosis and Differences The diagnosis of both\\nconditions involves scheduling a routine eye exam – especially one trained to\\nspot myopia like the doctors at Treehouse Eyes. These exams include visual\\nacuity tests, refraction assessments, and eye health evaluations. Be sure that\\nyour eyecare provider is measuring your child’s axial length to ensure an\\naccurate diagnosis of myopia. Axial length will measure how long the eye is\\nfront to back. Notably, the critical difference between myopia and hyperopia\\nlies in their distinct symptoms and the way they affect vision. People with\\nmyopia often have difficulty viewing road signs, and whiteboards, or watching\\na movie at a cinema or at home. In contrast, those with hyperopia may struggle\\nwith tasks like reading, using a smartphone, doing homework, and other times\\nwhere closer vision is necessary. Treatment Modalities Fortunately, both\\nmyopia and hyperopia are manageable with several treatment options. The key\\nfor both, but especially myopia, is early detection and treatment. Myopia is a\\ndisease that typically develops in children (ages 6 – 12) and continues\\nthrough puberty until the child stops growing. This can sometimes be well into\\nadulthood (25 years old in some cases) which is why early treatment and\\nprevention are key to slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. For\\nchildren, orthokeratology, or Ortho-K, is a potential treatment. It involves\\nthe use of specially designed gas-permeable contact lenses that temporarily\\nreshape the cornea to help treat your childs myopia. Recent studies suggest\\nthat certain types of multifocal contact lenses may slow the progression of\\nmyopia in children. Furthermore, low-dose atropine eye drops have shown\\npromising results in minimizing the advancement of myopia. Conclusion\\nUnderstanding the differences between myopia and hyperopia is vital in\\nrecognizing the need for a timely eye exam and appropriate treatment. Through\\nmodern optometry, children are now able to receive the treatment and care they\\nneed to improve their vision and quality of life. Remember, regular eye\\nexaminations are critical to detect any visual impairments at an early stage.\\nIf your child is experiencing any changes in their vision, contact your local\\nTreehouse Eyes doctor. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia\\nTreehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment\\nplans for your child. Our treatment plans include special prescription eye\\ndrops and customized daytime and overnight contact lenses.

Still, it\\ncan also bring a host of changes to your vision. As the hormones in your body\\nchange and fluctuate during this period, you may experience various eye-\\nrelated issues that can affect how clearly you see or make your eyes\\nuncomfortable It’s good to be aware of these common changes and take steps to\\nprotect your vision throughout pregnancy. Common Vision Changes During\\nPregnancy Here’s what you can expect: Dry Eyes – Many women experience dry\\neyes during pregnancy due to hormonal fluctuations. It usually happens around\\nmid-pregnancy when hormone levels are at their highest point and decreases\\nafter delivery as hormone levels return to normal. Blurry Vision – During\\npregnancy, it is not uncommon for women’s eyesight to become blurry or cloudy\\ndue to their changing hormones. It should resolve itself once their hormone\\nlevels return to normal after childbirth. Light Sensitivity – Some pregnant\\nwomen find themselves more sensitive than usual when exposed to bright lights,\\nsuch as sunlight or fluorescent lighting in stores or office buildings, which\\ncan cause discomfort. Floaters – Small spots may appear in front of one’s\\nfield of vision, known as floaters. These tend to increase with age but may\\ntemporarily worsen during pregnancy because many people become dehydrated\\nwhile expecting a baby. Glaucoma – Women with a family history of glaucoma are\\nat higher risk for developing it during the later stages of their pregnancies,\\nso regular checkups with an optometrist will help ensure that any potential\\nproblems are caught early on before causing further damage. Eye Health During\\nPregnancy Here are some tips for protecting vision during pregnancy: Eat\\nplenty of fruits and vegetables high in vitamins A and C. Drink plenty of\\nfluids, like water, every day. Wear sunglasses outdoors if needed. Get regular\\ncheckups from an optometrist throughout all trimesters. Rest often and get\\nadequate sleep each night. Manage stress by taking breaks from work,\\nexercising regularly, etc. Why You Should Get Checked If pregnant women fail\\nto protect their vision, they risk serious complications such as premature\\nbirth, miscarriage and gestational diabetes. Regular optometrist visits are\\nessential to catch any potential problems before they become more severe.\\nLumen Optometric in Sierra Madre, CA, is dedicated to providing comprehensive\\neye care for all stages of life.

Below\\nis a short summary of our COVID-19 protocols: Our Flow: ● We are a specialty-\\nlens practice with a focus on education, quality materials, and patient\\nexperience. Our exams slots have always allowed for 45-50 mins for each\\npatient, with 15 mins of buffer time between patients. Our historic scheduling\\npractices align well with COVID prevention measures. ● Our doors will be\\nlocked, but we’re open! Just knock or call us at (626) 921-0199 Negative\\nPressure Exam Rooms (Updated 7.27.2020) ● Our exam rooms are set up as\\nnegative pressure rooms, meaning that the air in those rooms is being pulled\\nup and out into the environment. The goal is to ensure that patients aren’t\\nbeing brought into rooms with stagnant, stale air. To create your own negative\\npressure system for your home or office, follow the guide Dr. To created here\\nand be sure to download the template for this specific Honeywell HEPA filter.\\nLumen Negative Pressure Template Social Distancing ● Patients can conveniently\\nbook an appointment online or through email/call/texts. We require all of our\\npatients to fill out their forms ahead of time and submit them through our\\nsecure online portal. Any other required documents can be uploaded to our\\nportal or emailed/texted to us. This helps minimize touchpoints and allows the\\npatient’s examination to begin immediately upon arrival. ● Curbside pickup\\nwill be available for glasses. ● All contact lenses will be shipped directly\\nto patients’ homes/workplaces. ● We will only take patients by appointment-\\nonly to ensure that we are prepared for each anticipated patient. When a\\npatient arrives, before they are allowed entry, we will perform a wellness\\nscreening, touchless temperature check, and provide hand sanitizer. We will\\nrequire that masks be worn throughout their entire visit. ● Our office layout\\nhas been restructured to maximize social distancing of our staff and patients.\\nYour Lumen experience will span across four different rooms, with no more than\\n20 minutes spent in each room to allow for maximal air-cleaning and\\ndisinfection. ● Patients will only be allowed to bring a guest if they are (1)\\na minor or (2) need physical or translation assistance. Disinfection/Cleaning\\n– Updated 9.20.20 ● When you arrive, you can be sure that our office has been\\nthoroughly disinfected. ● We utilize a combination of chemical disinfection,\\nUVC disinfection, ozone disinfection, and HEPA-filtration. This will not only\\ntake care of our surfaces, but will take care of anything lingering in the\\nair. ● For every square foot of patient care areas, we have THREE times the\\namount of HEPA filtration. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – Updated\\n8.2.20 ● Our staff will be wearing masks throughout the day in addition to\\nface shields, depending on the required task. ● Staff meetings performed at\\nopening and mid-day will consist of wellness screenings, temperature checks,\\nand a review of our patient list of needs/requirements to make sure we’re\\noperating in a safe, efficient manner. ● Acrylic barriers will be in place in\\nareas where face-to-face communication is unavoidable. ● Our staff will be\\ntaking daily inhaled doses of Iota-carrageenan, which is a polymer derived\\nfrom red seaweed that has demonstrated inhibitory activity against\\ncoronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.

As the only\\nneurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley, Lumen Optometric\\ncustomizes state-of-the-art lenses that bring clarity and comfort to patients\\nsuffering from migraines, neck strain, tired eyes and more. Our goal is to\\nhelp your eyes and head feel less tortured at the end of the day, so if you\\nsuffer from any of the following symptoms, Lumen Optometric can help: > How\\nNeurolens Therapy Works Your brain is constantly in communication with your\\ntwo eyes, keeping them aligned and in sync to help you see the world without\\ndouble vision. If your eyes are misaligned, however, your brain struggles to\\nmaintain balance. Without this balance, you could experience constant\\nheadaches, migraines, tension in and around your eyes, dizziness and even neck\\nstiffness. Add misalignment to the strenuous demands that computer screens,\\nphones and other digital devices place on your visual system, and you could\\nface daily suffering. Fortunately, 10 years of research into headaches and\\ntheir associated visual symptoms has yielded the revolutionary neurolens\\ntreatment. Neurolens therapy helps correct misalignment at the distance where\\nyou need the most help. Whether you struggle to see far away or up close,\\nLumen Optometric can provide customized neurolenses that correct your specific\\nmisalignment and give you the most comfortable vision possible. Lumen\\nOptometric is proud to offer this exciting new technology and we’d love to\\nhelp you discover relief for your symptoms! Check out the following video for\\na neurolens overview, and then read on for answers to some of the FAQs we\\nreceive. Neurolens FAQ What makes this any different than the glasses I wore\\nin the past? The difference is in the technology and the visual experience.\\nNeurolenses utilize patented, clinically tested technology to correct your\\nmisalignment at your prescribed working distance. There is no lens on the\\nmarket that offers the same technology. And Lumen Optometric keeps several\\nsets of neurolens prescriptions on hand, so if you are a candidate for a\\nneurolens treatment, you’ll have the opportunity to see and feel the neurolens\\ndifference at the end of your exam! How do you measure my misalignment? Lumen\\nOptometric utilizes a sophisticated instrument called the SightSync to measure\\nyour eye misalignment at varying distances. Coupled with specialized in-office\\ntesting, your eye measurements allow us to create a lens that helps with your\\nspecific symptoms. How quickly can I expect my symptoms to improve? Most Lumen\\nOptometric patients notice an improvement within the week, although patients\\nwith extremely chronic conditions may require six to eight weeks to notice an\\nimprovement. Are there any side effects to the neurolenses? First-time\\nneurolens wearers typically report feeling lighter, as if there’s less burden\\non their heads, necks, shoulders and eyes. But, as with any new type of lens,\\nyou may feel disoriented for about a week as your brain adapts. Schedule an\\nEvaluation Today If you work on the computer for a good chunk of the day,\\nsuffer from migraines or experience dry eyes, let Lumen Optometric put relief\\nin sight. We’re the only eye clinic in the San Gabriel Valley to offer\\nneurolens treatment technology. In fact, we’re only the sixtieth clinic in the\\nworld to offer the neurolens!

It’s possible with\\nOrthokeratology (Ortho-K) from Lumen Optometric. Ortho-K is an FDA-approved,\\nnon-surgical treatment that corrects your vision by gently reshaping your eyes\\nwhile you sleep. In the morning, you simply remove your custom Ortho-K lenses\\nand experience clear vision all day! ORTHOKERATOLOGY FOR ADULTS: One of the\\nbiggest breakthroughs in correcting your myopia (aka nearsightedness) or\\nhyperopia (aka farsightedness) is a process called Orthokeratology, or\\nOrtho-K, for short. It is a revolutionary system that accomplishes three\\nthings-it corrects your vision while you sleep, removes the need for daytime\\ndistance glasses/contacts, and allows you to avoid dryness, irritation, or\\nallergies with traditional contacts. HOW IT KEEPS YOUR EYES HEALTHY: Relative\\nto wearing soft contacts, which are worn for a period of 12-18 hours a day,\\nOrtho-K lenses are only worn while you sleep, so the overall wear-time is much\\nless. Additionally, these lenses are only worn under clean conditions (you’re\\nat home!) so there’s much less of a chance of allergies and virus/bacterial\\ndeposits. HOW IT GIVES YOU CLEAR VISION: You wear a special retainer-like lens\\nto sleep and upon waking, you remove the lenses. When the lenses are off, you\\nwill be able to see clearly for the rest of the day. Glasses or traditional\\ncontacts will never have to be worn again for the distance so long as you wear\\nyour Ortho-K lenses to bed every night. Depending on your needs for reading,\\nOrtho-K can be modified to enhance your reading vision, but reading glasses\\nmight still be needed depending on your age and intensity of your near-work.\\nWHAT ELSE MAKES ORTHO-K UNIQUE? Ortho-K is only worn while in the comfort and\\ncleanliness of your own home so you will never have to worry about\\nlosing/breaking/tearing glasses/contacts while at work or participating in\\nsports. It is a great option for farsighted patients who are having trouble\\nadapting to wearing glasses. Additionally, it is also a wonderful option for\\nathletes, outdoor enthusiasts, or patients with dry eyes or severe allergies\\nwho can no longer tolerate soft contact lenses.

There are no age requirements. I HAVE\\nMYOPIA (aka NEARSIGHTEDNESS) WHAT IT MEANS: You were prescribed glasses for\\nthe distance (driving, TV, anything greater than a couple feet away). At a\\ncertain prescription, you see better up close without your glasses/contacts.\\nHOW ORTHO-K CAN HELP: You won’t need to put on glasses to see in the distance\\nany longer! *For those of you who are myopic but need reading help with\\nprogressive lenses, Ortho-K can also be built with a reading enhancement to\\naid with reading. I HAVE ASTIGMATISM IT’S COMPLICATED: Astigmatism can occur\\nwith both myopia and hyperopia WHAT IT MEANS: You see slightly distortion and\\nshadows without your glasses, which you might wear for both distance and near.\\nHOW ORTHO-K CAN HELP: You won’t experience the distortion nor shadows! I HAVE\\nHYPEROPIA (AKA FARSIGHTEDNESS) Farsightedness is more complicated, it breaks\\ndown into two categories (simplified for this web format) CATEGORY 1: You’re\\nfarsighted and only have trouble with reading. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has\\nbeen fairly clear for your whole life, but upon landing in your 40-50s, you\\nfind that you now need reading glasses. HOW ORTHO-K CAN HELP: You won’t need\\nreading glasses for most tasks and your distance will likely subtly improve.\\nCATEGORY 2: You’re farsighted and have trouble with both reading and the\\ndistance. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has been clear up until your 30-40s, but now\\nyou need glasses for both distance and near. HOW ORTHO-K CAN HELP: This\\nscenario is the most life-changing for patients! Ortho-k essentially reverses\\nyour visual experience by about 20 years, back to a time when you were able to\\nwake up seeing 100% clear. Other eye health factors need to be taken into\\naccount before initiating Orthokeratology. During an Ortho-K consult, one of\\nour doctors will review your complete visual and systemic health to ensure\\nyou’re a good candidate.

Candidacy Our Technology\\nFrequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens\\nExams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID-19 Protocols Videos About Us\\nOffice Testimonials Blog Frequently Asked Questions / Orthokeratology /\\nFrequently Asked Questions Below are the top ten most frequently asked\\nquestions. We have a longer list that can be emailed as well. I just have to\\nsleep in these lenses to see clearly? Yes, the lenses gently mold your eyes\\nwhile you sleep. As long as you sleep in the lenses for a continuous 6-8\\nhours, your vision will reach full, waking-hour clarity within a 1-2 week time\\nframe. So what do I wear in the meantime in those first 1-2 weeks? During your\\ntransition period and depending on the size/type of your prescription, you\\nwill be given soft contacts or loaner glasses to ease the transition. What can\\nI expect during the first 1-2 weeks? Your vision will become clearer day by\\nday, and the clarity will last longer and longer with each passing day. But\\nduring the first couple of weeks, your vision will go from clear to your\\noriginal level of blurriness by the day’s end. The period of blurriness\\ndecreases with each day until full clarity is reached. How does the lens feel?\\nThe lens is made with a more rigid material, so initially it’s more noticeable\\nand requires a little more adaptation. The good news is that since the lenses\\nare inserted right before bedtime, most of the adaptation takes place while\\nyou sleep! How long does the Ortho-K effect last after the initial transition\\nperiod? The vision-correcting effect is programmed to last for ~24 hours, but\\nsome patients can experience clear vision for 36 hours without having to\\nrewear the lens. How long your vision remains clear after 24 hours depends on\\nthe size of your prescription. Is vision clear while I’m wearing the Ortho-k\\nlenses? Yes, vision is very clear with the lenses on. They are designed not\\nonly to mold the cornea, but to also give you clear vision if you have to wake\\nup in the middle of the night (for the restroom, emergency evacuations, etc).\\nWhat happens if I miss a night? Patients with lower prescriptions don’t notice\\nan obvious difference the next day, but patients with higher prescriptions\\nwill notice blurriness in the distance. Computer tasks for patients are\\ndefinitely workable if you miss a night, but night driving is not recommended.\\nSoft contacts can be given to you to make up for any residual blur. What\\nhappens if I decide to stop Ortho-K? Your vision returns to normal over 2-3\\nweeks, sometimes faster. Are there any side-effects to Ortho-K? Glare is the\\nprimary side effect, which occurs with any refractive procedure such as\\nLASIK/PRK/SMILE/etc as well. Glare tends to be more noticeable in the initial\\nadaptation period, which lasts 1-2 months. After that period, the brain learns\\nto adapt and filter out residual glare. I thought it was unhealthy to sleep in\\ncontacts? Patients are told not to sleep in traditional contacts because\\nthey’re worn throughout the day, throughout sleep, and again in the daytime\\nfor a minimum of at least 30 hours of wear time. Additionally,\\ndebris/germs/mucus accumulate on traditional lenses, which your eye is then\\nexposed to for the 30+ hours of wear. With Ortho-K, you only wear them for a\\nperiod of 7-8 hours maximum while under clean, home conditions.

Ortho-K works by gently reshaping\\nthe front surface of the eye (the cornea) while you sleep. The retainer lenses\\nare inserted right before bedtime and removed after waking. Because the lenses\\nare designed to correct your vision overnight, you will wake up with vision\\nthat will remain clear throughout your waking hours. The lenses are then re-\\nworn nightly to maintain clear vision. Recent advances in technology have\\nallowed us to design Ortho-K lenses that are created 100% from the shape of\\nyour eye. The custom nature of the lens allows for a healthier fitment.\\nAdditionally, custom lenses work more quickly and will allow you to reach a\\nclear endpoint in a shorter time period To learn about the safety profile of\\nOrtho-K, continue reading here.

Medmont is\\nhailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300”\\nbeing the gold standard topographer for over a decade. Their newest\\ntopographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more\\naccurately capturing your cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical\\naccuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your eye, which\\nyields faster, healthier, and clearer outcomes. WAVE CUSTOM LENS DESIGN Lumen\\nOptometric is the only office in Los Angeles County that employs WAVE to\\ncreate 100% fully-custom lenses for your eyes. WAVE combines all the\\ntopographical (corneal shape) data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to\\nspecify and manipulate every aspect of your lens design. Custom design\\nsoftware is extremely critical for both clarity and eye health because each\\npoint of the lens is based on information from your cornea. Tip for inquiring\\npatients – If you are told that you’re being fitted with custom lenses, ask to\\nsee your design. It should look similar to the screenshot above. If a doctor\\ntouts that they’re fitting a custom lens but is unable to show you a\\nscreenshot like the above where they can manipulate every aspect of every\\ncurve, they’re not designing a custom lens. All doctors will refer to their\\nlenses as custom, but it is actually quite rare because of the difficult\\ntraining, complicated CAD software, and cutting-edge equipment that is\\nrequired.

Scleral lenses are specialty, custom-molded lenses that\\nbring clear and comfortable vision to patients with corneal issues such as\\nkeratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, or post-LASIK complications. If\\nyour vision and comfort are lacking because of these complications, don’t\\nsettle. Sclerals represent the gold standard keratoconus treatment that is\\nnon-surgical. Dr. Eric To is the only practice-owning optometrist in Los\\nAngeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society.\\nWe’d love for you to experience effortless vision, so reach out and let Lumen\\nOptometric restore clarity and comfort to your vision. Scleral FAQs As a\\nleading scleral optometrist, Lumen Optometric has the information you need. To\\ngive our valued patients more detailed insight about scleral lenses, we’ve\\ncompiled a convenient list of FAQs. What are scleral lenses? Scleral lenses\\nare large-diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (the\\nclear window of the eye) and gently rest on the sclera (the white, outer layer\\nof the eye). The rigid nature of the lenses makes your vision extremely crisp.\\nScleral lenses should not be confused with traditional gas permeable (GP)\\nlenses. Traditional GP lenses are small lenses made of durable plastic that\\nsit on the extremely sensitive cornea. Conversely, scleral lenses tend to be\\nmuch more comfortable because they settle on the less-sensitive sclera. Who is\\na candidate for scleral lenses? Many patients can benefit from scleral lenses,\\nespecially those suffering from: Keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration\\nHigher prescriptions & visual needs that aren’t met by glasses or soft\\ncontacts Dry eyes, with or without soft contacts Glare/distortion after LASIK,\\nPRK or corneal transplants Exacting visual demands from things like sports,\\nvideography & photography Will I see a difference between scleral lenses and\\nsoft contact lenses? Scleral lens prescriptions offer greater vision and\\ncomfort than soft contact lenses because: Scleral lenses are built from highly\\ncustomizable materials that offer the clearest, most stable vision correction.\\nScleral lenses sit on the less-sensitive part of the eye and are inherently\\nmore stable. Scleral lenses offer options that make them more customizable for\\nfull distance clarity or for improved reading vision. Do all eye doctors fit\\nscleral lenses? Not all eye doctors fit scleral lenses, but Lumen Optometric\\nspecializes in advanced scleral fitting! Our talented scleral optometrist uses\\nan sMap3D instrument to capture a full 3D representation of your frontal eye.\\nThat custom scan helps us build a Scleral 2.0 lens that accurately fits your\\neye. Lumen Optometric is the only provider in the San Gabriel Valley to offer\\nthis state-of-the-art technology, and we liken the process to creating a 100%\\ncustom-made suit. Like a tailor designing a suit based on every measurement of\\nyour body, Lumen Optometric creates a scleral lens that is more accurate and a\\nhealthier fit for your eyes. What is a Scleral 2.0 lens? Traditional sclerals,\\nor scleral 1.0 lenses, have been used for roughly a decade. The newer, more\\ntechnologically advanced Scleral 2.0 lenses are customized specifically for\\nyour eye. So while creating a Scleral 2.0 lens is comparable to designing a\\ncustom-made suit, fitting scleral 1.0 lenses is similar to modifying an off-\\nthe-rack suit: you select a suit size that approximates your body shape and\\nmake a limited number of adjustments to help the suit drape over your body’s\\ncontours. Our mission at Lumen Optometric is to aim for a flawless fit with\\nyour scleral lenses, not a best-guess approximation. Check out these videos to\\nsee what a difference customized scleral lenses can make! What’s it like to be\\nfit with Scleral 2.0 lenses? An advanced scleral lens fitting starts with both\\ncorneal and scleral topography. A corneal topographer maps the cornea, the\\nclear window of the eye. Scleral topography is a separate, dedicated\\ninstrument that can scan the elevation changes of your eye’s white surface.\\nThis painless procedure does not require dilation drops, but it does require\\nthe use of a temporary dye that enhances our scans. We then place a calibrated\\n“test” scleral lens on your eye. That test lens gives you an opportunity to\\ntry out a scleral lens and gives us time to fine-tune your prescription. Once\\nyour prescription data is obtained, it’s combined with the shape data to\\ncreate your fully customized scleral lens. Please note that during a scleral\\nlens consultation, we take all necessary measurements of your eye. Be prepared\\nto set aside 60 minutes of eye doctor time to ensure that the measurements are\\ncorrect. What is the best keratoconus treatment for me? Or if I have pellucid\\nmarginal degeneration or any other condition where the cornea is no longer\\nconsistent in its shape (post-LASIK/RK/corneal transplant), how will sclerals\\nhelp me? Sclerals are the best keratoconus treatment available, they’re the\\ngold standard! They will give you clear, distortion-free vision. Think of an\\nirregular cornea as the warped windshield of a car. That warping distorts what\\nyou see through the windshield, leading to extreme glare in addition to\\ndistorted vision. When you fill a custom scleral lens with conditioning\\nsolution and apply it to your eye, the solution “mates” the scleral with your\\ncornea to give you a new, smooth, regular surface to see through. This\\nperfectly contoured surface cancels out your distortion and blur, leaving you\\nwith clear and comfortable vision. The outcomes are the same for keratoconus,\\npellucid, or any other type of corneal irregularity. If I’m already wearing\\nglasses or contacts and I see acceptably, will scleral lenses make a\\ndifference? That depends on how you define acceptable. Most people are fairly\\nadaptable to the options they’re given, so until you’re shown a difference,\\nyou may not be aware that the potential for improvement exists. For example,\\nif you’ve been wearing the same set of contacts for nearly a decade, there’s a\\ngood chance you’re missing out on clearer, healthier and more comfortable\\ntechnology. Lumen Optometric can keep you up-to-date on the best and\\nhealthiest options for your only set of eyes. The impact of scleral lenses\\nalso depends on your prescription. If you have an extremely minimal\\nprescription, scleral lenses will be more helpful in correcting dry eyes or\\nperformance-based vision. If you have a moderate or high prescription with\\nastigmatism, the benefit of sclerals will be vision that’s clearer and more\\nstable. Visual stability is something many of us take for granted until we are\\nshown what true stability looks like. For example, consider the fluidity of\\nthe newer 120hz televisions relative to their older 60hz counterparts. 60hz\\ntelevisions looked normal to us until the 120hz upgrades were released. When\\npatients have high levels of astigmatism, scleral lenses provide results\\nsimilar to that of seeing an image on a brand new, high-definition television\\nfor the first time! Corneal health is another factor to consider. If you have\\nany corneal issues, scleral lenses will significantly impact your vision and\\nimprove your quality of life. If my eyes are dry, how can sclerals help me?\\nWhen you apply a scleral lens to your eye, the “bowl” of the lens is filled\\nwith sterile conditioning solution. This conditioning solution is held against\\nyour eye for as long as you wear the lens, creating a moisture chamber that\\nhelps alleviate your dry eye. Of course, scleral lenses represent only one\\ntreatment modality within a greater dry eye treatment system. Severely chronic\\ndry eye patients may need additional treatments to overcome their dryness\\nsymptoms, and Lumen Optometric has several dry eye treatment plans available.\\nSchedule an Appointment Today Lumen Optometric combines the latest technology\\nwith advanced training to provide the clearest and healthiest vision for our\\npatients.

Researchers believe that the\\nenvironment kids grow up in today, with too many close distance activities\\n(like reading and device use) and lack of outdoor play, is contributing to the\\nrapid increase in childhood myopia. While glasses and contact lenses\\ncompensate for a child’s blurry vision, they don’t stop your child’s vision\\nfrom continuing to deteriorate. As children grow, myopia often develops as\\nthey reach school age and progresses into their late teens or early twenties.\\nThe Dangers of Myopia Researchers now know there is more to worry about with\\nmyopic eyes than the inconvenience of ever-thickening lenses. Scientific\\nevidence has proven that myopic patients are more vulnerable to a range of\\nsight-threatening diseases and complications. In fact, myopia is the sixth\\nleading cause of blindness. Patients with mild myopia have a four-fold\\nincrease in the risk of retinal detachment. For those with moderate to severe\\nmyopia, the risk increases ten times. One study concluded that more than 50\\npercent of retinal detachments not related to trauma are associated with\\nmyopia. Other myopia risks include glaucoma, cataracts, and macular\\ndegeneration. Myopia Can Be Managed The dangers of myopia, in conjunction with\\nthe normal challenges of subpar vision, mean it is important for parents of\\nmyopic children to manage the condition as part of your child’s eye health.\\nThe goal of myopia management is to slow the progression of myopia and reduce\\nits impact on your child’s life. The younger myopia management begins, the\\nmore effective the treatment. We are excited at Lumen Optometric to announce\\nthe launch of our children’s myopia management service in partnership with\\nTreehouse Eyes®, the country’s leading myopia management service. The\\nrevolutionary system, designed to treat your child’s myopia and significantly\\nreduce the threat of more serious eye diseases, is one of the most important\\ninnovations since glasses were first prescribed hundreds of years ago!

SO WHY DID THE SCREEN MOVE\\nFURTHER BACK WITH MYOPIC PATIENTS? This is due to the whole eye growing longer\\nin depth, which occurs in myopic patients. This front-to-back elongation moves\\nthe retina (the screen) beyond the point where the cornea (the projector)\\nexpects to concentrate its light to a focus. SO WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? When\\nthe outer shell of the eye (the sclera) elongates, it forces all the internal\\ncomponents that line the inside of the eye (the retina) to also stretch. There\\nare two problems with an enlarged eye and a stretched retina: Problem #1 – A\\nnuisance Your child has to wear stronger glasses/contacts every time their\\nprescription increases. They become dependent on glasses/contacts from the\\nmoment their eyes open in the morning to when their eyes close for bedtime.\\nProblem #2 – A health concern The stretched retina is thinned and weakened,\\nwhich leads to a higher risk of blinding eye diseases, such as myopic\\nmaculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts.

Multifocal Contact Lenses\\nMultifocal contact lenses are a very specific type of soft contact lens that\\nhas been demonstrated to slow progression as a myopia treatment.

The bad news: there is a clear connection between\\nparents passing their nearsighted genes to their children. The good news: your\\ngenetics are not entirely to blame! Even though myopic inheritance has been\\nestablished, the steep rise in myopia over the past 50-60 years cannot be due\\nto inheritance alone. In the graph above, you will notice that in the 1940s,\\nthe prevalence of myopia in this select group of East Asian university\\nstudents was 10% to 37%. If you fast forward to the present, the prevalence is\\nstaggering; it is over 80% to 90%! It is impossible for such a sudden shift to\\nhave occurred in the gene pool of those nations—so the cause cannot be\\ngenetics alone. In looking for the cause of this progression, researchers\\nstudied the visual demands of those university students. It was demonstrated\\nthat the average student in Shanghai was responsible for 15 hours of homework\\nper week, compared to 6 hours per week in the United States. Even though the\\nprevailing thought that excessive close work leads to more myopia, they found\\nsomething else more interesting. They found that it was the lack of outdoor\\ntime that led to an earlier and more rapid nearsighted progression! One thing\\nthat is clear based on the epidemiological studies, and it is that genetics\\nalone cannot account for this explosive myopic epidemic. ARE ELECTRONIC\\nDEVICES HARMING MY CHILD’S EYES? The answer is a complicated “yes.” The logic\\nof excessive screen time worsening vision is sound, but there has been no\\nconclusive evidence that screen time alone contributes to myopic progression.\\nWhat is known is that with every moment our children are spending time indoors\\nwith their eyes glued to screens, they are not spending those moments\\noutdoors. This is where science has stepped in to find a strong correlation\\nbetween outdoor playtime and the slowed or delayed onset of myopia. Children\\nwho spend a couple of hours outdoors every day have been found to be four\\ntimes less likely to become myopic. Our stance when it comes to screen time is\\nboth scientifically-driven and rooted in common sense. Being outdoors provides\\nthe healthy sunlight our eyes and skin need. It’s also fantastic for both\\nphysical and visual development. Being less sedentary and more active outdoors\\nenforces better hand-eye coordination, depth perception, and eye coordination\\nskills. All efforts should be made to reduce screen time when possible for\\nthese reasons. Click here to learn about the treatments available to slow or\\nstop the progression of your child’s myopia.

Zeiss IOLMaster Optical Biometer An optical biometer is\\ntraditionally used by surgeons to perform power calculations for lenses that\\nare to be implanted in the eye. We utilize optical biometry for a different\\nreason: to measure the length of your child’s eye, which is referred to as\\naxial length. As your child grows, their eyes grow as well. Our goal is early\\ndetection and differentiation between natural growth of the eye versus\\naccelerated myopic progression. Since a longer eye leads to a stretched retina\\n(which has its own complications as seen in the “Is Myopia Unhealthy” page),\\nit’s critical that we know the rate at which your child’s eyes are growing.\\nPreviously, the only known method to monitor the eye’s growth was through the\\nprescription, but each prescription does not correlate with a specific eye\\nlength. Typically, prescription changes lag axial length changes, which means\\nthat if you only monitor through prescription, chances are that you will miss\\nlength changes that may have already occurred. Treehouse Eyes affiliates such\\nas our office are one of the few offices in all of Los Angeles County that\\nemploy technology solely to measure axial length for children. Medmont Meridia\\nCorneal Topographer A leading-edge topographer is critical to monitor how the\\ncornea (the clear window of the eye) changes over time with myopia treatments.\\nMedmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model\\n“E300” being the gold standard topographer for a decade. Their newest\\ntopographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more\\naccurately capturing your child’s cornea in three dimensions. Increased\\ntopographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your\\nchild’s eye, which yields faster and better outcomes. Medmont partnered with\\nLumen Optometric to help launch the new gold standard and we’re proud to be\\nable to offer this latest form of technology to our patients. WAVE Custom Lens\\nDesign Lumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles county that employs\\nWAVE to create 100% fully-custom lenses for your child. WAVE combines all the\\ntopographical data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and\\nmanipulate every aspect of your child’s lens design. From a doctor’s\\nperspective, the customizable nature of WAVE allows for (1) maximum myopia\\nmanagement, (2) more accurate vision correction, (3) increasing the level of\\nmyopia protection in a lens. For patients, it simply means their eyes are more\\nprotected from myopic progression, they see better and arrive at a clear\\nendpoint in less time. Aren’t All Myopia Management Lenses Custom? Depending\\non the type of lens a practitioner may be limited to (either due to technology\\nor training), their definition of custom will differ. This is an overview of\\nthe three different types of “custom” lenses you will encounter as a\\npatient/parent. Basic custom – These types of ortho-k lenses are similar to\\noff-the-rack suits in that they come in a predefined size. Depending on your\\nneeds, the suit is then upsized or downsized to another predefined size.\\n“Basic custom” ortho-k lenses exist in certain parameters and different lenses\\nare selected based on visual estimation. Due to the lack of true\\npersonalization, your child can share the same lens design as another patient.\\nSemi-custom – This category of ortho-k lenses begins to incorporate technology\\nsuch as topography in the design of the lens. Lens design software will use\\nthe topographical data to generate a lens off of an pre-established template.\\nTo return to the suit analogy, measurements are taken for a suit to be made,\\nbut the suits still have certain non-modifiable assumptions made about the\\nproportions. And if a suit has to be modified, you still operate within those\\nnon-modifiable template assumptions. Fully-custom – WAVE lenses are all fully-\\ncustom designs. WAVE lenses incorporate topographical data of the eye which\\ncan then be fully-manipulated by a Certified WAVE Designer (CWD). Every aspect\\nof the lens can be changed relative to one another, leading to the most form-\\nfitting and visually effective lens. We utilize WAVE lenses because our\\npatients see the best out of them! Tip – If a doctor can’t show you the visual\\nlayout of your child’s lens design with numerical readouts of those design\\nelements, it’s likely not a fully-custom lens. If you point to any one aspect\\nof the design and ask for it to be changed in real time for demonstration, yet\\nit can’t, it’s likely not a fully-custom lens. Lastly, fully-custom lenses are\\nall doctor-designed from start to finish, meaning that the lenses are all\\ndesigned in-house by the same doctor taking care of your child. Basic or semi-\\ncustom lens designers outsource their change requests to lens consultants.\\nFully-custom lenses require more training to design and troubleshoot, in\\naddition to requiring very specific hardware. We only fit fully-custom lenses\\nbecause they are the healthiest option for your child.

WHAT IS MYOPIA & WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT PROGRESSES?\\nWhen your child is myopic (which leads to nearsightedness), it means that\\ndistant objects are blurrier than near objects. To understand why this occurs,\\nlet’s first consider how a perfect eye works. Consider when conditions are\\nperfect: When light passes through the clear, front window of the eye\\n(cornea), it is focused on the inner lining of the eye (retina). Here’s an\\nanalogy (Figure 1): think of the cornea as a movie projector, with the retina\\nas a projector screen. The projector and the screen are 20 feet apart, and the\\nprojector casts its image 20 feet away onto the screen. The result is a clear\\nimage. Consider when the conditions are imperfect: A nearsighted eye is\\nlonger, which causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly\\non it, leading to a blurry image (Figure 2). Imagine the projector casting an\\nimage 20 feet away, but with the projector screen now sitting 25 feet away,\\nwhich leads to a blurry, out-of-focus picture.

Candidacy Our Technology Frequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens Exams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID 19 Protocols Videos About Us Office Testimonials Blog 3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked Blog AMD Awareness Month 3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked3 Big AMD Myths, Debunked February 3, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Age related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in adults aged 50 and older. Given its complexity, it’s essential to understand the facts about the condition rather than believing the common myths often shared online or by friends and family. Knowing more about AMD can help you take steps to prevent or delay its progression, so here are statements you can overlook to maintain your vision for years to come. Myth #1: AMD Is a Disease That Only Affects Older Adults AMD is an eye condition caused by deterioration in part of the retina, called the macula. This area at the back of your eye helps you see things with sharp detail and color when looking straight ahead for example, when reading or driving a car but it does not affect peripheral vision like looking out into the distance around you. While researchers are still working to understand what causes this macular degeneration, it’s likely due to age combined with other risk factors such as smoking, obesity and genetics. Who is at risk of AMD? People over age 50 have an increased risk of developing early stages of this condition; however, younger people may also be diagnosed if they have certain genetic mutations associated with these conditions. Myth #2: There Is No Cure for AMD Though there currently isn’t a cure for late stage AMD, treatments are available depending on which type has been diagnosed. Dry AMD has no treatment yet, but recent studies indicate that some dietary changes may slow its progression. Lifestyle changes that can help include eating leafy green vegetables rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, as well as omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oil might reduce inflammation throughout your body, including within your eyes. Similarly, maintaining good overall health by exercising regularly, eating healthy foods, quitting smoking and protecting yourself from UV light will help lower ocular inflammation. Myth #3 All Vision Loss From MDM Is Irreversible Treatments such as intravitreal injections of anti vascular endothelial growth factor medications and photodynamic therapy can help improve vision in some cases. Other treatments such as laser therapy, vitrectomy, cataract surgery and low vision aids can also help reduce AMD’s effects. Early diagnosis and management are key to preserving your sight longer with AMD. Time to Get Checked If you are over 50 or have any other risk factors for developing AMD, you should get an eye exam with your doctor. If you live in the Sierra Madre area, Lumen Optometric can provide comprehensive eye exams to help detect AMD early and offer recommendations for treatment and management. We also provide other ophthalmologic services and products, such as contact lenses and orthokeratology. Call us today at to schedule an appointment.

There is NO scientific evidence to support the claims that contact lens wear is unhealthy during these times. For the vast majority of contact lens wearers, their contact lenses are inserted and removed at home, with no manipulation throughout the day.

That’s why millions of people wear these lenses for several hours on a daily basis. However, despite being a common device used to correct vision, it’s not unusual for some contact lens wearers to forget a thing or two about contact lens safety. Generally, contact lenses are safe when they are worn responsibly and cared for properly. Whether you are new to wearing contacts or you have been a long time contact lens wearer, make sure that you follow these 10 important rules listed by neurons treatment expert Lumen Optometric. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses. Closing your eyes while wearing your lenses reduces oxygen and makes the surface of your eye more vulnerable to infection.Don’t wear your contacts when you are in the shower, swimming pool, ocean, or hot tub. Tap water, seawater, and the water from lakes, rivers, and pools harbor organisms that can cause an eye infection.Have your contact lenses fitted by a qualified eye care professional. And make sure to follow their instruction on when to replace your contacts. Using lenses for longer than the manufacturer’s recommendation will increase your risk for eye infection as protein buildup could occur. If you are also using dry eye treatment, ask your doctor about precautions on wearing contacts, if any.Always use fresh contact lens solutions every time you store your contact lenses in their case. Never reuse solution or top off old solution since the disinfecting ability of the old solution is already gone.Never use saline water for disinfecting or cleaning your contact lenses. Saline solution is just sterile saltwater, so it has no ability to clean or disinfect contacts.Wash your hands with soap and water before touching your contact lenses. Make sure to completely rinse and dry your hands.Clean your contact lens case using a multipurpose contact lens solution. Let it dry during the day and make sure to replace it every month.Check your contact lenses for tears or chips. Although these lenses are soft, a tear or a chip can still scratch your eye. It’s best to discard your lenses if they have been damaged.Discard your lenses if they land on the floor or in the sink.If you are using reusable lenses, make sure to rub the lenses with a multipurpose contact lens solution. This will help remove debris or protein buildup. Lumen Optometric Need to consult a scleral optometrist? Visit Lumen Optometric to get excellent and personalized eye care services.

The obvious benefits of fresh air and physical exercise aren’t the only perks for kids who play outdoors. Recent research shows that increased “sun time” can actually slow down the progression of myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), or even postpone its onset! But First, What Is Myopia and Why Is It Harmful? Myopia is an eye disease that causes the eye to elongate more than it should, resulting in blurry distance vision. It’s caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, two of which are not spending enough time outdoors and doing excessive near work like device use. Many parents aren’t aware that childhood myopia significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration later in life. It’s been shown that higher myopia is associated with a greater risk of eye disease. That’s why it’s important to stop myopia in its tracks with myopia management. 3 Reasons Why Outdoor Play Benefits Your Child’s Eyes Whether your child is currently nearsighted or not, spending time outdoors in the sunshine can help delay the onset of myopia or slow its progression. 1\\\\. The Brightness of the Sun The sun’s visible light is significantly brighter than the lighting in almost any indoor setting, which may play a major role in controlling myopia. Studies have shown that when sunlight comes in contact with the retina, it causes the release of dopamine into the eye. This may prevent the eye from elongating. Preventing the eye from growing too long is the main goal of myopia management. What is certain: children who spend at least 2 3 hours playing outdoors in the sunshine progress less rapidly than children who spend almost all their time indoors. 2\\\\. Long Distance Focusing It is well established that prolonged near activities like reading and screen time contribute to myopia onset and progression. It’s no surprise that studies now show COVID 19 confinement may have caused higher rates of myopia in children as well. Spending time outdoors, on the other hand, encourages your child to focus on distant objects like trees, basketball hoops, a ball flying through the air anything that’s more than an arm’s length away. 3\\\\. Vitamin D Vitamin D helps smooth muscle tissue around the eye’s crystalline lens allowing it to function properly. This smooth muscle helps focus light on the retina, and may also help maintain the proper eye shape and length between the lens and the retina, which can become distorted as a child’s eyes grow with every passing year. Moreover, the sun’s invisible UVB light triggers Vitamin D production. Some studies have found that nearsighted individuals have lower levels of Vitamin D than those with normal vision. However, more research is needed to solidify this claim, as only small scale studies have been performed. The recommended time for daily outdoor play is at least 2 hours for children over the age of 6. Be sure to send your child outside with a water bottle, sun hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.

The more you know about workplace eye safety, the better you can protect your eyes and the longer you can enjoy clearer and healthier vision. Lumen Optometric, the area’s leading specialist in corneal reshaping and other eye care services, shares some of the things you can do to protect your eyes in the workplace. 1\\\\. Wear the necessary eye protection. Those whose career is in construction work, engineering and landscaping tend to be more at risk of eye related injuries. If you belong to any of these fields, make sure that you always wear the applicable eye protection. Doing so not only keeps you safe but also ensures you’ll be able to carry out your tasks in a more efficient manner. 2\\\\. Reduce exposure to blue light. People working in construction, engineering, and other physically demanding jobs run the risk of developing eye problems, but this doesn’t mean those working in the office aren’t exempt. Staring in front of a computer screen can make office employees more prone to digital eye strain. Its symptoms may include headaches, fatigue, dry and watery eyes, and blurred vision. If you’re experiencing these yourself, schedule a consultation with a premier eye exam doctor like Lumen Optometric promptly. You can also take steps to lower your eyes’ exposure to blue light. Using an anti glare screen on your computer can help. You may also adjust screen brightness or position the monitor in such a way that it’s not directly facing a bright light source. 3\\\\. Follow the 20 20 20 rule. For every 20 minutes of screentime, take a 20 second break and look at an object 20 feet away. You don’t even need to stay seated as you do this. How about taking a quick stroll around the workplace to give your eyes a much needed rest?

By limiting your child’s screen time, you help your child to experience the many benefits. As a parent, you should be mindful of how much time your child spends on devices. You might be wondering, how can a parent help in preventing eye diseases in their children? Well, it all starts with limiting screen time. Here are several ways for you to do just that. Set Expectations The first step to limiting your child’s screen time is to let them know what you expect. Set clear expectations early on, explaining why you are limiting their screen time and why it’s important for them to spend more time playing outside or reading books. If they have concerns or questions about limiting their screen time, listen and address them before setting the limit so that they understand why it is important to follow these rules. You can even make a deal with your child: if they spend 30 minutes doing something other than using screens, then they can watch TV or play video games for 30 minutes afterward (or whatever works best). However, don’t give in to demands be consistent! Set a Timer Setting a timer is an effective way to limit your child’s screen time. Not only will it remind them when their allotted time is up, but it can also help them keep track of how much time they’ve spent on various activities as well. You can choose from several apps that are available for download onto your smartphone; or if you prefer, there are physical timers out there as well (like ones with bells). If using an app, simply select the length of time that you want your child to spend looking at screens and set the alarm accordingly. Once this is done, you can set up notifications to alert you every hour so that if anything goes wrong or if any inappropriate material is being viewed you’ll know about it right away. Create a “Tech Free” Zone in Your Home You can create a “tech free” zone in your home by choosing a room or space that is free of all screens and then putting them there. This could be your child’s bedroom, or it could be a quiet spot in the house where you can enjoy each other’s company without distractions. This will allow everyone to relax and disconnect from technology while they’re at home, which may help prevent screen time overload and overstimulation when using technology later on. Lead by Example The most effective way to control your child’s screen time is by monitoring your own usage as well. While it is important to set limits for your child, you need to be aware of how much time you are spending in front of a screen as well. Children will often mimic their parents, so if you want them to cut back on their own screen time, then it’s best for parents to do the same thing first. Choose Treehouse Eyes For Better Vision It’s important for your child to develop social skills and human interaction. You can’t do this if they’re glued to their screens. It also helps them learn how to manage their distractions, which is an important life skill that will help them get through things like school and work.

To ensure that your child can do well in class, you will need to manage their refractive error. This usually means going to a trusted local eye doctor for prescription eyeglasses. But not every child wants to wear eyeglasses, especially those who are active in sports and other physical activities. This makes contact lenses a more attractive option, but is your child actually ready for them? Lumen Optometric, the leading eyecare provider in the area, shares how you can know. 1\\\\. Your child is asking if they can wear them. The decision to wear contact lenses will depend on the child. If wearing eyeglasses makes them unhappy and uncomfortable, then they will be far more motivated to take good care of their contact lenses. 2\\\\. They make an effort to be clean and hygienic. Proper use and care of contact lenses is a big responsibility. Cleanliness should always be observed to ensure safety and comfort and to prevent infections and other eye problems. If your child knows the importance of cleanliness and makes an effort to practice good hygiene, then they should be ready to wear contacts. 3\\\\. Your child does their chores without being asked repeatedly. A certain amount of discipline is required on the part of the child when it comes to contact lens use. The proper cleaning and storage of contact lenses are akin to doing household chores. When they don’t need to be told twice about what needs to be done, then they’re already a good candidate for contact lenses. 4\\\\. They are active in sports. Eyeglasses get in the way of your child’s athletic interests. By letting them wear contacts, they can maximize their potential in sports, allowing them to perform well while enjoying clearer vision.

One of these problems is diabetic eye disease, which can severely damage your vision. Diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the conditions that result from this disease. Fortunately, Lumen Optometric is here to share four steps you can take to prevent or slow down diabetic eye disease. 1\\\\. Undergo a Dilated Eye Exam Annually Diabetic patients are highly advised to visit a dilated eye exam doctor at least once a year. In this assessment, your ophthalmologist will identify early signs that diabetes is affecting your eyesight. Typically, diabetic eye diseases only show a few symptoms until the condition has advanced. If your vision starts to blur due to diabetes, consult a professional immediately to determine the best treatment for you and save you from irreversible vision loss. 2\\\\. Manage Your Blood Sugar Keep your blood sugar level in your target range by eating food that is low in sugar and carbohydrates, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood sugar. For personalized assistance, consult a primary care physician, an endocrinologist or a nutritionist. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor. 3\\\\. Control Your Blood Pressure Managing blood pressure can protect your eyes from diabetic retinopathy, which is a complication of diabetes that damages the retina. If your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are high, your tiny fragile blood vessels would react negatively, resulting in serious eye damage. In the event that your eye condition has worsened, call your eye doctor right away for corneal reshaping or other treatments. 4\\\\. Maintain an Active and Healthy Lifestyle A balanced diet and regular exercise can help control your diabetes, which can benefit your eye health. As much as possible, avoid consuming processed and fried food, an excessive amount of red meat, high sugar beverages, and food with refined carbohydrates. For a hassle free mealtime, you can ask your diabetic care team to create a meal plan that works for you and provides you with enough energy to maintain an active lifestyle. For outstanding diabetic eye care, you can rely on us at Lumen Optometric. We provide comprehensive eye examinations, contact lenses and other optical solutions.

Besides giving you the ability to see, they let you learn new skills and interact with others. Taking good care of your eyes goes a long way in maintaining good vision and avoiding sight threatening conditions. A local orthokeratology specialist gives five tips to keep your eyes healthy. 1\\\\. Schedule Regular Eye Exams Routine comprehensive eye exams help diagnose various eye conditions in their early stages, including glaucoma, cataracts and age related eye conditions. Sometimes, they also allow specialists to catch signs of other health problems, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. How often you need to get your eyes checked typically depends on your age and family history of eye disease. You may need to visit an eye exam doctor more frequently if you have an existing medical condition. 2\\\\. Keep Your Eye Prescription Up to Date Frequent headaches, constant squinting and blurred vision are common signs you need to update your prescription eyewear. If you feel relief when you remove your glasses, it definitely means you need a new pair. Moreover, experts recommend getting new corrective eyeglasses every two years. 3\\\\. Protect Your Eyes From the Sun Your eyes are just as susceptible to sun damage as your skin. When heading outdoors, be sure to wear UV blocking sunglasses. Wearing a wide brimmed hat is another thing you can do to protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays. 4\\\\. Maintain a Healthy Diet Eating well balanced meals will benefit your eyes and overall well being. Incorporate foods high in zinc, omega 3 fatty acids, and vitamins A, C, and E into your diet. Leafy greens, nuts, fish, and colorful fruits and vegetables are especially rich in these nutrients. 5\\\\. Stay Hydrated Your eyes could suffer if you don’t drink enough water. Blurred vision, eye fatigue and a stinging sensation in the eyes are typical signs of dehydration. Drink at least eight glasses of water daily to hydrate your eyes and body. Don’t wait before you experience significant changes in your vision before seeing an eye doctor. Lumen Optometric is here to handle your eye care needs.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at Lumen Optometric share daily habits that can benefit your eyes and vision. 1\\\\. Wash Your Hands Thanks to recent events, hand washing should already be part of your daily routine coming from the outdoors. Even if you stay indoors most of the time, you should wash your hands regularly. Common vision related diseases like conjunctivitis (pink eye) are caused by touching in or around the eyes with unclean hands. 2\\\\. Wear Eye Protection Whether you’re mowing the lawn, doing some woodwork in your workshop, or performing home repairs, don’t risk eye injury and always wear eye protection. Protective glasses are easy to obtain, comes in many sizes, and can be worn over existing eyeglasses. If you’re working on anything that involves welding, make sure to wear a welding mask or goggles. 3\\\\. Handle Your Contact Lenses Carefully Your contact lenses come into direct contact with your eyes; you’ll definitely want to keep them clean. Always make sure that you’re handling them with clean hands, keep your contact lens cases sterilized, and discard expired contact lens solution. If you’re undergoing dry eye treatment, your eye doctor may prescribe a different type of contact lenses, with different handling instructions. Make sure you follow them closely to avoid damage to your eyes. 4\\\\. Maintain a Healthy Diet Eating fast food every day probably won’t make you go blind, but it’s not good for your health, either. Various studies have shown that a diet that contains significant amounts of foods that are rich in Omega 3 and lutein can help reduce the risk of cataracts, night blindness, and other eye problems. 5\\\\. Rest Your Eyes Most of us spend a significant portion of the day staring at computer screens, especially those who work from home. Make sure to rest your eyes every once in a while. The “20 20 20 Rule,” is a good daily practice to turn into a habit. The rule is simple: every 20 minutes, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Doing this several times a day can help reduce eye strain. Lumen Optometric is your leading provider of eye care services, including Neurolens® treatment. Give us a call at .

But how much do you really know about this eye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll explore 5 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about your child’s eye health and long term vision. 1\\\\. Myopia is an Eye Disease Myopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. 2\\\\. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye disease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people worldwide. If things don’t change, half of the world’s population will have some degree of myopia by the year 2050! 3\\\\. It’s a Progressive Condition Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. 4\\\\. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease Myopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight threatening eye diseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50% higher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop cataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults than children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of clear vision a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided their children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic maculopathy fell by 40%. 5\\\\.

In fact, there are many reasons to have them spend time outdoors, not least of which is to protect your child’s vision. Studies show that children who spend time playing outdoors in the sunshine experience less myopia progression than those who stay indoors. Moreover, encouraging more outdoor playtime is important for promoting overall health and wellbeing in your kids. Below we’ll explore some fun outdoor activity ideas to try with your kids and discuss why spending time outdoors may slow a child’s myopia progression or even postpone its onset. 5 Outdoor Activities to Do With Your Kids This Winter 1\\\\. Snow Play If you live in a snowy region, bundle up your kids in warm layers and have them: ● Build a snowman ● Enjoy a snowball fight ● Paint the snow with some food coloring or watercolors ● Make a snow maze ● Build an igloo ● Build snow castles (the same way you would sand castles) ● Make snow angels ● Collect snowflakes during a snow flurry and study their beautiful shapes 2\\\\. Blow Ice Bubbles Kids love playing with and popping bubbles. If temperatures are low enough, they might freeze in mid air! They’ll get a kick out of watching them freeze and possibly catching or popping them. To make your own bubble solution, mix 1 part water with 4 parts dish soap and a few drops of light corn syrup. It’s best to try this activity when winds are calm, as harsh breezes can cause the bubbles to pop before they freeze. Once the bubbles have landed on a surface and are completely frozen, they are beautiful to photograph which can be part 2 of this activity. 3\\\\. Go Sledding Sledding is a classic winter activity that your child will love. To go sledding, all you need is snow, a sled, and a hill! Easy enough. But before you hit the slopes (or hills), be sure to follow these safety guidelines: ● Choose a sled that can be steered and can brake ● Wear a helmet ● Dress warmly, but be careful as the scarf can get caught under the sled ● Children 5 years old and under should sled with an adult 4\\\\. Go on a Winter Scavenger Hunt A winter scavenger hunt is a wonderful way to explore nature with all of your senses. Before you head out, make a list of things to see, smell, listen for, and feel. Ask your child to check each item off the list. For example, your list can include listening for the sounds of birds chirping, footsteps crunching in the leaves, or water babbling in a nearby stream. On the list of things to look for, you can include different types of trees, animals, animal tracks, cloud shapes, birds’ nests, and more. Take your camera along and let your child take pictures of what they find. You can also leave an empty space on the list for your child to fill as they explore new things on their own. 5\\\\. Decorate a Tree with Edible Ornaments For Animals This activity is an unconventional twist on building a bird feeder and perfect for those who live near a forest. The idea is to make edible ornaments and hang them on a tree (or potted plant in your garden) for wildlife to feed on during the winter. Your ornaments can be made using various seeds, peanut butter, dried fruit, and popcorn. It’s best to use biodegradable materials to hang your ornaments, and don’t use fishing lines, as birds can get caught in it. What’s the Connection Between Time Outdoors and Myopia? There is increasing evidence that children who spend extra time daily playing outdoors have a reduced risk of developing myopia; and if they already have myopia, time spent outdoors could slow down the worsening of this condition, also known as myopia progression. These findings are significant, as having myopia significantly increases a child’s risk of developing sight threatening eye diseases later in life. Moderate to high levels of myopia make a child more susceptible to developing cataracts, retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and glaucoma later in life. At Treehouse Eyes, our mission is to battle childhood myopia by providing myopia management to nearsighted children. Our myopia management treatments can effectively slow down your child’s myopia progression and reduce their future risk of eye disease. If your child has myopia, or if you need your first consultation, contact us today to schedule a myopia eye exam. Wishing you and all of our patients a healthy and enjoyable winter season!

This way, your trusted optometrist can detect any conditions or diseases that may trouble them later on. Which eye conditions are these exactly? Lumen Optometric, the trusted eye exam doctor in the area, offers a quick overview of some of them. Refractive Errors These refer to conditions that can cause blurry vision. Refractive errors include farsightedness (hyperopia), when close objects appear distorted, nearsightedness (myopia), when objects viewed at a distance are blurry and astigmatism, when objects both near and far are unclear. They may occur when the cornea doesn’t bend, or refract, light properly. Symptoms include a disinterest in reading or viewing distant objects and squinting or turning the head in an odd fashion when watching television. Children diagnosed with refractive errors can be treated through prescriptive glasses, and even corneal reshaping, or orthokeratology (Ortho K). The latter refers to the use of gas permeable lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia, hyperopia and refractive errors. Ortho K is a safe and effective alternative to eyeglasses, refractive surgery, or contact lenses. Amblyopia Another common eye problem in babies and young children is amblyopia or ‘lazy eye’. This happens when the vision of one or both eyes did not develop properly during childhood, or when eye conditions, such as refractive errors, weren’t corrected promptly. Strabismus Also known as cross eyes, strabismus is when the eyes aren’t aligned properly–instead pointing at different directions. This causes loss of depth perception because the child learns to ignore the image received by the misaligned eye, relying only on the one from the straight, or better seeing eye. Treatment options for strabismus may include eyeglasses and vision therapy. Ptosis When the upper eyelid droops and restricts or blocks vision, this is called ptosis. A child with this condition may tip their head back, lift up their chin, or raise their eyebrows to try to see better, which may cause head or neck problems over time. Visit your local eye doctor for a thorough eye exam if your child exhibits these symptoms. Color Deficiency Also called color blindness, this eye problem makes it difficult for the child to distinguish specific shades of color. This is usually an inherited condition, but there are also certain diseases that can cause color deficits. While there is no cure for color deficiency, there are special glasses and contact lenses your child can wear that allow them to see color differences. To prevent or avoid lasting vision problems for your child, make sure to visit a premier eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a regular eye exam.

In today’s post, your local eye doctor and scleral optometrist at Lumen Optometric shares a quick guide on contact lens solutions. Multipurpose Vs. Hydrogen Peroxide Solutions There are two types of contact lens solutions: multipurpose and hydrogen peroxide based. They serve the same purpose disinfect your contacts and remove debris but they work in different ways. Multipurpose solution, also known as all in one solution, is simple to use. Wash your hands, put your contacts in your palm, then moisten the lenses with the multipurpose solution. While some types of multipurpose solutions are marketed as “no rub” products, experts recommend rubbing the lenses with it for 10 seconds to remove remaining debris. Apply a drop of saline solution in each lense to rinse before wearing it. Hydrogen peroxide solution, on the other hand, requires more time or attention. Unlike multipurpose solutions, this type of contact lens solution does not “spoil,” and is ideal for people who are sensitive to certain chemicals, or for those undergoing therapy like dry eye treatment. Hydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at disinfecting contact lenses, but it must not touch the eye directly. To use it, fill a small case with the solution (most contact lenses come with such a case) and soak them for six to eight hours. Before taking out the contacts, a neutralizer must be applied to turn the hydrogen peroxide to a plain saline solution. Which One Should You Choose? Between the two, the multipurpose solution is the more cost effective and easy to use, and can be used virtually anywhere as long as you have a contact lens case or a clean surface to clean them in. However, it is not as effective at disinfecting contact lenses as the hydrogen peroxide solution. Making it an all in one solution requires certain chemicals that may not be ideal for some people who may be sensitive to certain substances. This also means it has a shorter shelf life. The hydrogen peroxide solution is more effective at cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses, but there is a risk of harming the eye if one were to forget applying the neutralizer. It is also important not to reuse or top off the solution after use. Contact lens cases must also be replaced every one to three months to cut the risk of infection.

But apart from the style of your eyeglass frame, you should also look into the frame materials. Lumen Optometric, a trusted scleral optometrist and eyeglass provider, discusses some of the most popular materials used for eyeglass frames. Titanium Titanium is commonly used in designer glasses. It is an excellent material for eyeglass frames and hinges because it is very lightweight, sturdy, hypoallergenic and corrosion resistant. However, titanium is significantly more expensive than other frame materials. Titanium alloy, which is a combination of titanium and other metals, is typically used as a cheaper alternative to titanium. Stainless Steel Stainless steel is a reliable material for eyeglass materials. It’s durable, strong, hypoallergenic and non corrosive. It may not be as lightweight as other materials, but it can be easily shaped into ultra thin eyewear frames. Stainless steel is also flexible, and this usually adds to the comfort of eyeglass wearers. So whether you are wearing glasses most of the time or you’re only using it temporarily while undergoing dry eye treatment, this type of frame material can be really comfortable for you. Plastic Zyl or propionate is typically used in making the plastic frame material. Zyl, which is also known as cellulose acetate, is the most common type of plastic frame material. Meanwhile, propionate is the second most popular plastic frame material. It is hypoallergenic and nylon based, and it has a different look and feel than other types of plastic. Lumen Optometric has expertise in different kinds of eye care services. Whether you’re considering Neurolens treatment or you’re simply looking for a new pair of glasses, our staff will ensure that your needs are met.

What’s less well known is what these different eye conditions are. Presbyopia is one of these diseases. It’s a condition that usually affects people aged over 40 and makes it harder for their eyes to focus on objects. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing small print, such as text messages, clearly. No need to worry though to help restore your vision, a scleral optometrist will prescribe you multifocal lenses if you’re a good candidate for one. In general, there are three types of multifocal lenses: Bifocal lenses – As the name suggests, bifocal lenses have two prescriptions: the upper lens helps you see objects from afar while the lower lens helps you read and focus on objects near you.Trifocal lenses – Like bifocal lenses, trifocal lenses have upper and lower lenses that help you with distance vision and reading respectively. The difference between the two is that trifocal lenses, as the name suggests, have a middle section that helps you with tasks that require intermediate vision, like using a laptop. Progressive lenses – Progressive lens don’t have the lines found on bifocal or trifocal lenses. That’s because the power of the lenses gradually changes from the top to the bottom. Adjusting to Your New Bifocal Lenses Multifocal lenses will take some getting used to. Here are some tips on adjusting to your new multifocal lenses: Wear your multifocal lenses all the time – You’ll get used to your new multifocal lenses faster if you wear them all the time. Don’t look down while walking or going down the stairs – The lower part of your bifocal lenses makes everything look bigger, so your feet may appear out of focus. If you need to look down while walking, make sure to tilt your head up and look through the upper portion of your multifocal lenses. Make sure your new multifocal eyeglasses fit your face properly – It’s harder to get used to multifocal eyeglasses and lenses if they don’t fit your face properly. For more info about your multifocal lenses, neurolens treatment, and your other treatment options, don’t hesitate to consult your eye doctor. Looking for eye specialists near you?

This assessment is crucial to diagnosing, preventing and treating eye conditions that could lead to vision loss. To help you further understand what dilated eye exams are, Lumen Optometric is here to answer the most commonly asked questions about this process. “What Is a Dilated Eye Exam?” A dilated eye exam involves pupil dilation, which is a simple and painless procedure performed to increase the size of the pupils. This process allows your ophthalmologist to assess the health of your optic nerve and retina. If you are nearsighted or farsighted, your eye doctor will give you dilating eye drops to check vision problems that hinder you from seeing clearly. “What Conditions Can It Detect?” Glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinal detachment and ocular tumor are some of the conditions that can be diagnosed with a dilated eye exam. This procedure provides optimum viewing of the dilated pupil, which allows for the diagnosis and monitoring of the retina. While there are some diseases that can be detected without pupil dilation, a dilated eye exam is still important to ensure an accurate and complete diagnosis. “What Can I Expect During the Exam?” When your eyes are dilated, your vision may be blurry and your eyes may be sensitive to light for a few hours. For your safety, ask a loved one to drive you home from your eye appointment. In case your eye doctor finds refractive errors in your vision, they may provide you with a prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses to help improve your eyesight. At Lumen Optometric, we are committed to providing only the best eye care services to help you take care of your vision problems.

Are you curious about the neurolens treatment and want to learn more? In today’s article, Lumen Optometric answers some frequently asked questions about neurolenses. How Does It Work? The neurolens Measurement test will determine if you are a good candidate for neurolenses. These lenses are the first and only prescription lenses that can help correct the misalignment in a patient’s vision at all distances. Using neurolenses has been found to relieve symptoms like neck pain tension, eyestrain, headaches and eye fatigue. How Often Should I Use It? Your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen Optometric recommends that you wear your neurolenses during all your waking hours for the best results. If this is not possible, then you should at least wear these lenses while doing near work like reading or using a digital device. In general, you should see results with your neurolenses within your first three to seven days of wearing them. Some patients might take longer however, sometimes taking up to three weeks. Does It Still Work If I Use Contacts or If I Have 20 20 Vision? Your new neurolenses incorporate both your regular eyeglasses prescription and your contoured prism prescription. If you prefer wearing contact lenses, then you can order your neurolenses to only use your contoured prism prescription. You’ll just need to wear your neurolenses while wearing your contacts. This also means that people with 20 20 vision can still use neurolenses if they suffer from misalignment.

We meet dozens of parents and children every day who come in for eye exams, myopia treatments and other services. During these visits, we welcome and address questions or concerns that parents have about their child’s eye health. Because certain myopia treatments include contact lens wear, many parents ask whether they’re safe to wear for young children. Here’s what the research says: A recent study, Adverse Event Rates in The Retrospective Cohort Study of Safety of Paediatric Soft Contact Lens Wear: the ReCSS Study, shows that contact lenses for children are just as safe for children as they are for adults. (This study appears in the January 2021 issue of the peer reviewed Journal of Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics.) The study followed 963 children aged 8 to 16 over the course of 1.5 to 3 years (for a combined 2713 years of contact lens wear time) to determine the risk level associated with wearing soft contact lenses. All of the subjects were 13 years of age or under at the time of their first fitting, with more than half of the children fitted with soft contacts at or before the age of 10, on average. The study results indicate that age doesn’t play a role in contact lens safety. In fact, the risks of developing adverse reactions to contact lens wear among children proved to be the same as in adults. According to the study, the rate of inflammatory conditions associated with contact lens wear were less than 1% per year of wear. Multifocal Lenses for One effective method of myopia management includes the use of MiSight daily multifocal soft contact lenses. MiSight contact lenses are FDA approved for the treatment of myopia and have been shown to effectively slow down the rate of myopia progression. Many parents like this method as it requires minimal maintenance; at bedtime, the child discards the pair they are wearing, and inserts a fresh pair in the morning. It also rids the child of the need to wear glasses during the day, allowing them to freely partake in sports and other activities. The myopia management program at Treehouse Eyes can help preserve your child’s gift of sight for a lifetime. Treating your child’s myopia will give them clear vision today, while reducing their chances of developing sight threatening eye diseases later in life. it’s never too early to start treating myopia.

November 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Today, you can have your eyes checked without actually seeing your eye doctor using online vision tests. Many eye clinics offer these tests that you can accomplish via your smartphone. They claim to determine how sharp your vision is, if you have astigmatism, or experiencing eye sensitivity. Discover if online eye tests are any good and when they are useful from a local eye exam doctor. Are Online Eye Tests as Good as Visiting Your Eye Doctor? Typically, an online eye test only checks your visual acuity and gives an estimate of your refractive error. Sometimes, it includes contrast sensitivity and color blindness. However, this kind of test can’t determine if you have conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, or macular degeneration. Keep in mind that routine eye exams with your eye doctor are still irreplaceable. Get your eyes checked as frequently as advised by your eye specialist. Regular comprehensive eye exams can help with the early detection and treatment of different eye conditions, especially those that don’t show symptoms until their later stages. When Are They Helpful? When you’re away, and you break or lose your glasses or contact lenses, that’s when online eye tests are most useful. Sometimes, an online vision test can help keep track of your eyesight and refractive error between routine eye exams. Still, it helps to know that the results of some online eye tests have been validated with limited studies because it’s still a new and developing technology. More studies are required to ensure the accuracy of prescriptions generated by online vision tests. For your family’s eye care needs, turn to Lumen Optometric.

These may develop because of an age related change, when the tiny openings (puncta) that allow tears to drain become narrower, which can cause a blockage. Other common reasons include infection of the eyes, tear duct system, or nasal passages. An injury or trauma can also result in blocked tear ducts. This can be as minor as foreign particles getting lodged in the eyes, or as serious as a blow to the head or a broken nose. What are the Symptoms of Blocked Tear Ducts? Watery eyes and excess tears streaming from the eyes may be signs of a blocked tear duct. But these may be accompanied by: Redness and irritation of the affected eyeCrust forming along the eyelidsExcess mucus or discharge from the eyesEye infections, like pink eye or conjunctivitisPain and inflammation of the inside corner of the eyeBlurred vision You should note, however, that watery eyes due to cold or sinus infection may be unrelated to a blocked tear duct. The same goes for swelling or redness in the eyes, which may be a result of an injury that doesn’t affect the tear ducts. When you’re experiencing some or most of the symptoms mentioned above, you should go see Lumen Optometric, your trusted local eye doctor promptly. We don’t just specialize in dry eye treatment–we can also manage a number of other eye conditions. How Do You Deal with Blocked Tear Ducts? While a blocked tear duct can result in discomfort and swelling, it is almost always correctable. Its treatment will depend on its underlying cause. To accurately pinpoint the reason for your blocked tear ducts, we’ll perform a comprehensive eye examination and, depending on the results, recommend the effective and appropriate solution. Whether you need to deal with blocked tear ducts or considering neurolens treatment, Lumen Optometric has got you covered.

Blog eye care Can Blue Light Glasses Protect Kids From Digital Eye Strain?Can Blue Light Glasses Protect Kids From Digital Eye Strain? January 8, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Today, children are more exposed to digital devices, which makes a lot of parents worry. Using devices like computers, cellphones, and tablets can result in digital eye strain. One of the things that are believed to help prevent the condition is blue light glasses. Find out if blue light glasses can protect children against digital eye strain from a scleral optometrist. Where Does Blue Light Come From? Blue light is visible light with shorter wavelengths but more energy than other light at the other end of the color spectrum. The main source of blue light is the sun but it can also come from your digital devices, LED lights, television screens, and fluorescent lights. Fortunately, there is no known evidence that blue light from screens is damaging to a child’s eyes. Do Blue Light Glasses Work? Kids who spend hours in front of screens are more prone to develop digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome. Among the most common signs of this eye condition are eye fatigue, headaches, shoulder or neck pain, changes in vision, and dry eye. To keep track of your child’s vision and ensure their eyes are healthy, visit your eye doctor regularly. At Lumen Optometric, you can count on us to take care of your child’s eyes. We specialize in myopia treatment, dry eye treatment, and more. Blue light glasses are available in prescription and non prescription lenses. These glasses have a slight yellow tint to the lenses and can help prevent digital eye strain in children. However, these glasses do not completely filter all blue light but they can reduce your child’s exposure by up to at least 80 percent. Still, the best way to prevent this eye condition is limiting your child’s screen time, especially for younger ones. For your family’s eye care needs, Lumen Optometric is here to help. We offer neurolens treatment, scleral lenses, orthokeratology, and more. Call us at or fill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

Let’s explore the efficacy of correcting visual habits in mitigating its advancement. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent ocular condition with multifaceted causes and implications. In this post, we delve into whether myopia can worsen despite corrected visual habits. The Mechanisms of Myopia Occurrence: The journey of myopia onset is intricate and begins before visual symptoms manifest. Research indicates that the eye undergoes accelerated axial growth one to two years before myopia becomes clinically evident. During this period, compensatory mechanisms within the eye attempt to counteract the elongation, including the flattening of the anterior surface of the lens. However, these mechanisms eventually exhaust themselves, leading to the establishment of myopic refractive status an early to mid stage irreversible pathological change. The Influence of Age on Myopia Progression: Understanding the age at which myopia sets in is crucial in predicting its progression. Studies suggest that the earlier myopia occurs and the faster it progresses, the less responsive it is to interventions aimed at improving visual habits. This underscores the importance of early detection and intervention in younger individuals to potentially mitigate the severity of myopia progression. Challenges in Eliminating Causative Visual Habits: While correcting visual habits is a fundamental aspect of managing myopia, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges associated with eliminating causative factors. Factors such as excessive near work, limited outdoor time, and genetic predispositions contribute to myopia development. Despite concerted efforts to modify these habits, complete eradication remains elusive, posing a continued risk for myopia progression. Conclusion : In conclusion, the journey of myopia progression is complex, and influenced by various factors including age, genetic predispositions, and environmental habits. While correcting visual habits is beneficial, it’s crucial to recognize the limitations in eliminating causative factors. Early intervention remains key in potentially slowing down myopia progression, emphasizing the importance of regular eye exams and proactive management strategies. At Treehouse Eyes, we’re committed to empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources to navigate their myopia journey effectively.

Blog eye care Can Poor Sleeping Habits Affect Your Eyes?Can Poor Sleeping Habits Affect Your Eyes? June 10, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Sleep is crucial to your health and to every part of your body, including your eyes. It ensures that your eyes have enough moisture and rest to perform well. If you are not getting enough sleep, this could affect your eyes and increase your risks of various side effects ranging from mild (dark circles and puffy eyes) to severe (eye infections and vision loss). Lumen Optometric, a trusted provider of contact lenses and eye care services, further discusses the negative impact of poor sleeping habits on your overall eye health. Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Eyes One common but less dangerous effect of poor sleep is having dark circles underneath your eyes. Some people, though, are more prone to having puffy eyes rather than dark circles after a night of inadequate sleep. In other cases, when people are not able to get enough sleep, they experience eye spasms and twitching throughout the day. This often makes it difficult to do work or activities like reading. It can also pose hazards if you are driving. Another usual side effect of sleep deprivation is having strained, dry and itchy eyes the next day. This is a slightly more serious effect of poor sleep. Dry eyes specifically can be painful and it can cause irritation. This is mainly because your eyes are not getting proper lubrication. Lack of sleep may also cause your eyes to be sensitive to light or your vision to be blurry. People who don’t get enough sleep have an increased risk of glaucoma, a condition caused by excessive buildup inside the eye. If you have been experiencing these symptoms more frequently, make sure to visit an eye exam doctor. You should also address the source of your eye symptoms in this case, poor sleeping habits. Tips on Improving Your Sleep Remember that your eyes go through a lot whenever you’re awake. They work several hours a day, so it is important to give them enough time to recover through sleep. If you are having problems getting a good quality of sleep, here are some tips that might help you: Exercise regularly. This can help you sleep better, but make sure to avoid it three hours before your bedtime.Get as much sunlight as you can during the day.As much as possible, avoid exposure to blue light and digital screens at least two hours before bedtime.Consider wearing an eye mask if you get stimulated even by the faintest of lights at night. You can also try blackout blinds to prevent outdoor lights from seeping into your bedroom.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says 90% of these incidents are preventable. Generally, the kind of eye protection you need depends on the potential hazards present in your workplace. A local orthokeratology expert shares some of the most common causes of workplace eye injuries. What Are the Common Causes of Workplace Eye Injuries? Flying Objects Does your job involve sanding, riveting, chiseling, hammering, riveting or machining? If so, you must wear appropriate eye protection like safety glasses, face shields or goggles. These tasks can expose you to small flying objects that can enter your eyes, including metal fragments, wood particles and cement chips. Chemicals You must be careful when working with chemicals because they can cause irreversible eye damage. Proper safety gear will protect your eyes from chemical splashes, fumes and vapors. Gasoline, grease, oil and paint thinner can also harm your eyes. Object or Tool Penetration Permanent eye damage can occur due to the penetration of tools or sharp objects. When this incident happens, seek medical attention immediately. Always wear safety glasses and avoid tools you have no experience using. Radiation Lasers and welding equipment can produce high levels of infrared, ultraviolet radiation and heat. Workers need to wear safety goggles when performing tasks involving these tools. Doing so will protect them from eye problems like cataracts, retinal burns and blindness. Which Eye Problems Usually Occur at Work? Digital Eye Strain Many jobs today require you to stare at digital screens for hours. If you spend a significant time in front of a computer, you might experience digital eye strain. Headaches, dry eyes and blurred vision characterize this condition. It can also cause neck and shoulder pain. These symptoms can occur due to glare on screens, poor seating posture and improper viewing distances. Uncorrected refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism can also trigger digital eye strain symptoms. The only way to know if you need prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses is to get an eye exam. Moreover, taking breaks from computer screens and ensuring good lighting will help alleviate eye strain. Eye Infection Usually, eye diseases spread in the workplace through droplets from sneezing or coughing. You might develop an eye infection if you accidentally touch your eyes with contaminated hands. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis occurs from exposure to Staphylococcus species and other bacteria. Its symptoms include eye redness, burning and a sensation of having something inside the eye. Artificial tears, antibiotics and other topical medications are the common treatment options for this eye condition. Regular visits to your eye exam doctor will go a long way in keeping your eyes healthy and maintaining good vision. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care needs.

You may be dealing with what’s known as computer vision syndrome (CVS). An orthokeratology and eyecare expert explores the causes and symptoms of CVS and how this condition can be corrected. Causes and Symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome Extended screen time, a lack of sufficient lighting, poor posture and bad visual habits can lead to computer vision syndrome. Over time, our eyes have a hard time focusing and refocusing on digital screens, causing multiple discomforts. The main symptoms of CVS include difficulty shifting focus, dry or itchy eyes, recurrent headaches, and blurred or double vision. In some cases, it may also cause neck, shoulder, and back pain, creating a ripple effect on your overall well being. Can Computer Vision Syndrome Be Corrected? The good news is that computer vision syndrome can be corrected. It is not a permanent condition, so your vision can improve significantly with the right approach and professional help. Here are just some of the methods that can be employed: Eye Exercises Specific eye exercises can be suggested by your eye exam doctor to alleviate the symptoms of CVS. These exercises can help strengthen your eye muscles and improve your eyes’ ability to focus. Prescription Glasses In some cases, prescription glasses specially designed for computer use may be recommended. These glasses have coatings to reduce glare and block harmful blue light emitted by digital screens. Vision Therapy This is a customized program of visual activities designed to correct specific vision problems and improve visual skills. Vision therapy can help treat CVS by training the eye muscles to reduce strain and improve visual comfort when using screens. Lubricating Eye Drops Dry eye is another symptom of CVS, and you can use lubricating eye drops to combat it. These drops help replenish your eye’s surface and maintain moisture. Environmental Modifications This could include adjusting the lighting in your workspace to reduce glare, positioning your computer screen at an optimal distance and angle, and increasing the font size on your screen to reduce eye strain.

During this appointment, your eye care professional will assess your eyes and determine the most suitable type of contact lenses for your needs. Here’s what you can expect during your contact lens fitting session. Assessment of Your Eye Health and Vision Needs Your eye care professional will begin by reviewing your medical and eye health history. This examination includes a check of visual acuity, an evaluation of eye movements and an examination of the general well being of your eyes to determine whether eye conditions might affect your suitability for wearing contact lenses. Precision Measurements for a Perfect Fit Following the eye health assessment, the optometrist or ophthalmologist will meticulously measure the curvature and diameter of your corneas. These measurements are crucial for determining the correct size and type of contact lenses that will provide the best fit for your eyes, preventing discomfort and potential complications. For instance, scleral lenses are larger than standard contact lenses and rest on the white part of your eye, the sclera. Due to their design, optometrists perform a more detailed fitting process for scleral contact lenses than regular contacts. Tailoring to Your Lifestyle and Preferences Your lifestyle and preferences play a significant role in the recommendation of suitable contact lenses. The eye care professional will take into account factors such as your level of physical activity, preferred wearing schedule and specific vision correction needs. Communicating your preferences ensures personalized recommendations. Follow Up Appointment A follow up appointment is typically scheduled after a week or two to ensure you adapt well to your new contact lenses. Your eye care professional will check for any changes in eye health and may adjust your prescription or lens type if necessary. They can also help you identify issues like dry eyes that could affect lens comfort and recommend dry eye treatment as needed. Contact lens fitting is a comprehensive process that requires professional expertise for the best outcome. Lumen Optometric is a premier eye care provider dedicated to improving your eye health.

Worry not we’re here to clear up all the confusion. Read on as Lumen Optometric explains why, when, and how your contact lenses may impact your examination results. Should You Wear or Not Wear Contact Lenses for an Eye Exam? Eye exams sometimes involve more than just reading a standard eye chart. There can be several tests, each targeting a different aspect of your eye health. The primary concern with leaving your lenses in during the exam is the potential for inaccuracies. Contact lenses can disguise certain eye conditions or changes in your prescription. They might also obscure indications of dry eye, a condition that demands effective treatment early on. As such, it is preferable to take contact lenses out at least two hours before the appointment. Doing so allows your cornea to revert to its natural shape which can be altered by prolonged contact lens wear ensuring a more accurate examination. Discussing Your Contact Lens Concerns During an Eye Examination During your eye exam, be sure to discuss your contact lens experiences with your eye care provider. This way, they can evaluate your eyes with them on and off. For instance, if you mention issues with blurry vision or eye fatigue, they might consider a neurolens treatment, a revolutionary option for correcting misalignments and bringing comfort. Likewise, if you’re a candidate for scleral lenses, they will have a specialized understanding of your contact lens fitting. Lenses should not just correct vision but should also promote overall eye health.

September 1, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Contact lenses offer a safe and effective way to correct poor vision, being especially useful to those who find eyeglasses inconvenient or uncomfortable. But in order to get the most out of your contact lenses, you’ll need to make sure they’re worn properly. Some people, for instance, leave their contact lenses in for too long, which is risky and highly discouraged. Lumen Optometric, the premier eye exam doctor in the area, explains more. Why You Shouldn’t Overwear Contact Lenses Avoid wearing your contact lenses for too long in a day, and you absolutely shouldn’t leave them on when you sleep. Doing so can lead to complications with your eyesight. In fact, prolonged contact lens use may cause the wearer to experience the following symptoms: Inflammation of the cornea, or keratitisRedness and swelling of the conjunctiva, or the transparent skin covering the whites of the eyesEyelid swellingLight sensitivityBlurred visionDry eyesBurning sensation when the contact lens are inserted But How Long Is ‘Too Long’? The period may vary with each patient, but it’s generally recommended that contact lenses are worn for a maximum of 10 12 hours each day. Anything longer than that can put the eyes at risk of infection and discomfort. If you’re using contact lenses for the first time (and don’t have dry, sensitive eyes) your eye care specialist may suggest wearing them for 6 8 hours on that first day. How to Deal With Overwear If you’ve left your contact lenses for too long and are now experiencing adverse effects, the first thing you’ll need to do is visit a trusted eye doctor like Lumen Optometric for a comprehensive eye exam and the necessary solution. Our eye specialists will suspend contact lens wear until all the symptoms have been resolved. As your eyes heal, we may suggest switching to a new lens material with higher oxygen permeability, or recommend using daily disposable lenses.

This condition pertains to the clouding of the lens of the eye. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 17.2% of Americans older than 40 have cataracts in one or both eyes. While a common eye condition, many myths still surround cataracts. A local orthokeratology specialist debunks five of them. 1\\\\. Cataracts Only Occur in Older Adults One of the most popular misconceptions about cataracts is that they only occur in older adults. The truth is they can be present at birth. Cataracts can also develop in younger individuals, and some medications can increase your risk for cataracts, such as corticosteroids. 2\\\\. Overusing Your Eyes Can Cause Cataracts How much you use your eyes doesn’t have anything to do with your risk of developing cataracts. However, cataracts can make doing up close work more challenging. While healthy lifestyle changes can’t prevent cataracts, they can slow down the eye condition’s progression. 3\\\\. Eye Drops Can Treat Cataracts No eye drops can prevent or dissolve cataracts. Cataracts are not growths but changes in the structure of the lens. Removing and replacing the affected lens is the only way to treat this eye condition. If you have cataracts, only an eye exam doctor can determine which treatment option suits you. 4\\\\. Cataract Surgery Is Risky Cataract surgery is one of today’s safest procedures, with a success rate of 95%. It’s painless and only takes around 15 to 20 minutes. You can usually leave the hospital a few hours following the surgery. Most patients recover within four weeks, but some notice a significant improvement in their vision a few days after the procedure. 5\\\\. Cataracts Can Go Back Following Surgery Once the affected lens has been replaced, cataracts will not recur. However, some people may experience cloudy vision because the membrane holding the synthetic lens can decline with age. Fortunately, a quick and safe in office laser procedure can address this issue.

However, beware of what is and isn’t true about your eyes. Doing your research and learning the truth can help you better take care of your eyes. A local scleral optometrist debunks some of the most common myths about vision and eye health. Reading in the Dark Is Harmful to Your Eyes Your mom has probably told you that you shouldn’t read in the dark because it will damage your eyes. Reading in low lighting conditions may lead to eye fatigue or a headache but it can’t cause permanent damage. Constantly Wearing Your Glasses Will Weaken Your Eyes Wearing glasses will not make your eyes weak. While some eye conditions will get worse over the years, it doesn’t have anything to do with glasses. Moreover, your glasses are there to help you see better and correct your vision. Using Digital Devices a Lot Is Bad for Your Eyes Using your phone, computer, and other digital devices for an extended period can result in eye fatigue. However, it will not result in nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. To avoid eye strain, make sure you’re taking breaks in between using your devices. It would also help to wear the right eyewear. At Lumen Optometric, we offer neurolens treatment and other vision correction options. Eating Carrots Will Make Your Vision Better Another common myth about your vision is that it will improve by eating carrots. This vegetable is rich in vitamin A, which is necessary for you to maintain good eyesight. However, your body only needs a tiny amount of vitamin A for vision and you can get it from other sources like fish, dairy, darky leafy greens, and bright colored vegetables.

In this blog post, we’ll explore this topic and examine the existing evidence surrounding the relationship between sleep patterns and vision in children and teenagers. The Link Between Sleep Habits and Vision: Currently, there’s a lack of direct clinical trial evidence confirming the precise impact of sleep habits on vision. However, intriguing findings from animal models provide suggestive insights into this connection. Disrupting the overall circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep wake cycles, may potentially influence refractive development in the eye. Understanding the Role of Circadian Rhythm: The eye is a complex organ, with various components operating on their own biological rhythms. These include the cornea, choroid, intraocular pressure, and lens. Disrupting these biological rhythms can affect the rate of eye growth, potentially impacting vision development over time. Indirect Evidence and Myopia Risk: While direct clinical evidence is lacking, indirect evidence from animal models suggests that staying up late and waking up late common habits among children and teenagers may increase the risk of myopia. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a prevalent vision condition characterized by difficulty seeing distant objects clearly. Considerations and Caution: It’s essential to interpret these findings with caution and recognize the limitations of extrapolating animal model data to human populations. While suggestive, these findings do not provide definitive answers regarding the impact of sleep habits on vision in children and teenagers. Conclusion: In conclusion, the relationship between sleep habits and vision in children and teenagers remains an area of ongoing research and investigation. While animal model studies suggest a potential link between disrupted circadian rhythms and vision development, direct clinical evidence is needed to confirm these findings in human populations. Fostering healthy sleep habits for children is essential for overall well being, including their vision health. Encouraging consistent sleep schedules and adequate rest may contribute to optimal vision development.

May 8, 2020 by Lumen Optometric It’s not uncommon to feel irritation or scratchiness in our eyes. This sensation is typically associated with dry eye and seasonal allergies, even though the difference between the two is often muddled. This may be due to the fact that both conditions can affect our eyes simultaneously, the symptoms overlapping. Fortunately, with a specific dry eye treatment and simple lifestyle tweaks, your visual issues can still be corrected. What Is Dry Eye? Dry eye is a common problem that is likely to occur after age 50. It is a condition experienced by people who don’t have enough quality tears to lubricate and nourish their eyes. Dry eye can occur due to several causes, including tears not being made properly and tears evaporating too fast. Other patients may have a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, where the glands in the eyelids become clogged, preventing the production of oil found in tears. More than 86% of all patients with dry eye have this condition. Another possible reason for dry eye is ocular misalignment which can be corrected by neurolens treatment. Is It Seasonal Allergies? The symptoms of seasonal allergies can be similar to dry eye, but the indicating sign is itchiness. When the eye is exposed to an allergen like pollen and pet dander, histamines are released, causing the eyes to itch or tear. If seasonal allergies are affecting your eye, taking antihistamine can be quite effective to fight the inflammation. There are other steps you can take to ease your allergy symptoms. Close the windows and doors in your eyes when the pollen count is high outdoors. Use clean mattress covers on your bed to prevent dust mites. Use a dehumidifier in your home when humidity levels are high to prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Wear sunglasses when you’re outside to help keep pollen out of your eyes. When experiencing a severe dry eye, it’s safer not to assume the cause and instead seek out professional advice from an eye doctor or a scleral optometrist. Here at Lumen Optometric, we can expertly determine the cause of your symptoms and prescribe the appropriate treatment plan. Call us today at or fill out this contact form to schedule an appointment.

Read on to discover how sports eyewear can help improve your performance and where you can find personalized eyewear solutions just right for your sport of choice. Benefits of Wearing Sports Eyewear The right sports eyewear can be a game changer in the following ways: Enhancing Visual Performance Stepping up your game begins with seeing the game better. Sports eyewear, whether it’s a simple pair of sports glasses or customized contact lenses, can significantly enhance your ability to focus and see clearly. For every basketball player aiming for the hoop or a tennis player watching out for the incoming serve, better vision equals better performance. Protective Features Beyond improving your vision, another crucial reason to wear sports eyewear is to protect your eyes from potential injuries. High speed sports like hockey or racquetball create numerous opportunities for errant balls or pucks to cause serious harm to your eyes. Protective sports eyewear can guard against these risks and provide peace of mind as you play. Importance of Correct Prescription and Fit Just like the right cleats or a cozy pair of gloves, having the proper prescription and fit for sports eyewear is essential. An incorrect prescription can defeat the purpose of wearing eyewear and hinder your game performance. Similarly, eyewear that doesn’t fit securely can become a distraction or slip off at an inconvenient time. It’s crucial to consult an eye exam doctor to ensure your prescription is up to date and your eyewear fits well. Different Types of Sports Eyewear Depending on the sport, there are many types of eyewear to choose from. Sports Glasses These are excellent for those who require a prescription for their vision but also need the structural robustness to withstand physical sports. Sports glasses typically have reinforced frames and lenses to maintain their shape and performance. Prescription Sports Goggles For those involved in high impact sports, prescription sports goggles offer a higher level of protection. They fit snugly to your face to prevent any foreign objects or harsh sunlight from impairing your vision. Sports Sunglasses For those sunny outdoor games, sports sunglasses not only improve your vision but also shield your eyes from harmful UV rays, helping to prevent long term eye damage. Lumen Optometric: Enhancing Your Sports Performance At Lumen Optometric, we aim to help you find the ideal eyewear for your sporting needs. We offer comprehensive eye exams to ascertain your precise prescription and orthokeratology services for those looking for a lens free solution.

These are often serious and need medical attention. Neurolens treatment specialist Lumen Optometric has shared below what you need to do if you have the following injuries: Embedded Foreign Object If an object, such as a piece of glass or metal, penetrates or enters the globe of the eye and or is sticking out, you’ll need to call for emergency medical help or bring the child to the emergency room as soon as possible. You should also cover the affected eye with a small cup taped in place so that it keeps all pressure off the eye. Make sure to keep your child (and yourself) as calm and comfortable as possible until help arrives. Irritations If your child has dirt, sand, or other foreign bodies on their eye surface, our resident scleral optometrist recommends that you wash your hands thoroughly and examine the eye. Don’t touch, rub, or press the eye itself except by flushing, as other methods can easily scratch the surface, especially the cornea. Next, tilt your child’s head over a basin or sink with the affected eye down and gently pull down the lower lid. Encourage your child to open the eyes as wide as possible, but if it’s an infant or small child, it’s helpful to have a second person hold the child’s eyes open while you flush. Afterward, gently pour a steady stream of lukewarm water from a pitcher or faucet over the eye, and flush for up to 15 minutes. Check the eye every 5 minutes to see if the foreign body has been flushed out. When you need to have your eyes checked by a trusted dry eye treatment expert, don’t hesitate to visit Lumen Optometric.

It can cause damage to your eye’s optic nerve and can lead to permanent vision loss. While there’s still no cure for this condition, early detection and treatment can help slow its progression and prevent vision loss. A neurolens treatment specialist shares essential things you should know about glaucoma. Certain Groups of People Are at Higher Risk All people can get glaucoma but there are groups of individuals who are at higher risk. People over 60, individuals with a family history of glaucoma, diabetes patients, and African Americans over 40 are more likely to develop glaucoma. People with diabetes have twice the risk of getting glaucoma. Glaucoma is also six to eight times more likely to occur in African Americans than whites. Routine Eye Exams Helps With Early Detection and Treatment Seeing your eye doctor regularly can help with the early detection and treatment of glaucoma. Your eye care specialist may prescribe eye drops to keep the condition from progressing. If you are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma, you may need to schedule eye exams more frequently. Whether you need an eye exam or dry eye treatment, Lumen Optometric is here to help. A Healthy Lifestyle Can Help You Avoid Vision Loss Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and eating a nourishing diet can help you avoid glaucoma related vision loss. It will also help to control your blood pressure, maintain a healthy weight, and quit smoking if you do.

It is gas permeable and it creates a saline filled reservoir over your eye’s cornea. Scleral lenses can be used to treat various corneal conditions and they are among the safest and most effective forms of visual correction. To help get satisfactory results and to ensure that your scleral lenses continue to be safe and reliable as you use them, scleral lenses and dry eye treatment expert Lumen Optometric shares some tips below. Know When to Remove Your Lenses Most scleral lens wearers can comfortably wear their lenses for 12 to 14 hours. However, experts recommend taking the lenses off one hour before you go to sleep. Moreover, if your lenses fog throughout the day and you feel like you need to remove them already, don’t hesitate to do so. Typically, fogging occurs as a result of poor alignment of the lens with the eye. In this kind of situation, the lens rocks and causes mucus to form. The mucus then becomes trapped in the saline layer of the lens, which causes the blurry vision. That said, it is important to get the best fit of scleral lenses for your eyes in order to minimize filming or fogging. Rub Lenses After Removing Make sure to rub your lenses after removing them so as to remove surface debris. You can ask your scleral optometrist to demonstrate the proper way of doing this so that you can avoid damaging the lenses. Generally, it is ideal to rub each lens for two to 20 seconds, depending on your care solution. Use a Filling Solution With No Preservatives A preservative free filling solution is the best way to keep your eye’s health at an optimum level. Regular eye drops can cause damage to your eyes and your lenses because these often contain preservatives, so you should avoid using them at all times.

Do you experience these two problems at the same time as well? Is there a way to avoid or lessen their effects? Dry eye treatment experts from Lumen Optometric share some info! Dry Eye and Migraines Studies have been conducted on the theory of dry eye and migraines being involved with one another and worsening the effects of both. A study titled Tear Osmolarity and Subjective Dry Eye Symptoms in Migraine Sufferers was made in 2017 and was made to explore this correlation. Tear osmolarity refers to the amount of salt content in an individual’s tears. Tear osmolarity is a regular test for dry eyes, as the higher the salt content of a person’s tears, the more prone they are to dry eye. In the above mentioned study, they had 34 migraineurs in the research group, and during the observation period, migraine attacks were generally accompanied by dry eye. Additionally, the more frequent the migraine attacks became, their tear osmolarity also increased. To summarize, the study focused on the link between migraines, dry eye, and tear osmolarity. And during the study, when migraines occurred, the effects of dry eye were also observed. And the more migraines with severe pain and discomfort the research subjects experienced, the saltier their tears became, resulting in them becoming more susceptible to dry eye. Dry Eye Treatment Contact lens users are very susceptible to the effects of dry eye, and these lenses need the right amount of lubrication to function comfortably on the surface of the eyes. If you’re someone who uses a contact lens and has been having bouts of dry eye, contacting your scleral optometrist or nearest eye clinic would be the best course of action. If you’re getting dry eye that comes with migraine, lessening the effects of both is possible by getting the proper dry eye prescription and taking standard medications against migraines. Commonly, treatment for dry eye is done by the use of artificial tears, as dry eye happens when your eyes can’t get the right amount of lubrication they need. With eyes that lack the proper amount of lubrication, artificial tears are the optimal way to address dry eye. They are available over the counter and come in the form of liquid, gel, or ointment types. If your eyes are always tearing up and lessening your tear reserves, getting assistance from an eye care clinic and requesting tear duct plugs is a good way to prevent dry eye. Contact Us!

Determining the cause of your eye discomfort can be tricky, and getting the correct diagnosis and treatment to find relief is essential. Continue reading to learn the difference between eye allergies and infections, their symptoms, and when it’s time to seek professional help. Symptoms of Eye Allergies If you’re dealing with an eye allergy, some common symptoms might include itching and redness, as well as watery or teary eyes. Your eyelids may also appear swollen and you could experience sensitivity to light. These symptoms are usually caused by your body’s immune response to allergens, leading to inflammation and discomfort. Symptoms of Eye Infections On the other hand, eye infections often come with different symptoms, such as pain or discomfort in the eye itself. You may notice yellow, green, or bloody discharge and crusting around the eye. Blurry vision or vision loss can be associated with eye infections too, so it’s essential to pay close attention if you notice any of these signs. Causes of Eye Allergies Eye allergies can be triggered by various factors, such as seasonal allergens like pollen and grass or indoor allergens like dust mites and pet dander. Irritants such as smoke, perfume or chemicals can also cause allergic reactions in your eyes, making them feel itchy and uncomfortable. Causes of Eye Infections Eye infections, on the other hand, can arise from bacterial infections (like staphylococcus or streptococcus), viral infections (such as herpes or adenovirus) or even fungal infections (like aspergillus or candida). These types of diseases can be more severe and require immediate attention from a medical professional. Diagnosis and Treatment If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, it’s crucial to consult a professional for a proper diagnosis. At Lumen Optometric, we offer a variety of treatments to address your specific needs. For instance, our Neurolens treatment is an excellent option for those experiencing eye strain and discomfort. If your eyes are feeling chronically dry and irritated, our dry eye treatment can provide much needed relief. If you wear contact lenses, our skilled scleral optometrist can help fit you with the most comfortable lenses possible. Prevention Tips To help prevent eye allergies and infections, it’s essential to practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly. Avoid allergens and irritants as much as possible, and keep your living space clean to minimize exposure to indoor allergens. Regular eye exams and check ups are also crucial to catching any potential issues early on.

Even if your vision seems clear, getting routine eye exams is essential. Many people aren’t even aware of an eye problem until they see an eye specialist. A local scleral optometrist shares why regular eye exams matter even if you have 20 20 vision. Keep Track of Vision Changes You will never know if your vision has changed or if you need to start wearing prescription glasses until you see a specialist. Eye doctors will perform various tests to trace even the slightest changes in your vision. Regardless of age, you should schedule regular eye exams. It will ensure you have the appropriate vision correction eyewear, allowing you to see clearly and comfortably. Your eye doctor can also determine if you need dry eye treatment during your appointment. Early Detection of Vision Threatening Conditions Specialists can catch early signs of sight threatening conditions during comprehensive eye exams. Cataracts, macular degeneration and glaucoma are some eye problems that don’t manifest apparent symptoms until in their later stages. Early detection and treatment are crucial in preserving vision and delaying the progression of these eye conditions. Catch Signs of Other Health Issues Your eyes can say a lot about your overall health. It isn’t uncommon for eye doctors to detect indications of other health issues while assessing their patients’ eyes. If this is the case, they will encourage you to get further assessments from a medical practitioner. Common conditions caught during comprehensive eye exams include diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, multiple sclerosis and thyroid diseases.

We believe in helping our patients by providing them with the information that they need to safeguard their vision and eye health. We strongly suggest scheduling comprehensive eye exams every one to two years and familiarizing yourself with some of the early signs of eye conditions. In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric discusses the eye symptoms that you shouldn’t ignore. Double Vision If you experience double vision when both of your eyes are open, then it might mean that your eye muscles aren’t aligned properly. Possible causes for this condition can include serious neurological problems, so you need to take this symptom seriously. If you only have double vision in one eye, then you might have an issue related to your retina or a cataract. We recommend scheduling an appointment with us immediately so we can figure out the cause of this problem. Itching and Burning Sensation If you feel an itching and burning sensation in your eyes then you might have a condition called blepharitis. This condition is caused by bacteria or microscopic mites that live on your eyelids. Other possibilities include a painful inflammation of the eyelid’s oil gland, infections, styes, or overexposure to UV rays. As an expert in contact lenses and eye exams, we can figure out the cause of this symptom. Sudden Increase in Floaters If you experience a sudden increase in the number of floaters, then you need to see your eye doctor as soon as possible. This can indicate that the retina and blood vessels have been torn. If you also see flashes of light, then this can be a sign of retinal detachment.

For people with poor vision, eyeglasses are their windows to a clearer and more vivid world, so making sure that their glasses are well maintained and properly cared for is a high priority. If you wear glasses, there are a few things that you should keep in mind to keep your eyeglasses in an optimal condition, and corneal reshaping experts from Lumen Optometric are here to help! Wiping Don’t use wet wipes, napkins, or paper towels. These cleaning materials are made of wood pulp and have roughly textured surfaces that can scratch the lenses of your eyeglasses and can affect the coating on them too. As much as you need to, avoid using the hem or the edge of your clothes in cleaning them as well. Unless your shirt is made purely with cotton, wiping your lenses with it can cause more trouble in the long run. Microfiber cloth is the best material to use when wiping grime, dirt, and other substances off the lenses, as they are designed to do so with great care and efficiency. Handle With Care When performing maintenance and cleaning on your specs, remember to properly handle them. Take them off by holding both sides, and don’t pull them off by using one hand, as this is one of the most common causes of joint snapping for older eyeglasses. Avoid holding them by one of their frame arms, as it can bend your eyeglasses at an awkward angle and can cause fitting issues. If you’re gonna wipe the lenses, hold your eyeglasses by the bridge (the part that goes over your nose) and gently wipe the lenses in a circular motion. If taking care of eyeglasses feels like a hassle for you, you can try having contact lenses prescribed to you instead. Cleaning Solutions Using strong chemical cleaning solutions on the surface of your lenses is not a good idea, as most household cleaning fluids contain ammonia or some other form of strong acids. These can destroy and erode the protective coating over the lenses, and leave minuscule amounts of the chemical on the surface of the lenses that are facing inwards toward your eyes, which can cause irritation and discomfort, or worse, dry eye.

Let’s explore the pros and cons of glasses and contacts to help you make the best choice for your eyes and lifestyle. Advantages of Contact Lenses Contact lenses offer a clear, natural field of view without any obstructions or distortions at the edge of your vision. For those concerned with their appearance, contact lenses won’t block your face or alter your appearance, although some can change your eye color. For athletes and those leading an active lifestyle, contact lenses are the way to go as these are less likely to be dislodged. The range of options available is vast. You can choose daily disposables, weeklies or even monthlies based on your comfort level and lifestyle. Before making your decision, schedule a comprehensive eye exam to identify any specific concerns or determine whether you need to work with a scleral optometrist. Disadvantages of Contact Lenses On the flip side, contact lenses require maintenance. They need to be properly cleaned and stored, which can be time consuming. Some people may even feel discomfort or irritation, especially if they have sensitive eyes. Dry eyes can be a common issue for people considering the switch. Dry eye treatment is available and can greatly ease the transition to contact lenses. You may also want to consider a trial period with contacts before you fully commit to the switch. The risk of eye infections also increases as contacts are directly worn on the eye. On top of that, the recurring expenses for contact lenses and care products can add up, making them an expensive choice in the long run. Make the Switch With Lumen Optometric At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to discuss your options whether you are switching to contact lenses from eyeglasses or need a Neurolens treatment.

Eyesight only refers to the ability a person has to see clearly without any corrective lenses, which varies from person to person and can change over time. Meanwhile, vision is the ability to process what a person sees and it can be improved with practice. Lumen Optometric, the eye center to trust for neurolens treatment, gives more insight on how they differ from each other. Eyesight This is something that takes place in the eye. Light enters through the front of the eye and then an image is created on the retina. If the eye is not perfectly shaped, the image may not focus perfectly on the retina. When this happens, some may wear glasses or contact lenses in order to improve eyesight or clarity of what they see, or in some cases, wear special lenses prescribed by their trusted scleral optometrist. The image of what they see in their eyesight is then transferred to the brain where vision takes place. Vision This takes place in the brain. The brain receives a clear image and then the vision is the process of understanding and analyzing the image. The brain automatically filters the information and determines what information is important and ignores the rest of the information. Vision can be both consciously or subconsciously processed and is affected not only by information coming in but also by what we expect to see due to prior knowledge. How Do They Work Together? Let’s say a child is presented with a picture of a cow. Eyesight is used to see the image clearly, while vision processes what they see and recognizes what the image is. When an eye doctor tells the child that they have 20 20 vision, they’re really saying that their eyesight is fine. While this means the child can see clearly, vision still refers to recognizing the image and whether both their eyes work together to process what they see. So, if the child has never seen a cow before, their vision won’t be able to recognize what the image is.

Having myopia as a child significantly increases the risk of developing sight threatening conditions like macular degeneration,, glaucoma, and retinal detachment later in life. Even children with low levels of myopia have a greater risk of glaucoma and retinal detachment compared to their non myopic counterparts. The good news is that slowing down the progression of myopia can drastically lower the risks of developing eye disease later in life. Innovative products like MiSight 1 day contact lenses help ensure a healthier future for myopic children. As part of the Treehouse Eyes network, we are proud to be one of the first practices in the country to be certified to fit MiSight 1 day contact lenses for myopia treatment, and be part of the Brilliant Futures Program. CooperVision, which manufactures MiSight 1 day lenses, calls Brilliant Futures “the new standard of care” for children with myopia. “It provides inclusive practice, child and parent support to create the optimal environment for compliance, satisfaction, clinical outcomes and long term loyalty, all via a comprehensive management program featuring MiSight 1 day daily disposable contact lenses.” What are MiSight 1 Day Contact Lenses? MiSight 1 day contact lenses are soft lenses that are worn daily and disposed of after each use. A fresh pair of contacts are placed into the eyes every morning to provide the child with crisp and clear vision while also slowing the eye’s elongation the source of progressive myopia. These contacts are safe and easy for children to use since they require almost no maintenance. Four different clinical trials were conducted to study the safety and effectiveness of MiSight lenses over a 3 year span; 135 children between the ages of 8 12 participated in the trials. Those who wore MiSight contacts experienced considerably less myopia progression than those who wore conventional soft contact lenses. MiSight 1 Day Contact Lenses: A Popular Choice CooperVision recently partnered with Sarah Michelle Gellar, a well known American actress, entrepreneur and producer, to help spread awareness about the importance of myopia management and annual eye exams for myopic children. The need for myopia management hit home for Gellar, who is myopic herself and has a child with myopia. “My husband and I are both nearsighted and our myopia has continued to worsen over time. We want our kids to have a chance for better vision and lower their risk for future eye health issues” explains Gellar. While regular eyeglasses or contacts help children see a whiteboard or tennis ball, “MiSight 1 day lenses offer children the benefits of clear vision while slowing myopia progression during their growing years. That is why I am thrilled to be partnering with CooperVision on this campaign,” Gellar says. Moreover, many parents are pleased to learn that MiSight 1 day contact lenses are FDA approved. In November 2019, the lenses received FDA approval to slow myopia progression in children who are 8 12 years old at the time of their first fitting making MiSight 1 day contact lenses the only FDA approved soft contact lenses for myopia management! We Are Proud to Be Part of the Movement In addition to MiSight, our highly trained and experienced doctors can offer other treatment options to manage childhood myopia, including specialized overnight wear contact lenses and prescription eye drops.

GMAC, of which Treehouse Eyes is a member, invited junior racers to the go kart track for an unexpected eye exam before heading out for some fun! A recent survey of parents by the Global Myopia Awareness Coalition found \\u200b\\u200b” half of the parents reported their children spent more than four hours using electronic devices each day during the pandemic, compared to 18% of parents reporting the same behavior prior to the pandemic.” Most children don’t notice anything is wrong with their vision until it starts to really impact their activities. Eye screenings done by a pediatrician are important, but they don’t always pick up on myopia, especially at lower levels. This is why GMAC decided it was more important than ever to raise awareness of myopia and the treatments available. Watch the “Little Kid License” video now: In the same survey mentioned above, GMAC discovered that “ more than 70% of parents believe their pediatrician will flag any issues related to their children’s eyesight and, almost the same amount trust that their child would say something if they had vision issues.” Unfortunately, this is often not the case. But, why is this such an important problem to face? Myopia develops rapidly as children grow. Remember, your child’s eye grows like any other part of their body as they age. Since children are prone to growth spurts, naturally their eyes are as well. Myopia occurs when a child’s eyes grow too fast, leading to blurry distance vision and greater risk for eye diseases later in life. We know the start of the school year is insanely busy with back to school activities along with the everyday obligations of work and life, but it’s now more important than ever to find a provider that understands how to diagnose and treat your child’s myopia. Give your child the tools they need to succeed! To schedule your child’s back to school eye exam, visit book an appointment or to see a list of all providers near you visit Treehouse Eyes today.

Don’t be haunted by an eye infection. If you’d like to obtain decorative lenses for a Halloween costume, make sure to get an eye exam so your eye doctor can give the proper prescription and provide you with information about the proper contact lens cleaning and care. 2\\\\. Get A Prescription For Decorative Lenses The CDC and the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend not to purchase decorative contact lenses from costume shops, online stores, beauty salons, drug stores, flea markets, or anywhere that doesn’t require a prescription. Make sure to see a doctor to get lenses properly fitted, so your child isn’t at risk for vision problems such as eye infections and eye sores which can lead to permanent vision loss. Learn more about decorative lenses here. 3\\\\. Be Mindful Of Makeup Use Halloween makeup can be a fun way to enhance any costume, but it’s essential to not share makeup for the risk of eye infection. Practice good hygiene by taking off all makeup before bed and avoid using old, expired makeup. For eyelash extensions, it’s important to test for lash glue allergies and practice proper hygiene during application. See more about Halloween makeup safety. 4\\\\. Have Fun! Now that you’ve gotten your eye exam and your costume is complete, it’s time to go out and have fun.

Fortunately, you’re not stuck wearing such lenses, thanks to high index lenses. In today’s post, your local eye exam doctor at Lumen Optometric shares a look at high index lenses. Regular Lenses People suffering from refractive errors nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism choose to wear eyeglasses to correct their vision: it’s easier to wear than contact lenses, not as invasive or costly as an eye operation, and it can be fashionable. Eyeglasses correct refractive errors by compensating for factors such as eye length and the curvature of the cornea and lens, providing good vision. Sometimes a person’s vision may require strong eyeglass prescriptions that require thicker lenses. Most eyeglass wearers are nearsighted, which requires lenses that are thinner at the center than at the edges. The stronger the prescription, the thicker the edges will be, which can result in heavy lenses. This can limit one’s options in terms of eyewear selection, as one may need to stick to thicker frames to hold their lenses. Wearing contact lenses might not be an option for some people. High Index Lenses Many of today’s eye care centers offer high index lenses as an option. They provide the same level of refractive correction as regular lenses but are much thinner. High index lenses offer the following benefits: Thinner and lighter High index lenses have thinner edges even at high power, which opens up a wider selection of frame styles for you. Lighter lenses also make it easy to wear, even for prolonged periods. Aesthetically pleasing One reason why some people dislike wearing glasses is that high power lenses tend to look like the bottom of a soda bottle, colloquially called “Coke bottle glasses,” which makes the eyes look smaller (for nearsighted prescriptions) or larger (for farsighted prescriptions). High index lenses are “aspheric,” that is, less rounded than regular lenses, which means even high power lenses won’t distort your facial features.

January 22, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Your child’s academic performance highly depends on their sight. 80% of learning occurs through vision, meaning eye problems can hinder your little one’s ability to do well in school. Moreover, many young kids aren’t aware they have issues with their vision or don’t complain of symptoms. That’s why regular appointments with your local eye doctor matter. A local scleral optometrist shares how poor vision can affect children’s learning. Difficulty Focusing Myopia or nearsightedness is a common refractive error in children. Individuals with this eye condition can find it difficult to see distant objects. If your child is nearsighted, they might struggle to see the text on the board, which can cause them to lose focus. Their grades could suffer when they can’t concentrate on and understand their teacher’s instructions. If you’ve noticed that your child keeps squinting or holding reading materials too closely to their face, schedule a visit with your eye doctor immediately. Only eye specialists can confirm if they are nearsighted and require prescription glasses. At Lumen Optometric, we’re ready to assist with your family’s eye care needs. Aside from contact lenses and glasses, we offer dry eye treatment. Poor Reading Comprehension Vision issues can impact a child’s reading comprehension skills. The eyes must work harmoniously to move across the page, recognize letters and understand the text. It isn’t uncommon for children with vision related learning problems to get confused with similar looking letters, shapes and words because they can’t see the figures properly. Compromised Hand Eye Coordination Several studies have shown that exercise during school days can improve academic performance. If your little one doesn’t like playing outside with other kids or tends to shy away from activities that require distant vision, there’s a chance that they have problems with their sight. Your child won’t be able to enjoy the benefits of physical activity on their cognitive and motor skills if they don’t exercise during the day.

May 11, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Contact lenses are a common option for correcting refractive errors, like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. They can give you a more natural look than eyeglasses and are generally safe to wear as long as you care for them properly. Many first time wearers tend to find it challenging to put in and remove their contacts. Put in and take out your contacts easily using these helpful tips. How to Put in Your Contacts Before handling your contacts, wash and dry your hands. Failing to do so heightens the risk of eye infections and corneal ulcers from bacteria exposure. Wash your hands using soap and warm water to ensure they are clean. Moreover, avoid drying your hands with cloths or towels with lint. Go in front of a mirror and stand on a flat surface. If there’s a sink below you, make sure to plug the drain. To avoid confusion, make it a habit to put in the same lens first. Place your contacts on the tip of your index or middle finger of your dominant hand. Inspect your lenses for scratches or damaged areas. If your lens forms a blow and the edges turn up, it means it’s in the correct position. Hold your upper lid open with your non dominant hand while in front of a mirror, and hold down your lower lid with the ring finger of your dominant hand. It’s now time to put the lens in your eye, which you should do while looking at the ceiling. To allow your lens to get in place, shut your eyes and roll them in a circular motion. Open your eyes and blink a couple of times. Check your eyes in the mirror to see if the contacts are in the center of your eyes. You’ll know your lenses are in the right position if you’re comfortable and seeing clearly. If not, take out the lenses and reinsert them. Repeat the same procedure to your other eye once you’ve successfully put in the first lens. How to Take Them Out Again, make sure your hands are clean and dry before touching your contacts. Remove any leftover contact lens solution from the case and allow them to dry or dry with a clean cloth. Get in front of a mirror and gaze up. Pull your lower lid down using the middle finger of your dominant hand. It helps to take off the same lens first to save yourself from confusion. Gently push the lens down to the white of your eye using the index finger of your dominant hand. Carefully pinch the lens with your index finger’s pads and thumb to take it off your eye. Do the same procedure to remove the lens from your other eye. Need to upgrade your contact lens prescription? Lumen Optometric has options for different vision correction needs.

August 25, 2021 by Lumen Optometric There is nothing wrong with drinking alcohol occasionally or in moderation. However, too much of it can harm various parts of your body, including your eyes. It can also affect your current and future eye health and vision. Continue reading to learn how alcohol affects your eyes and vision from a local scleral optometrist. What Does Alcohol Do to Your Eyes? Moderate drinkers should expect the effects of alcohol to wear off after a while, especially if they take proper care of their bodies after drinking. After going out for drinks with your friends, make sure to drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated. It’s also important to get sufficient rest and sleep. Meanwhile, heavy drinkers are at risk of vision changes and even permanent eye damage. If you drink a lot in a single day, you may experience dizziness and blurry vision. Making heavy drinking a habit is never a good idea because there is a close correlation between the liver and the eyes. Every organ in your body is related, a reason why you should focus on your holistic health. It’s essential to get regular health checks and eye exams to keep track of your overall health. At Lumen Optometric, we offer comprehensive eye exams and dry eye treatment. Excessive Drinking and Your Vision Over time, drinking too much alcohol can cause brain damage. If your brain does not function properly, your vision may also suffer. You may have permanently blurred vision or double vision due to the weakening of eye muscles. When this happens, your reaction time may also decrease. Excessive drinking also compromises your peripheral vision and causes you to develop tunnel vision. This condition can make driving difficult because your eyes can’t react well to headlights. Another thing that alcohol can damage is your ability to distinguish contrast in colors. Moreover, too much drinking may also result in optic neuropathy, migraines, and rapid eye movements. At Lumen Optometric, we’re more than happy to assist with your eye care needs. We offer a wide range of services, including myopia management, orthokeratology, and neurolens treatment. Call us at or fill out our contact form to schedule an appointment.

Women are particularly vulnerable to cataracts due to hormonal changes. As of writing this article, the only treatment for cataracts is surgery. During cataract surgery, the doctor will remove the cloudy lens and replace them with an intraocular lens or IOL. The exact cause of cataracts may be unknown, but many experts believe that oxidative stress can damage enzymes and proteins in the eye’s natural lens. As such, the best way to reduce cataract risks is to eat a healthy diet that consists of antioxidant chemicals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Lumen Optometric, a top provider of corneal reshaping services, recommends adding these foods to your everyday menu. Fruits and Vegetables According to research, you need five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day for optimal eye health. Choose organic fruits and vegetables. When eating them as is or adding them as an ingredient for meals, leave the skins on, as they are full of vitamins A, C, and E as well as lutein and zeaxanthin. Fruits and vegetables offer the highest total antioxidant capacity, so be sure to include them in your regular meals. Fish Another way to reduce the risk of cataracts is by eating foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids. This includes seafood such as shrimp, tuna, salmon, and trout. If your eye exam doctor tells you that you are at risk for cataract development, you can slow the progression by eating fish at least twice each week. This way, you nourish your eyes and protect your vision. Whole Grains Having three servings of 100% whole grains daily is a great way to prevent cataracts. This may include amaranth, quinoa, sorghum, or millet. While these grains seem unfamiliar to you, research some recipes and add something new to your diet. In addition to that, you should also read food labels carefully. Avoid white bread and bakery items that may contain refined grains and sugars and select minimally processed items. Nuts and Seeds Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects membranes of eye cells from radical damage. A few foods, including cooking oils, seeds and nuts, are exceptionally rich sources. Preserve the health of your eyes with the help of Lumen Optometric. In addition to comprehensive eye exams, we also provide prescription glasses and contact lenses.

Blog eye care How Long Does My Child Need ?How Long Does My Child Need ? June 1, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Introduction: As parents, one of the key concerns regarding our children’s vision is understanding how long myopia management is necessary. We often wonder when myopia progression might come to a halt and whether interventions are required indefinitely. In this blog post, we’ll explore this question and shed light on the factors influencing the duration of myopia management. Understanding the Age of Myopia Stabilization: A crucial aspect of determining the duration of myopia management is identifying the age at which myopia tends to stop progressing. However, this age can vary significantly among individuals and is influenced by various factors. These factors include the age of myopia onset, the intensity of near work, parental history of myopia, and lifestyle factors. Factors Influencing Myopia Stabilization: The age of myopia onset plays a significant role in predicting when myopia is likely to stabilize. Generally, earlier onset of myopia is associated with a higher likelihood of continued progression into adulthood. Additionally, the intensity of near work, such as prolonged hours spent studying or engaging in screen activities, can impact myopia progression. Parental history of myopia also serves as a crucial indicator. Children with one or both myopic parents are at a higher risk of developing and progressing myopia. These genetic factors contribute to the overall prognosis and duration of myopia management. Understanding Ocular Growth Charts: Ocular growth charts provide valuable insights into the projected age of stabilization for myopia. However, it’s essential to recognize that these projections assume relatively stable visual and lifestyle conditions. In reality, significant changes in visual demand can trigger a second phase of myopia progression even after years of stable presentation. Conclusion: In conclusion, the duration of myopia management for your child depends on various factors, including the age of myopia onset, intensity of near work, parental history of myopia, and lifestyle factors. While ocular growth charts offer insights into the projected age of stabilization, it’s crucial to consider the dynamic nature of myopia progression, especially in response to changes in visual demand.

October 7, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Your eyeglasses or contact lenses may seem like they’re still working perfectly, but they probably aren’t if you’ve had them for a while. In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses how often you should have your eye prescription updated. How Often Should You Update Your Eye Prescription? People have different eye care needs. Some need to have their eye prescription changed annually, while others won’t need to update theirs every three years. If you’ve been keeping up with routine appointments with your eye doctor, you’d already have an idea of how often you should update your eye prescription. Some factors affect how often a person should see their eye exam doctor and have their prescription updated. For many people, age and genetics are two such factors: if you have a family member who needs to update their prescription regularly, chances are you’ll be needing the same. Lifestyle is also another factor. For example, if you have a job that requires constantly facing a screen, eye strain can affect your vision over the long term. Signs That You Need to Update Your Eye Prescription Regular visits to your eye doctor can help determine how often you should update your prescription. The pandemic has made it difficult for people to see their eye doctor, but if you haven’t had an eye exam even before the quarantines began, then you should see one as soon as possible even more so if you’re experiencing one or more of the following: You’re having frequent headaches. Pain behind or around the eyes is a warning sign that your brain is trying to compensate for the change in your vision. While resting your eyes and taking pain medication can provide temporary relief, updating your eye prescription is a better long term solution. You’re often squinting. Squinting can help focus your vision and bring clarity. However, you shouldn’t have to not with an updated eye prescription. You’re having trouble reading signs from a distance. If your daily routine includes tasks that depend on clear vision such as driving, then an outdated prescription may put you at risk.

They occur when the shape of your eye prevents light from focusing correctly on your retina, or the light sensitive tissue layer found in the back of your eye. More than five million Americans suffer from refractive errors, impacting their quality of life. But the good news is that this vision problem can be corrected. The premier optometrist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares a quick overview of different refractive error types and their treatment. 1\\\\. Myopia. Also called ‘nearsightedness’, this particular refractive error makes it hard for people to see far away objects. Myopia happens when the eye is too long in the back, or when there’s a problem with the shape of the cornea (the clear front layer of the eyes) or the lens (the inner part of the eye that helps with focusing). 2\\\\. Hyperopia. To those with hyperopia, or ‘farsightedness”, nearby objects will appear blurry. This refractive error happens when the eyeball grows too short from front to back, or when the cornea or lens has a different shape than normal. Unlike those who suffer from myopia, which may develop in patients between the ages of 6 and 14, people with hyperopia are usually born with this vision problem. 3\\\\. Astigmatism. When a person has astigmatism, they’ll have trouble seeing both far away and nearby objects clearly. This is caused by a differently shaped cornea or lens, which makes light bend differently as it enters the eye. 4\\\\. Presbyopia. This type of refractive error affects middle aged and older adults. Presbyopia is an age related vision problem that makes it hard for people to see things up close because the eye lenses have become harder and less flexible, preventing light from focusing properly on the retina. How Refractive Errors are Treated Before a refractive error can be corrected, it has to be diagnosed accurately during a comprehensive eye exam performed by a trusted eye care professional like Lumen Optometric. Once the vision problem is diagnosed, it may be corrected using prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Myopia and hyperopia may also be fixed without the benefit of eyeglasses or contacts through orthokeratology. This safe, FDA approved and non surgical treatment involves the use of custom lenses that gently reshape the eyes as you sleep. Ask us more about this particular solution and determine whether this will be a viable option for you.

Whether you have a normal eye condition or you have existing eye conditions or a risk for certain eye conditions, the following tips from Neurolens treatment specialist Lumen Optometric will surely help give you peace of mind whenever you need to drive in the evening: Night Driving Glasses If you’re having difficulty driving at night, you can ask your eye care specialist to prescribe special night driving glasses that can help you see better on the road. This type of glasses usually has a yellow tint and anti reflective coating. Also, lenses made with wavefront diagnostic technology can reduce glare, halos, starbursts and other aberrations that can distract your vision. Regular Eye Checkup Make sure to have your eyes checked by a specialist at least once every two years. If you have a significant eye condition or you have trouble with your eyes or vision, you may have to visit your eye doctor more frequently. Don’t hesitate to go for a checkup if you experience vision problems on the road at night. Your doctor may recommend that you take specialized testing, such as an evaluation of your visual field or contrast sensitivity, to determine what’s wrong and what can be done to improve your condition. Also, don’t neglect any treatments prescribed to you. If you need dry eye treatment or treatment of an eye disease, make sure to follow your doctor’s instructions. Other Tips Below are other simple ways to help ensure your safety while driving at night: Always keep your car windows clear so that you can have a good view of the road.Do not drive if you are tired or stressed. Driving requires focus. If you are already exhausted or dealing with several distractions, it would be better to have someone else drive instead.Plan your trips, especially if you will be going on a long drive. As much as possible, stick to roads that you are familiar with and avoid dark, unlighted streets and risky spots.

It does not only strengthen and improve one’s physical abilities; it can also help boost a person’s mental sharpness, emotional health, and social skills. But due to the nature of various kinds of sports, risks of injuries are always present. One example of this is the risk of eye injury. That said, it is important to have the right gear and protective eyewear to keep your eyes safe. This is true for anyone, whether you are wearing glasses or contact lenses or not. By wearing the right eye protection, you can save yourself from eye injuries such as corneal abrasion, detached retina, eye socket fracture, and hyphema. Polycarbonate lenses are usually recommended for protective sports eyewear because they are impact resistant and shatterproof. They are also thinner and lighter than plastic and provide UV protection. Make sure that the polycarbonate lenses that you use meet or exceed the current sport specific ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International standards. In this post, corneal reshaping expert Lumen Optometric shares tips on how you can protect your eyes when playing different sports. Baseball and Softball Use helmet mounted faceguards that are approved by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE). Eye guards like goggles or spectacles are also recommended to minimize injury in case of a ball impact. Sports eye guards should be approved to ASTM F803 19 or the most current standard. Football Use a faceguard with a polycarbonate visor shield. The shield will protect against objects that can potentially penetrate openings in the faceguard grid. Soccer Use sports eye guards that have ASTM F803 19 approval. Basketball Use sports eye guards like goggles or spectacles that are approved to ASTM F803 19. Field Hockey Use sports eye guards that are approved to ASTM F2713 18 or the most current standard.

A dry eye treatment specialist shares some tips here. Preparing Is the First Step The first thing you should do to incorporate good eye care into your active lifestyle is to prepare ahead of time. Get a travel pouch that fits your contacts, solution, gels, etc. Do not forget to pack eye drops that can alleviate itchiness during the hayfever season or dryness caused by heavy air conditioning. Consider Switching to Disposable Contacts Sometimes, using weekly or even monthly contact lenses does not make it easy to live your active lifestyle, especially if preparing travel kits is not your thing. If this is the case, bring up the idea of switching to contact lenses that you can dispose of daily with your optician. However, this might not be a fitting option if you use scleral or other specialty lenses, says a scleral optometrist. Bring Your Sunglasses Overexposure to ultraviolet rays can lead to a host of eye related issues like cataracts or corneal sunburn, so it is important to take the right precautions to safeguard your vision from damage. Having a pair of sunglasses with you during travels is just as essential as having all your eye care accessories. Sure, contact lenses do provide protection against UVA and UVB, but unlike sunglasses, they do not fully cover your eyes including the skin on your lids.

In today’s post, Lumen Optometric discusses what causes dry eye syndrome, and how you can manage it if it happens to you. What Is Dry Eye Syndrome? Dry eye syndrome is characterized by dryness around the eyes, which may be accompanied by irritation, inflammation, or blurred vision. Anyone can experience these symptoms, however, discomfort is more pronounced for people who wear contact lenses, as lack of moisture increases friction between the eyes and the lenses. Dryness is usually caused by hormone changes, some autoimmune conditions, or damage to the tear glands or the skin around the eyes. Advanced age and certain types of allergies may also contribute to dry eye syndrome. Some types of contact lenses, when worn for long periods, can also cause dryness in the eyes. Managing Dry Eye Syndrome If you’re experiencing symptoms of dry eye syndrome, do not take any medication or try how tos that you may find online. Visit an eye exam doctor to determine its cause and plan treatment. One of the most common treatments for dry eye syndrome is taking lubricating eye drops, which are often prescribed for dryness caused by inefficient tear glands or very low humidity levels. If dryness is determined to be caused by the medication that you’re taking, your eye doctor may require changes to your prescription. Choose the Right Contact Lenses If dryness occurs when you wear your contact lenses, you don’t have to limit its usage or switch to eyeglasses if you’re not comfortable wearing one. The following are other types of contact lenses that are more suitable for people suffering from dry eye syndrome: Soft Contact Lenses These contacts are made of hydrogel, which contains water. Soft contact lenses are typically disposable, however, some manufacturers offer extended wear options that are reusable for up to 30 days. Silicone Based Hydrogel Contact Lenses These are functionally similar to hydrogel based contact lenses, but have better moisture retention. Gas Permeable Contact Lenses These contacts are relatively more rigid, but they let oxygen reach the eye. Orthokeratology contact lenses are made from a similar material.

However, by making a few lifestyle changes, you can lower your risk for these conditions. This Healthy Aging Month, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, shares tips on taking care of your aging eyes. Eat a Balanced Diet Make sure to include in your diet foods rich in eye friendly nutrients, such as Vitamin A (which helps protect the cornea, the surface of your eye) and Vitamin E (which prevent free radicals from damaging proteins in your eyes). Should You Take Supplements? Supplements can help prevent vitamin deficiencies, but they’re not a substitute for a balanced diet. If you’re considering taking supplements, consult your eye doctor. Undergo Routine Eye Exams How often should you have your eyes checked? As a general rule, those aged 40 and above should see their eye doctor at least once a year. What many patients don’t realize is that they don’t usually notice that their vision has deteriorated unless the change is abrupt or significant. That’s because your brain automatically adapts to any changes in your vision, sometimes tricking you into thinking there’s nothing wrong with your vision even though it has already deteriorated. Through routine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect changes in your vision before they significantly affect your lifestyle and prescribe treatment. For instance, they might give you a higher prescription for your contact lenses. Wear Sunglasses Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays can damage your vision and increase your risk for conditions such as cataracts or macular degeneration. To protect your eyes from UV damage, always wear sunglasses while you’re outside. In particular, we recommend wearing sunglasses with a shade of UV 400, which provide nearly 100% protection from UV rays.

That’s why parents are doing whatever they can to help their children successfully transition to the next academic grade. Below, we share our top tips for parents, so they can ensure that their child’s vision is a tool for success in school. 1\\\\. Balance Indoor and Outdoor Time Outdoor play offers numerous benefits, but many children aren’t getting enough of it. Most children spend much of their time indoors, whether in a classroom, at home, or in after school activities. Kids who regularly play outdoors have improved motor skills, feel more independent, and practice important social skills. But the main benefit of “outdoor time” that eye doctors like to focus on is the lower incidence of myopia (where distant objects appear blurry). Numerous studies published in journals like Ophthalmic Research and Review Of Optometry have shown that children who spend 1.5 2.5 hours per day outdoors during the daytime have a reduced risk of becoming myopic or, if they have myopia, it progresses at a slower pace. Sending your kids outside to play every day will help their vision, overall health, and contribute to academic success. 2\\\\. Encourage Your Child To Take Frequent Breaks Once the new school year begins, students are often busy with daily homework, reading assignments, and visually demanding recreational activities like video games. While all of these activities are important, they shouldn’t be done without periodic breathers. Eye strain is a real concern for the many students who spend hours in front of a book or screen and can put a damper on their grades. Minimally, have your child follow the 20 20 20 rule: every 20 minutes they should focus for 20 seconds on an object that’s at least 20 feet away. Even better, encourage slightly longer breaks for a snack in the sun, or a quick walk around the block to allow their eyes to focus on more distant objects. 3\\\\. Have Their Eyes Examined by an Optometrist Whether or not your child wears glasses, yearly eye exams will help ensure healthy visual development. It’s no surprise that children who don’t see well perform at a lower level than their peers. In some cases, young children aren’t even aware that their vision has changed, or they may not be able to verbally express it. At our practice, our eye exams go far beyond the standard vision screenings offered in school. We thoroughly check your child’s eye health and several visual skills, including visual acuity, focusing, tracking and teaming. If your child has myopia we will discuss if they are a candidate for myopia management. Myopia management treatments can slow or stop myopia in children and teens and doing so will minimize their risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life. 4\\\\. Filter Out Blue Light Now, more than ever, children’s eyes are focusing on screens of all shapes and sizes. While science hasn’t yet confirmed the damaging effects of blue light on a child’s eyes, one thing is certain: blue light exposure (especially in the evening) can lead to reduced sleep quality. Good quality sleep is crucial for cognitive and physical development, which is why many parents purchase blue light glasses or utilize blue light filters such as screens and software on devices. Blue light also contributes to digital eye strain, leading to symptoms like eye pain, headaches, blurred vision and dry eyes. If your child uses a tablet, smartphone, or computer before bedtime, speak with us about whether blue light glasses or lens coatings can help. Give your child the tools they need to succeed!

Learn if glaucoma is preventable from your local orthokeratology specialist. What Is Glaucoma? Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve or the nerve in the back of the eye. Its symptoms are usually not noticeable in its early stages. People often only notice changes in their vision once the condition has progressed. The only way to confirm if you have glaucoma is to get a comprehensive eye exam. While it has no cure, early treatment can help preserve your sight. Who Are at Risk? You can get glaucoma, regardless of your ethnicity and age. However, it’s more common in people over 60, African Americans over 60, and those with a family history of glaucoma. If you are at high risk of this eye condition, you might need to see your eye exam doctor every one to two years. Is It Preventable? While glaucoma isn’t preventable, it can be caught early through regular eye exams. Early detection and treatment go a long way in preventing significant or permanent vision loss. Eating nourishing meals has also been proven to be beneficial to eye health. Include leafy greens, colored fruits, berries and vegetables in your diet. Regular exercise can lower eye pressure, which is helpful for people with glaucoma. Even low intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is ideal for glaucoma patients. Quitting smoking and wearing UV blocking sunglasses are other ways to protect your eyes from the effects of this vision threatening eye condition. If you experience sudden vision changes, don’t wait long to schedule an eye exam. At Lumen Optometric, we provide more than prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses.

July 14, 2020 by Lumen Optometric COVID 19 has changed the way people move and interact in public spaces, influencing our personal hygiene and habits. For contact lens wearers, the “new normal” has put a question on their use of contacts. While contact lenses are generally a safe and effective form of vision correction for many people, concerns have grown as to whether it’s OK to continue using these lenses or not amid the pandemic. Since contact lenses are inserted and removed using one’s fingers, wouldn’t this pose a higher risk of coronavirus infection? According to recent research, there is no sufficient evidence suggesting that contact lens wearers have a higher risk of contracting COVID 19. Experts have also emphasized the importance of proper handwashing and good hygiene in order to prevent or reduce such risks. Lumen Optometric, a trusted expert in eye care and dry eye treatment, shares more tips below. Observe Proper Handwashing Before handling your contact lenses, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Afterwards, dry your hands with a clean towel or unused paper towels. If soap and water are not available, you can use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% of alcohol. Regularly Disinfect Contact Lenses Your scleral optometrist will also likely advise you to regularly disinfect your contacts if they are monthly or two week lenses. Make sure to follow the cleaning instructions of the manufacturer or your eye doctor. If you have disposable lenses, get rid of them properly every after use. Discontinue Wearing Contacts and Switch to Glasses if Sick If you are experiencing any COVID 19 symptoms or you have tested positive for COVID 19, it would be best to stop using your contacts and switch to glasses for the meantime. Take note, however, that wearing glasses cannot protect you against COVID 19 or prevent transmissions of the virus. Lumen Optometric is a local practice that offers top notch eye care services.

A myopic eye is one that grows too long front to back. We know this because we measure it using special equipment that calculates the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length, and with advanced equipment we can now measure this down to fractions of a millimeter. So myopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye – if a normal eye is shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye would more resemble a football. Portrait of boy working on team project in art class Once an eye is too long, there are currently no known treatments or cures which can cause the axial length of the eye to reverse. Refractive surgery performed on adults, such as LASIK, does not “shrink” the eye, but rather reshapes the front surface of the cornea to enable clear vision without corrective lenses. While the patient who has successful refractive surgery can now see clearly, they still have an elongated eye, so still have the risks associated with the disease. The Dangers of Having Myopia There are different types of myopia as well. If a child develops myopia at a young age, we know that they are at higher risk to develop high myopia and even pathological levels of myopia. High levels of myopia can lead to an increased risk for diseases of the eye such as retinal detachments, glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy. Unfortunately, those diseases can all lead to permanent vision loss. These life altering diseases are another layer of danger besides the obvious need for optical correction in glasses or contact lenses in order to see clearly. When you have pathological or degenerative myopia, other signs can form on your eyes that your eye doctor needs to monitor over time. Lattice degeneration and lacquer cracks of the retina all show signs that the retina is under duress because the eyeball has grown excessively long. Ask your doctor about these signs and other ones such as a tilted optic nerve head disc and choroidal neovascularization that happen exponentially higher in cases of extremely high levels of myopia. What are the Best Ways to Treat Myopia? The best treatment is to first prevent myopia if possible. More research is being conducted in this area, but as a general rule, eye doctors are encouraging at least two hours of outdoor activity per day. More outdoor activities under natural sunlight have been associated with a lower risk of developing myopia in the first place. If your children have to do intense studying or reading, it is recommended to do as much reading as possible when the sun has set versus reading during the day. Regular checkups with your eye doctor to diagnose myopia as early as possible are also critical. By catching myopia at an early age, there can be many different types of interventions to prevent myopia from worsening. Myopia typically begins in school aged children and can worsen until the leveling out usually in your mid twenties. As far as the visual component is concerned, usually, a pair of glasses or contact lenses are sufficient. Once the eyes have stopped growing, refractive surgery procedures can be employed as well. But keep in mind that simply correcting your vision will not stop your eyes from getting worse. The root cause of myopia, an eyeball that continues to grow excessively long during our youth, needs to be addressed. Special pharmaceutical agents such as atropine have been shown to slow down the progression of myopia considerably. Special contacts such as orthokeratology lenses worn at night are effective as well. Even soft contact lenses and glasses designed with special optics different from the traditional pair of glasses can be effective to slow down the rate of myopic progression. Custom Orthokeratology or Overnight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed contact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while sleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names for orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping system, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the curvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While initially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see more clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in reducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused in front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the optical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact lenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning and disinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper hygiene ‘ortho k’ is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating children of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that can be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to treat children with amblyopia, sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic progression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are being designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight contact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia by almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers throughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral retina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact lens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia as well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating Eyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a similar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is a particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact lenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s bodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of power in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial length elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids just like yours so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above are four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been diagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with a contact lens while sleeping.

January 1, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Routine visits to the eye doctor are necessary for maintaining the good health of your eyes. If you feel that there is something wrong with your vision or experiencing discomfort in your eyes, you must consult a specialist immediately. You can either go to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist if you have issues with your eyes. Read on to discover which eye exam doctor you should visit for your eye condition. Optometrists VS Ophthalmologists An optometrist attends optometry school for four years and usually do a year of residency. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist goes to medical school for four years and does a four year residency. Also, an ophthalmologist typically does a fellowship for one to two years. They can choose a specialty like glaucoma or pediatrics. Ophthalmologists will have an MD or DO following their name while optometrists will have an OD after their names. Who Should You Go To? Both optometrists and ophthalmologists can prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses. The main difference between the two professions is that an ophthalmologist performs surgeries while optometrists don’t. Ophthalmologists are surgeons who can also treat eye diseases. States may indicate which conditions optometrists can treat while ophthalmologists can treat all eye diseases. For eye exams and prescriptions, you can go to both eye doctors. Usually, an optometrist is the better option for those who need more contacts. On the other hand, those who need surgeries should consult an ophthalmologist. It’s the same for serious conditions like macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. For your eye care needs, you can depend on Lumen Optometric.

Both organizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia, and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life. What is Myopia? Myopia causes blurry distance vision, which can be compensated for with glasses or contact lenses to provide a child with clear vision. However, myopia is caused by an eye that is growing too long and, once started, myopia usually gets worse in children as the eye continues to grow abnormally fast. Higher myopia increases the lifetime risk of serious eye diseases such as retinal diseases and glaucoma. How Bad is the Myopia epidemic? In late 2019, the American Academy of Ophthalmology created a Task Force on Myopia, recognizing the importance of this growing disease in children and the potential lifelong impact myopia has on individuals and society. This task force identified priorities of educating other physicians, working with government agencies and health agencies, and educating parents and schools about this issue so that more proactive steps can be taken to help children. Treehouse Eyes Co founder, Matt Oerding, was recently interviewed about the prevalence of myopia alongside Dr. William Reynolds of the American Optometric Association and Dr. Emily McCourt, the chief of ophthalmology at Children’s Hospital Colorado.” Over the last two decades, there’s been an increase in myopia or nearsightedness worldwide, not just in the United States. And that corresponds with an increase in near devices, especially digital devices,” Reynolds said. Watch the full interview by clicking here. Myopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050. Can Myopia be Stopped? There is hope for parents, however, as several treatments are now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good candidate for treatment.

It’s estimated that the 700,000 workplace eye injuries that happen every year cost businesses roughly $934 million in combined productivity loss, health costs, fines, and employee compensation. That’s why employers are being encouraged to promote vision health among their employees this Workplace Eye Wellness Month. Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, shares eye care tips below: Remind Employees to Observe the 20 20 20 Rule While using a computer, you should take short breaks to allow your eye muscles to rest. Every 20 minutes, employees should look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Avoid Sitting Too Close to the Computer Screen A common myth is that you can develop myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) if you sit too close to the screen. However, this myth has been debunked by the fact the two vision conditions have strong genetic links. While sitting close to the screen won’t cause nearsightedness or farsightedness, it can increase digital eye strain. To prevent digital eye strain, the computer screen should be about 20 to 28 inches away from the face. However, if employees keep moving closer to the screen to see better, they should see an eye specialist as soon as possible. That’s because they may need a higher prescription for their eyeglasses or contact lenses. Adjust the Computer’s Display Settings Another way to reduce digital eye strain is to adjust the computer’s display settings to make it easier for your eyes to follow the text and see images. Adjust the computer display’s brightness to the same level as your workplace’s brightness, enlarge the font size for easier viewing, and reduce the color temperature to reduce the blue light the short wavelength visible light associated with increased eye strain emitted. Alternatively, employees can also wear computer glasses, which have yellow tinted lenses that block blue light. For more tips on reducing your exposure to blue light, consult your local eye doctor.

Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, with the symptom being blurry distance vision. Studies show that myopia rates in children are increasing as kids spend less time outdoors and more time involved in near work like digital device use. What many parents don’t know is that rapidly progressing myopia is more than just a hassle it can harm your child’s eye health. Children with progressive myopia are far more likely to develop potentially sight threatening eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration later in life. Given the growing prevalence of myopia in children the media are taking notice. There have been a number of articles recently about this issue in the New York Times, Women Fitness and more locally here in Bay Area Moms and Macaroni Kid. These articles have great tips for parents. We recommended kids get outside at least 2 3 hours a day and take frequent breaks from screen use to help their vision. We also offer new myopia treatments, including customized contact lenses and prescription eye drops, that we can use to treat myopia. Our practice specializes in providing these treatments and offers myopia consultations to customize a treatment plan for each child. What Causes Myopia to Progress? Genetics play a large role in myopia development. Two nearsighted parents are more likely to have a myopic child than a couple with only one myopic parent, or no myopic parents at all. No one knows exactly why myopia progresses, but spending most of the day indoors, focusing on near objects like screens and books, may be risk factors. More research is needed to determine whether the fact that children are spending less time looking at faraway objects like a moving baseball or a basketball net might be contributing to the increase in myopia cases around the world. How Can I Prevent Myopia From Worsening? One of the best pieces of advice for parents of nearsighted children is to increase their child’s outdoor playtime in the sun. In research studies, the progression of myopia was slower in children who spent a considerable amount of time in the sunshine than in children who did not. The World Health Organization advises that children under 5 spend 1 hour or less per day in front of a screen, and no screen time is recommended for infants under 1. The Children’s Eye Foundation recommends outdoor play daily, and no screen time for children under 2. They also recommend no more than 1 2 hours per day for 2 to 5 year olds, with frequent breaks. How Can a Eye Doctor Help? Myopia management eye doctors do more than prescribe corrective lenses. Although no actual cure for myopia exists, there are methods that can help control its progression. Like most treatments, myopia treatment in children is most effective when started early before a child is highly myopic.

When it comes to their vision, early detection of issues like nearsightedness (myopia) is crucial for timely intervention and effective management. Myopia can impact a child’s academic performance, social interactions, and overall quality of life if left unaddressed. In this article, we’ll highlight key signs that parents should watch for to identify if their child may be experiencing nearsightedness. Frequent Squinting: One of the most common signs of nearsightedness in children is squinting. If you notice your child squinting often, especially when trying to see distant objects like road signs or the whiteboard at school, it could indicate that they are having difficulty focusing on distant objects. Sitting Close to the TV or Holding Devices Close: Children with nearsightedness may instinctively sit closer to the television or hold digital devices closer to their face to see more clearly. While occasional closeness to screens is common, persistent behavior of this nature could be a red flag for myopia. Complaints of Headaches or Eye Strain: Children experiencing nearsightedness may complain of frequent headaches or eye strain, particularly after engaging in activities that require focusing on distant objects for extended periods, such as reading or watching movies in a theater. Difficulty Seeing the Whiteboard or Screen at School: If your child consistently has difficulty seeing the whiteboard or screen in the classroom, despite sitting in the front rows, it could indicate nearsightedness. They may also struggle to recognize faces or objects from a distance. Rubbing Eyes Frequently: Excessive rubbing of the eyes can be a sign of eye fatigue or strain, which often accompanies nearsightedness. If you observe your child rubbing their eyes frequently, especially after engaging in activities that require visual concentration, it’s worth investigating further. Decline in Academic Performance: Unexplained declines in academic performance, particularly in subjects that require visual acuity like reading or math, may be attributed to undiagnosed nearsightedness. If your child’s grades suddenly drop or they express frustration with schoolwork, consider scheduling an eye exam. Family History of Myopia: Genetics play a significant role in the development of myopia. If one or both parents have myopia, there’s an increased likelihood that their children will also develop the condition. Keep this in mind and remain vigilant for signs of nearsightedness in your child, especially if there’s a family history. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia: Recognizing the signs of nearsightedness in your child early on is essential for proactive intervention and effective management. If you observe any of the aforementioned signs or have concerns about your child’s vision, don’t hesitate to schedule an myopia consultation with a Treehouse Eyes provider. Remember, addressing vision issues promptly can significantly impact your child’s overall well being and success in various aspects of life. Let’s work together to ensure our children’s vision remains clear for a bright future ahead.

It can help you sleep better by regulating your circadian rhythm. Studies show that daily and healthy exposure to sunlight can benefit the eyes of little ones. A local scleral optometrist explains why safe sun exposure is great for your children’s eyes. Sunlight and Your Kids’ Eyes Myopia or nearsightedness happens when the shape of the eye is too curved, keeping light from properly focusing on the retina. People who have it struggle to see distant objects. When not detected and treated early, it can affect a child’s performance in school and at play. Have you noticed that your child blinks or squints a lot? Do they often complain of headaches or that they can’t see the words on the board at school? If so, it’s best to schedule a visit with your local optometrist. These are typical signs of nearsightedness in children. At Lumen Optometric, we are here for your family’s vision correction and dry eye treatment needs. Moreover, research shows that children who spend time outdoors are less likely to develop this vision condition. Experts believe bright sunlight can aid in the retina’s production of dopamine, a hormone that can help regulate eye growth. Tips for Healthy Sun Exposure While natural light might benefit your child’s eyes, you should discourage them from looking directly at the sun. Like adults, they need to wear UV blocking sunglasses to keep their eyes safe from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. Even when it’s cloudy outside, you and your child should apply sunscreen and wear sunglasses. Wearing a wide brimmed hat can also reduce the UV rays that reach your little one’s eyes. Then, limit their time outdoors during the sun’s peak hours, which is from midday to early afternoon. Routine eye exams can help you keep track of your family’s vision and eye health.

It affects the cornea, or the clear layer that covers your eye’s iris and protects the pupil. Lumen Optometric discusses its causes, symptoms, and treatment. What Causes a Scratched Cornea? Anything that comes into contact with the clear surface of your eyes can lead to a corneal abrasion. Rubbing your eyes too hard can cause a scratched cornea, as well as a grain of dust or sand getting lodged on the front of your eye. Wearing contact lenses longer than is recommended and poking your eye accidentally can also lead to this type of eye injury. The risk of a scratched cornea increases when you experience dry eye syndrome. Being diagnosed with this condition makes it hard for you to sleep, since the eyelids may stick to the cornea. Upon waking up, your eyelids may tear a part of your cornea, resulting in a scratch or abrasion. What Are the Symptoms of a Scratched Cornea? Any eye injury, including a corneal abrasion, must be examined by your eye doctor. Visit them right away if you start experiencing any of these symptoms: Blurry vision.Eye pain that doesn’t resolve in minutes or hours.Feeling that something’s stuck in your eye.Foreign matter lodged in front of your eyes like dirt or small particles.Light sensitivity How Is Corneal Abrasion Treated? Before you visit your eye doctor, consider reducing the symptoms and the risk of infection. You can rinse the affected eye with saline solution to dislodge specks of dust or dirt. Try blinking several times as well to move the small particles from the cornea to the eyelashes. Your eye doctor will examine the affected eye and remove any objects they may find. To minimize discomfort during this prescription, they’ll apply anesthetic eye drops. They may prescribe you with eye drops to keep the eye lubricated and minimize infection and inflammation, as well as oral medication if you feel pain or light sensitivity. The healing time varies depending on how small or large the corneal abrasion is. Turn to Lumen Optometric for your immediate and ongoing optic needs.

They might experience difficulty seeing in dimly lit areas. As you age, your risk of developing certain eye conditions also increases. These are among the many reasons seniors should see their eye doctor regularly. Learn more about the importance of senior eye care from a local scleral optometrist. Why Is Senior Eye Care Important? Individuals over 60 are more prone to eye diseases that can lead to irreversible vision changes. Many of these conditions do not manifest symptoms until they are in their later stages. Some of the most usual age related eye problems include cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Dry eye and retinal detachment are also common in seniors. Moreover, their early detection and treatment are crucial to preserve vision and improve quality of life. Quick Eye Care Tips for Seniors Schedule Routine Eye Exams Regardless of age, you must see your eye doctor regularly. Routine comprehensive eye exams can detect eye problems in their initial stages. Early treatment of vision threatening conditions is essential to preserving vision. Also, only an eye care specialist can trace changes in your vision. They can determine if you need dry eye treatment or new prescription eyewear. Make Indoor Spaces More Accessible Good lighting can enhance the safety of your living space. Place nightlights in hallways, bedrooms and hallways to reduce the likelihood of falling or tripping. To make rooms easier to navigate, consider having furnishings, walls and flooring in contrasting colors. For instance, light colored countertops make dark colored items easier to see. Eat Nourishing Meals Leafy greens, nuts, oily fish and citrus fruits are beneficial to eye health. Eat foods rich in zinc, omega 3 fatty acids, carotenoids, and vitamins A, C, and E. Meanwhile, minimize your consumption of foods high in saturated fats, sodium and sugar. Exercise Regularly Daily movement can improve blood circulation in your eyes. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight, lowering your risk of diabetes. Walking, stretching and yoga are gentler exercises seniors can try.

Blog eye care Should You Go for Daily or Monthly Contact Lenses?Should You Go for Daily or Monthly Contact Lenses? October 2, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Cutting corners is never an option when it comes to proper eye care. As such, you’ll want to know which type of contact lenses best suit your needs and preferences, so it does its job while not getting in the way of your daily routine. However, with so many specific choices available, it can be a bit overwhelming to work out which type of lenses are best for your use. To help you determine your most preferred type of contact lenses, corneal reshaping expert Lumen Optometric has put together a quick comparison between daily and monthly contact lenses, and which is most ideal for your daily use. Daily Contact Lenses Also known as daily disposables, they come ready to insert in individual blister packs for one day use. When the day’s done and you’re about to sleep in for the night, just dispose of your lenses in the trash. When you wake up, you open another blister pack for a new pair. You don’t need to worry about cleaning or storing the lenses each time you use daily contact lenses since they’re disposable. They’re also generally very thin and have a high water content, and if you remove these contacts during the day for any reason, you’ll need to replace them with a fresh new pair. Monthly Contact Lenses These lenses are thicker and more durable than daily lenses because they have to resist drying out while you store and use them for 30 days. When you aren’t wearing them, you can store the contact lenses in a small two sided container with some contact solution. When using monthly contact lenses, you need to clean them to avoid infections and protein buildup. There are various contact solutions you can use to clean monthly lenses, and you should only use the ones recommended by your eye doctor. This is because different brands and types of solutions that use different chemicals can be incompatible and even destroy a contact they’re not designed for. Which is More Ideal for Your Use? The type of contact lenses you’ll use can actually depend on what your trusted eye doctor prescribes you. Your prescription might determine whether you choose monthly or daily contact lenses, but not all types of contacts are available for every prescription. For instance, if you need multifocal lenses, some are only available as monthlies. But if your prescription allows you to use both daily and monthly lenses, then you can consider which is better for your lifestyle. If your lifestyle makes it likely that something may get in your eye, then having daily disposables means you can just take out the lens and throw it out so you won’t have to bother with trying to clean the contact of any contaminants. This is especially handy if you work outdoors or don’t have easy access to facilities to clean and store your contact lenses. But if you have a controlled lifestyle and always have access to a washroom and mirror to remove and clean your lenses if needed, then monthlies could work better for your daily use.

Overexposure to the sun, particularly its UV rays, can damage your eyes too. This eye condition is called photokeratitis or ultraviolet keratitis. Your trusted eye exam doctor at Lumen Optometric lists the symptoms of photokeratitis and what you can do to treat your sunburned eyes. Symptoms of Sunburned Eyes It can be hard to tell when your eyes are already being overexposed to the sun. But if your eyes hurt whenever you look at an area near the sun, it’s usually an indication that your eyes have been overexposed to UV rays. Apart from this, you may also experience the following symptoms: eye painlight sensitivityblurry visionredness or discomfort in the eyesseeing haloseyelid twitchingheadachegritty feeling in the eyestemporary loss of vision These symptoms can last for one or two days.

How to Treat Sunburned Eyes Photokeratitis usually resolves on its own within a couple of days, so its treatment is mainly focused on reducing discomfort from the symptoms. During this time, make sure to rest your eyes and remove your contact lenses. This will help your eyes heal more quickly. You can also ask your doctor if they will recommend pain relievers or antibiotic eye drops. Below are some other at home remedies that you can try: Close your eyes and place cool compress over them.Don’t rub your eyes as this will only cause further irritation.Lubricate your eyes with artificial tears.

AMD typically occurs as aging causes damage to the macula, a part of the retina that controls sharp vision. While it does not cause total blindness, AMD makes it harder for people to perform their daily routines, such as reading, driving, or doing any close up work. In this article, Lumen Optometric, known for high quality eyeglasses and contact lenses, explains everything you need to know about AMD. What Are the Different Types and Symptoms of AMD? There are two types of AMD: dry and wet. Dry AMD, also called atrophic AMD, occurs when the macula gets thinner and progresses slowly over many years. It also has three stages: early, intermediate, and late. During the early and intermediate dry AMD stage, some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience mild blurriness in their central vision. On the other hand, wet AMD, also called advanced neovascular AMD, is a less common type of late AMD. It happens when abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, which eventually causes damage to the macula. As such, wet AMD causes faster vision loss. It’s important to note that any stage of dry AMD can turn into wet AMD, but wet AMD is always late. People with late AMD may notice straight lines looking wavy or crooked. They may also see a blurry area near the center of their vision, which may get bigger as time goes by. Some people report seeing blank spots or having trouble seeing in low lighting. If you experience any of these symptoms, be sure to see an optometrist immediately. How Do Doctors Diagnose AMD? One effective way to check if you have AMD is through an eye exam. Your eye exam doctor may also perform any of the following procedures to diagnose AMD successfully: Distance and near vision acuity testsDilated eye examination (which also includes using an ophthalmoscope) The pupil of your eye is dilated to allow your doctor to observe your macula at the inside back wall of the eye.Optical coherence tomography testing (OCT) To gain a clearer picture of your macula and its supporting layers, OCT generates high quality images of the eye.

It affects all of the systems of the body, including the eyes. The decrease in estrogen levels can alter one’s eyesight. Even the shape of the eyes undergoes a slight change, making it hard for women to wear contact lenses comfortably. Eye Conditions Associated With Menopause The following are some of the most common eye conditions that affect women during menopause: Dry Eyes – Women over the age of 50 have been shown to be at high risk of developing symptoms of dry eye syndrome such as blurred vision, light sensitivity and swollen or reddened eyelids. The decrease in hormone levels can also lower the salinity of the inner tear film and the oils of the outer tear film. Cataracts – Decreased hormone levels can also increase the risk for cataracts. Common signs and symptoms include seeing fading colors and halos around light sources and having difficulty seeing at night. Scheduling regular visits to your eye exam doctor can help detect this condition early. Glaucoma – This eye condition is also common in menopausal women. It leads to the damage of the optic nerve, usually from increased eye pressure. Early detection and treatment can help protect the eyes from vision loss associated with glaucoma. Eye Care During Menopause Taking a proactive approach is the best way to preserve your vision during your menopause years. In addition to annual eye exams, your eye doctor may recommend hormone therapy to restore your estrogen levels. While it may help reduce the risk of developing these eye conditions, patients who undergo such are four to seven times more likely to develop dry eye symptoms. Other ways to control menopause symptoms include a more natural approach like taking herbal supplements and consuming a diet rich in Vitamin D. Lifestyle changes can also help reduce dry eye symptoms like removing drafts and wearing wraparound sunglasses outdoors.

We will be discussing the four best ways to treat your myopia so it no longer gets worse. Everything we discuss is based on solid science and research, double masked clinical trials, and recommendations based on mountains of peer reviewed data. Certainly, we’ve heard and researched other more holistic approaches, if they turn out to be effective, know that this is surely a growing field however and as things change you’ll certainly hear it from us first! What is Myopia? Before you can defeat your enemy, you need to know exactly what it is. Myopia is a disease of the eye that is usually the result of an eyeball that has grown too long. We call how long the eyeball is the ‘axial length’. When the axial length grows excessively long, your vision will suffer in direct correlation. So any treatment we discuss has to show efficacy in its ability to reduce axial length elongation compared to a control group. Other times, the cornea may be too steep which can also cause myopia. However, for the sake of this article, we will address the major cause of myopia which is the excessive axial length of the eye. As when we talk about managing myopia, we will be talking about ways that have shown clinical evidence in slowing down axial length growth. Custom Orthokeratology or Overnight Contact Lenses Orthokeratology involves using a specially designed contact lens to gently reshape the cornea. The lenses are worn only while sleeping and are removed upon awakening in the morning. There are other names for orthokeratology such as corneal reshaping treatment, gentle vision shaping system, and custom retainers. The technology works by gently flattening the curvature of the cornea to redirect light directly onto the retina. While initially created to help improve vision so that children and adults can see more clearly, studies have shown that the technology is extremely effective in reducing the rate of myopia progression. The theory is that light is focused in front of the retina in your peripheral vision. This effect changes the optical signals the eye receives to stimulate eye growth. Like all contact lenses, patients need to be diligent in handwashing and cleaning, and disinfecting the lenses for safe use. However, studies show that with proper hygiene this is an incredibly safe and effective treatment for treating children of almost any age. Atropine Atropine is a pharmaceutical agent that can be made into an eye drop. This eye drop has been used for many years to treat children with amblyopia, or sometimes called a ‘lazy eye’. It can be used to dilate the pupils of the eye and also used to treat uveitis as well. What we’ve learned as well is that the use of a diluted concentration of atropine can also slow down the speed of myopia progression. The mechanism of action is still little known, but we believe that it blocks certain signals of the eye to reduce the signal to grow longer. By slowing down the speed at which the axial length increases, this can directly impact the rate of myopic progression. Custom Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses More contact lenses are being designed and FDA approved to slow down myopic progression. The MiSight contact lens is an example that has been shown to slow down the rate of myopia by almost 60% compared to control groups. These lenses have different powers throughout the lens that optically focuses light in front of the peripheral retina. By designing these special powers, a patient can wear a simple contact lens during the day to treat both the vision problems associated with myopia as well as prevent the eye from growing too long. Special Myopia Treating Eyeglasses More glasses are coming out that can also redirect light in a similar fashion to orthokeratology and soft multifocal contact lenses. This is a particularly exciting alternative for patients who cannot tolerate contact lenses and are wary of putting pharmaceutical drugs into their children’s bodies. From large bifocal eyeglasses to lenses with specialized rings of power in them, lenses are becoming more and more advanced to prevent axial length elongation. Treehouse Eyes Can Help Prevent Myopia Progression The good news is we help prevent or slow down myopia progression in kids just like yours so they can have their best shot at academic and social success! Above are four of the best ways we treat myopic progression once your child has been diagnosed with myopia. Orthokeratology involves reshaping the eye gently with a contact lens while sleeping. Atropine involves an eye drop that can signal the eye to grow a little slower. Custom soft multifocal lenses are worn during the day. And even specially designed glasses are on the horizon to improve the progression of myopia.

But with so many of these conditions identified by the medical community, it can be hard to list down all of their possible effects on the eyes. Understanding the risk your specific autoimmune disorder poses to your vision is key to ensuring optimal eye health. Consult your eye doctor immediately if you start experiencing eyesight problems. In this blog, Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye care center for neurolens® treatment, shares some of the autoimmune disorders that affect the eyes. Lupus It is a type of autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body, including the eyes. It can lead to eye related conditions like retinal vascular lesions and optic neuropathy. Symptoms may include blurred vision, sore or dry eyes, and light sensitivity. Rheumatoid Arthritis It is a chronic multisystem disease with musculoskeletal manifestations. While it primarily targets the hands, arms, legs and feet, this inflammatory disorder can also affect the eyes. Dry eye syndrome, however, is the most common eye condition to accompany rheumatoid arthritis. A visit to an eye doctor can help determine necessary dry eye treatment to alleviate discomfort. Other eye related conditions associated with rheumatoid arthritis include scleritis (inflammation of the white part of the eye) and uveitis (inflammation of the tissues in the eyewall). Multiple Sclerosis This autoimmune disorder affects the central nervous system. Given that the optic nerve is directly connected to it, an individual may be diagnosed with MS after the development of initial symptoms of vision problems. Optic neuritis, for instance, can bring a combination of color vision loss, blurred vision and double vision that usually affects only one eye.

Seeking a comprehensive eye examination after a concussion is crucial for several reasons, including the detection and management of vision problems that may arise as a result of the head injury. Continue reading as a trusted eye exam doctor further discusses the importance of having your eyes checked post concussion. Visual Disturbances and Concussions Concussions can lead to a range of visual disturbances, such as blurred vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia) and difficulty focusing. These symptoms may not be immediately apparent but can manifest in the days or weeks following the injury. A post concussion eye exam helps identify and address these issues, promoting a more effective recovery. Detecting Ocular Motor Dysfunction Concussions often affect the coordination of eye movements, known as ocular motor function. This can result in difficulties with tracking objects, maintaining focus or experiencing eye strain. A specialized eye examination can pinpoint ocular motor dysfunction, guiding the implementation of targeted therapies to improve eye coordination and alleviate associated symptoms. Assessing Binocular Vision Problems Binocular vision problems, where the eyes struggle to work together seamlessly, are common after concussions. This can lead to double vision, depth perception challenges and discomfort. Through a comprehensive check, an eye doctor can assess binocular vision problems and recommend appropriate interventions, such as vision therapy or corrective lenses. Addressing Light Sensitivity Photophobia is a frequent symptom post concussion. Exposure to light can exacerbate headaches and discomfort, whether you’re wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses. Optometrists can evaluate the extent of light sensitivity during an eye exam and recommend strategies to manage it effectively. This may include specialized lenses or advice on controlling lighting environments.

But regular eye tests are not just about getting an occasional check up when things seem “off.” Instead, yearly eye tests are essential to catch any potential issues early and ensure optimal eye health. Why Eyesight Is Crucial for Education Eye health can deeply affect your child’s academic progress. In fact, roughly 80% of learning during a child’s first 12 years involves the use of the eyes. Vision problems may inevitably lead to challenges in reading, writing and even social activities. The Eye as a Health Indicator Beyond vision, an eye exam can be a window to your child’s overall health. Vision problems can hint at other health issues, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. In some cases, an eye exam can be the first step in diagnosing such conditions. The Benefits of Early Detection As with most health problems, catching eye issues early makes a big difference. For instance, certain corrective measures work best when started early. Identifying eye concerns early helps avoid potential complications and ensures your child’s vision is not adversely impacted. Why a Yearly Exam Is Necessary Regular eye exams are vital in monitoring vision changes and intervening promptly when necessary. While basic screenings in school can help flag significant problems, they don’t compare to a comprehensive exam by a professional optometrist. They go beyond reading charts to examine the eye’s health and ensure anomalies are treated before they become more serious. Schedule Your Child’s Eye Exam at Lumen Optometric Annual eye exams for kids offer a way to safeguard their academic success, ensure their eyes are developing as they should, and even act as a preventive health measure.

(While staring at a computer screen, you tend to blink less often. This increases the risk of dry eye because blinking is how a tear film which helps keep your eyes moist is spread across the surface of your eye.) However, recent studies have shown that having diabetes mellitus increases your risk for dry eyes. Lumen Optometric, your trusted eye exam doctor, explains how diabetes and dry eyes are connected and elaborate on the possible treatment options below: How Diabetes and Dry Eyes Are Connected Some medical researchers believe diabetic neuropathy can explain the connection between diabetes and dry eyes. Neuropathy happens when some of the nerves are damaged. It’s also a risk factor for lacrimal gland dysfunction. If the lacrimal gland (which secretes the watery component of the tear film) is damaged, tear production decreases. This, in turn, increases a patient’s risk for dry eyes. Important: Diabetes is just one of several factors that can increase your risk for dry eyes. Other factors include age (it’s not uncommon for people aged over 65 to experience dry eyes) and environmental conditions (tears evaporate more quickly in dry climates). If you have any of the aforementioned risk factors, you should undergo an eye exam at least once a year. Through routine eye exams, your eye doctor can detect and treat eye conditions before they progress or give higher prescriptions for contact lenses before blurry vision interferes with your daily routines. How Are Dry Eyes Treated Your eye doctor may recommend the following treatment options: Artificial tears – To alleviate the symptoms of mild or moderate dry eyes, you may need to apply artificial tears several times during the day. Eye inserts – An eye insert resembles a grain of rice and releases lubrication as it dissolves. It is placed between your lower eyelid and your eyeball. To learn more about your treatment options, consult your local eye doctor. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including corneal reshaping services.

Since their early invention, contact lenses have progressed a long way, transitioning from glass to hard plastic and finally to the soft materials we use today. In this blog post, we’ll delve into how exactly contact lenses are made and how manufacturers have revolutionized the way they are produced by harnessing modern technology and materials. The Foundation: Materials and Molding The journey begins with selecting the base material. Soft contact lenses are typically made from hydrogel or silicone hydrogel, which are chosen for their oxygen permeability and biocompatibility. These materials allow your eyes to breathe, which is essential for healthy wear. Rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, on the other hand, prioritize oxygen permeability even further. They are primarily made from highly durable and breathable plastics like fluoropolymers combined with silicone. Once the material is chosen, the lenses undergo a molding process to achieve their final shape. Here’s where the methods differ. Soft Contact Lenses Soft contact lenses are made through spin casting or lathe cutting process. Spin casting involves depositing liquid plastic into molds and then spinning them until the plastic takes the desired shape. Lathe cutting, meanwhile, involves carving the plastic into lens form. Computer controlled tools meticulously sculpt the lens from a disc of material. Both methods lead to polishing for comfort and hydration before reaching your eyes. Rigid Gas Permeable Lenses RGP lenses prioritize oxygen permeability, which is crucial for healthy corneal function. Their shaping process utilizes lathe cutting, which offers greater precision for intricate designs. It meticulously sculpts the lens design from the disc, similar to a woodworking lathe but with incredible accuracy. This allows for intricate shapes and sharper edges. RGP lenses can have complex curves and features to address specific vision needs, like astigmatism. Lathe cutting enables these intricate geometries. Additionally, precise cutting ensures clean and sharp edges on the lens, which is necessary for optimal tear flow and lens stability in the eye. Shaping and Finishing Touches Following the molding stage, both soft and RGP lenses undergo additional processes to ensure comfort and clarity. Polishing: Lenses are polished to achieve a smooth and comfortable surface for wearers. This step is essential for both soft and RGP lenses to minimize irritation. Hydration (Soft Lenses Only): Soft contact lenses are bathed in a sterile solution to absorb water and achieve their characteristic flexibility. This step is not required for RGP lenses. Quality Control and Packaging Every lens, soft or RGP, undergoes rigorous inspection for any defects or imperfections. This enables your scleral optometrist to provide you with only the highest quality lenses. Finally, the lenses are packaged in sterile blisters filled with saline solution. This solution keeps soft lenses hydrated and all lenses ready for use. Advanced Types of Contact Lenses Today, advancements in eye care have led to the development of customized contact lenses for specific eye conditions. For example, specially crafted lenses can now be made for irregularly shaped corneas. Additionally, advancements in materials have led to extended wear options for both soft and RGP lenses, allowing comfortable wear for extended periods. If you are undergoing dry eye treatment, be sure to work closely with your eye doctor to find the best solution for your vision needs. Get Your Lenses From Lumen Optometric Today The manufacturing process of contact lenses is a complex and precise dance of science and technology, catering to the specific needs of soft and RGP lenses. The next time you pop in your lenses, take a moment to appreciate the incredible journey they’ve taken to help you see the world clearly and comfortably.

These lenses offer a smooth transition between distances, eliminating the need for multiple glasses. They can also help treat other eye conditions. However, progressive lenses have pros and cons like any vision correction option. In this article, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of progressive lenses to help you decide whether they are the right choice for you. Pros of Progressive Lenses Here are some of the benefits of progressive lenses. Improved Vision Progressive lenses provide a more seamless transition between different prescriptions, allowing for clearer vision at all distances. Wearers can see objects at varying lengths without switching glasses or straining their eyes. Greater Comfort Progressive lenses eliminate the visible lines that come with traditional bifocals or trifocals. This makes them a more comfortable option for extended wear, particularly for activities like driving or using a computer. More Natural Vision Progressive lenses provide a more natural visual experience than traditional bifocals or reading glasses. This is because they offer a gradual change in prescription, mimicking how the eyes naturally adjust to different distances. Improved Aesthetics With no visible line, progressive lenses provide a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. This appeals to those who want to avoid the stigma of traditional bifocals or reading glasses. Cons of Progressive Lenses Despite their many advantages, there are drawbacks to progressive lenses. These include the following: Cost Progressive lenses can be more expensive than traditional bifocals or reading glasses because they require more advanced technology. This can be a barrier for those on a budget or without insurance coverage for vision correction. Adaptation Period Adjusting to progressive lenses can take some time. This can cause some initial discomfort or disorientation. Reduced Peripheral Vision Since progressive lenses have a narrow corridor of clear vision, wearers may experience reduced peripheral vision. This can be a safety concern, especially when driving or navigating unfamiliar environments. Increased Risk of Glare Progressive lenses can create more reflections and glare, particularly in bright light conditions. This can be an issue for those outdoors or in environments with bright lighting. How to Adapt to Progressive Lenses When adapting to progressive lenses, allow a few days for your eyes to get used to your new lens prescription. Practice focusing on familiar objects that are located at different distances from you so you can easily switch between far and near vision when needed. Patience also goes a long way in getting used to progressive lenses. To be sure that progressive lenses are right for you, schedule a consultation at Lumen Optometric.

As a parent, you also want to make sure that your child can see well enough to do the things they enjoy doing. Pediatric optometrists are specialized healthcare professionals who care for the visual and ocular needs of infants, children, and teens. In this article, we will discuss some factors you must consider when choosing an optometrist for your children. Location Location is essential when choosing the best optometrist for kids near you. If your child has a busy schedule, it may be more difficult for them to travel long distances to get to their appointments. Maybe you’re unsure about how far away from home an office is. Ask the doctor or staff if they have any recommendations on other practices they could recommend that might better suit your needs. Call ahead if multiple offices are within driving distance of your home. Make sure each office offers the same services before making an appointment with them. Experience The experience of an optometrist for children is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing the best eye doctor for kids. An excellent way to gauge this is by asking how long they’ve been practicing optometry and whether they have additional training relevant to your child’s specific needs (such as myopia management). Treehouse Eyes provides expert pediatric myopia care and ensures this with accessibility to Treehouse AMP, a video based parent education platform. Treehouse Eyes doctors are always willing to answer any questions regarding myopia and while also cultivating a kid friendly office experience. Recommendations The best way to find a pediatric optometrist you can rely on and who will get along well with your child is through referrals and recommendations. If you know someone who had a positive experience with an eye doctor, find out who they used and why they thought so highly of them. Consider that some of your friends have young children of their own. Before choosing which practice is best for you and your family, it might be useful to know what kind of experiences other people have had there. If no one in your family or circle of friends can personally recommend an optometrist, look online for reviews of nearby practices. You can also use the Google Maps business filter by typing “optometrist for children near me” into the search bar. You can add whatever city or town you live in and see the reviews. This should bring up several options nearby where children receive treatment from professionals specializing in vision care issues explicitly related to young people (such as myopia). Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor. Schedule a consultation now to find out more.

The right glasses are comfortable and give you sharp vision throughout the day. Despite the dependability of this eyewear, it can still cause spots or pimples to form on your face. Fortunately, there are several ways to avoid this issue. Here’s what you can do to prevent breakouts from wearing eyeglasses. Clean Your Glasses Frequently The pressure that eyeglasses put on your skin is what usually causes acne. It prevents dead skin cells from shedding, causing them to clog your pores and form pimples. If you have oily skin or wear thick layers of makeup, you are more likely to get breakouts from eyeglass wear. Regularly cleaning your eyeglasses will help prevent breakouts. You can use an alcohol wipe to clean them, focusing on areas that touch your skin. Have Your Glasses Adjusted Does it feel like your glasses are so heavy or pushing too hard on your nose? Excessive pressure from your glasses can contribute to breakouts. If this is the case, see your eye doctor and have your eyeglass frame adjusted. In some cases, replacing the nose bridges allow more even pressure distribution. Give Your Face a Break from Eyeglasses When you wear eyeglasses every day, it’s easy to forget that you even have them on. While they give you sharper vision, it helps to take breaks from wearing them from time to time. It relieves the pressure on your face that often contributes to breakouts. Remove Your Makeup at the End of the Day Thoroughly remove your makeup at the end of the day. Cosmetic products can accumulate under your glasses, increasing the likelihood of acne. Using makeup remover before cleansing ensures that you’re really getting rid of the products on your face. Don’t wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor.

Without proper treatment, vision problems can affect a child’s learning, increase the risk of permanent vision loss and even lead to behavioral issues. The American Optometric Association strongly recommends your little one see an eye exam doctor yearly. This Healthy Vision Month, we are sharing tips on taking a proactive approach to your child’s eye health. Avoid Excess Screen Time At least two screen time increases the risk of obesity, mood swings, aggressive behavior and obesity in children. The blue light from digital devices can contribute to digital eye strain. This eye condition is usually characterized by blurred vision, dry eye, headaches, and neck and shoulder pain. According to the Department of Health, children below two should have no screen time because it can affect physical and language development. Schedule Regular Eye Exams It’s a common misconception that you only need to see an eye care specialist if you need to update your contact lenses or eyeglasses. Regular eye exams can detect and treat eye conditions early in adults and children. If you see your child constantly squinting, tilting their head, or rubbing their eyes, schedule an appointment with your eye doctor immediately. These are common signs of vision problems in young individuals. Prepare Well Balanced Meals Incorporating leafy greens and foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids in your daily meals is beneficial to the entire family’s eye health. Vitamin A in leafy greens can lower the risk of dry eye syndrome, while omega 3 fatty acids can lower the risk of cataracts and age related macular degeneration. It’s also a good idea to consume fruits rich in vitamins C and E, such as pineapples, oranges, strawberries and mangoes. These vitamins can help restore tissues in your eyes and prevent infections. Moreover, an overall balanced diet is essential in preventing obesity and hypertension, which contribute to several eye diseases.

Protecting your eyes from the sun’s damage is crucial to maintaining good eye health and preventing problems down the road. This blog post discusses the risks of UV exposure and provides you with practical tips for keeping your eyes safe from the sun’s harmful effects. Understand the Risks of UV Exposure UV exposure can have both short term and long term effects on your eyes. In the short term, you may experience photokeratitis, also known as “sunburn of the eye,” or pterygium, a growth on the white of the eye. Long term damage includes cataracts and macular degeneration. Some individuals are at higher risk for UV related eye problems, such as outdoor workers and those with light colored eyes. Choose the Right Sunglasses The right pair of sunglasses can play a significant role in protecting your eyes from UV damage. Look for sunglasses labeled with 100% UVA and UVB protection. Lens color and tint can also make a difference. Gray, green and brown lenses can help maintain color recognition. Consider polarized lenses to reduce glare, especially if you spend a lot of time near water or snow. Wraparound frames offer added protection by shielding your eyes from sunlight entering from the sides. Wear a Wide Brimmed Hat A wide brimmed hat can provide additional protection from indirect sunlight. By reducing your exposure to harmful UV rays, you can lower the risk of eye damage. Schedule Regular Eye Exams Early detection and prevention are essential to maintaining good eye health. Regular visits to an eye exam doctor can help you monitor changes in your vision and eye health. Comprehensive exams can catch problems early, giving you the best chance for successful treatment. Consider Protective Contact Lenses For contact lens wearers, UV blocking contact lenses can offer an added layer of protection against the sun’s harmful rays. Consult an optometrist to determine which type of contact lenses are best suited for you. Explore Orthokeratology Orthokeratology or ortho k, is a treatment that involves wearing specially designed contact lenses overnight to reshape the cornea. This non surgical procedure can help reduce the risk of UV damage to the eye and improve vision. Take Precautions During Peak Sun Hours Avoiding direct sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. can help protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. If you must be outdoors during these hours, seek shade whenever possible. Educate Children on Eye Protection Teaching children about the importance of eye protection from a young age is crucial for maintaining their long term eye health. Encourage kids to wear sunglasses and hats when outdoors to shield their eyes from the sun. Protecting your eyes from UV damage is essential for maintaining good eye health. By understanding the risks and taking the necessary precautions, you can reduce your chances of developing UV related eye problems.

Around 30% of teenagers, 9% of kids in school, and 5% of preschoolers have it. If both of a child’s parents are nearsighted, the child is more likely to have myopia. Myopia is generally on the rise, particularly in children. Experts believe that it might have something to do with spending more time indoors playing video games and using electronic gadgets. Read on to learn about some of the best myopia treatment options for children. The Development of Myopia When a child’s eyeball grows too rapidly relative to the usual pace of eye growth, myopia occurs. It may also develop if the cornea, the transparent window in front of the eye, curves too sharply. Light rays are unable to reach the retina when they enter the eye, which makes nearby objects look clear and distant objects look blurry. Treating Myopia in Childhood Although it cannot be cured or reversed, myopia can be managed and treated. The treatment’s objectives are to strengthen your child’s vision and stop it from deteriorating. Managing myopia is crucial for maintaining their eye health. Treatment Options to Combat Myopia Progression: Specialized Contact Lenses: Customized multifocal contact lenses are tailored to address myopia progression by slowing down eye growth in some children. Additionally, orthokeratology, also known as Ortho K, offers a unique solution by reshaping the cornea overnight, thus ensuring clearer vision throughout the day. Low Dose Atropine Eye Drops: Children may benefit from the use of low dose atropine eye drops, similar to those administered during routine eye examinations. This treatment approach has shown promise in managing myopia progression effectively. Increasing Outdoor Time: Encouraging children to spend more time outdoors can help counteract the onset and progression of myopia. Balancing screen time with outdoor activities is vital for safeguarding their eye health as they continue to grow. Consultation with a Treehouse Eyes Provider: For parents unsure about the most suitable treatment option for their child, consulting with a qualified optometrist is essential. Optometrists with myopia management expertise can provide personalized recommendations and guidance tailored to each child’s specific needs and circumstances. In conclusion, addressing myopia in children requires a comprehensive approach focused on effective treatment strategies and proactive management techniques. By leveraging innovative solutions and collaborating with eye care professionals, parents can ensure optimal vision health for their children both now and in the future. If you’re not sure which treatment would be the best choice, consult your optometrist to determine how you can manage your child’s myopia.

This eye condition can cause cloudy or blurred vision and increased light sensitivity. Patients may also experience poor night vision or notice that colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. While cataracts usually occur in older adults, this eye condition can happen to anyone. A local scleral optometrist shares the different types of cataracts. Types of Cataracts Age Related Cataracts Cataracts can occur due to the changes in your eyes as you age. You’re more prone to age related cataracts if you drink alcohol excessively, smoke cigarettes, take steroids and have diabetes. A family history of this eye condition and past eye surgeries also increases your risk for this eye condition. Congenital Cataracts Some people are born with cataracts or develop them in the first year of life. It’s not common for children to have cataracts. If your child’s cataracts are large enough to impact vision, immediate treatment is necessary to avoid further eye problems, like amblyopia or lazy eye. Traumatic Cataracts Blunt and penetrating eye injuries usually cause traumatic cataracts. This form of cataract may develop immediately or years after the eye injury. Secondary Cataracts There is a chance for scar tissue to develop in the eye after cataract surgery. If this happens, your vision will become cloudy again. Secondary cataracts are more common than you think and occur in two out of five people who get cataract surgery. A quick and non invasive procedure called YAG laser capsulotomy is the typical treatment for this type of cataract. Patients usually gain normal vision a few days following treatment. How Are Cataracts Diagnosed? Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial for the early detection of vision threatening conditions like macular degeneration and cataracts. Individuals older than 60 should schedule a dilated eye exam every one to two years. During your appointment, your eye care provider will use dilating eye drops to widen your pupil and check for signs of cataracts and other eye issues. Your doctor might also perform a refraction test, ophthalmoscopy and slit lamp test. These tests will help them determine if you need new prescription glasses or dry eye treatment. How Are Cataracts Treated? If you have cataracts, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. In the initial stages of this eye condition, prescription glasses or contact lenses can help improve vision. You can also use brighter lights in your home and wear anti glare sunglasses outdoors. Moreover, your eye doctor will recommend surgery if cataracts are starting to disrupt your daily tasks. You don’t need to wait for your vision to change before seeing your eye doctor. Leave your eye care needs to Lumen Optometric. Besides comprehensive eye exams, we also offer neurolens treatment, scleral lenses and orthokeratology.

In this article, eye care specialists take a look at profiles of patients who may need extra UV eye protection. Construction Workers: Construction workers and other people who work outdoors are exposed to 10 20% more UV light than the average indoor worker. Even if a worker wears a hat outside, the brim can only block their eyes from overhead UV light and not the indirect UV radiation that is reflected on low level surfaces. Outdoor Enthusiasts: Outdoor enthusiasts such as cyclists and hikers spend a lot of time in the sun, thus requiring some protection from UV. Boaters and beachgoers should also equip themselves with eye protection because dry sand can reflect more than 15% of UV light while sea foam can reflect up to 30%. Children: Some kids tend to spend more time outdoors than adults. Long term effects of sun damage are cumulative. The longer children are not protected from the harmful rays of the sun, the more likely they will suffer damage to their eyes in their older years. Contact Lens Wearers: Some patients who wear contact lenses do not bother to wear sunglasses because their contacts block UVA UVB. While there are lenses that protect from UV radiation, they do not cover everything. The skin of the lids and brow bone are left vulnerable and should be covered with a pair of sunglasses. Health Conscious Individuals: If you are conscious about your health, you want to minimize your day to day interaction with environmental hazards. Aside from eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, safeguarding your eyes from UV radiation should be on your priority list, especially if you have a family history of age related macular degeneration.

As such, the process of making prescription lenses involves several steps. Continue reading to learn about prescription lenses, how they are made and the different types available. What Are Prescription Lenses? Prescription lenses are tailored spectacles that correct or improve the wearer’s vision. A dedicated optometrist assesses the unique needs of your eyes and prescribes lenses that adjust how light gets into your eyes, helping you see better. The Process of Making Prescription Lenses Making prescription lenses involves several steps, from the initial eye examination to the final fitting of the lenses into the frames. Here is a general overview of the process. Eye Exam The process begins with an eye examination by an eye doctor. During the exam, they will determine your specific vision prescription, which includes measurements for each eye, such as sphere power (for nearsightedness or farsightedness), cylinder power (for astigmatism) and axis (the orientation of astigmatism correction). If you have presbyopia, your doctor may also determine your reading prescription. Eye exams can also check for eye diseases so your doctor can prescribe the appropriate solution. For those with special eye conditions, you may need to see a specialist, such as a scleral optometrist, to get the treatment and visual clarity your eyes need. Lens Crafting After the examination, your optometrist sends the prescription to a lab where your lenses will be crafted. Here, a machine cuts the lens into the shape advised by your optometrist based on your prescription’s specifications. Lens Finishing Lastly, your lenses undergo additional treatments. These can include anti reflective or scratch resistant coatings, color tints, or UV protection. These coatings improve the clarity and durability of your lenses. Types of Prescription Lenses There are various types of prescription lenses available to correct vision problems and suit individual needs. These lenses are typically used in eyeglasses and may include single vision lenses, with a single prescription power throughout the entire lens. They correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. Bifocals have two different prescription powers in a single lens. The upper part corrects distance vision, while the lower is for near vision. They are commonly prescribed for individuals who have difficulty seeing both up close and at a distance. This condition is often seen in people over 40 with presbyopia. There are other specialty lenses available for specific needs, such as sports goggles and lenses for low vision individuals. The type of prescription lens you need depends on your vision correction requirements and lifestyle. An eye care professional will assess your vision and recommend the most suitable lens type for your needs. Lumen Optometric is one of the area’s leading eye specialists.

Blog eye care Vision and Headaches: Are They Linked to Each Other?Vision and Headaches: Are They Linked to Each Other? July 7, 2020 by Lumen Optometric Occasional headaches can be manageable for some people. But when these headaches begin to affect your eyesight or if your vision problems start coinciding with headaches, it can be a lot harder for anyone to bear. In this post, Lumen Optometric a trusted provider of eyeglasses and contact lenses discusses how headaches and vision can be interconnected. Types of Headaches That Can Affect Your Vision Migraines and cluster headaches are the usual types of headache that can affect your vision. Migraines are often described as intense pain in and around the eyes. A “migraine aura” usually precedes them, and it often resembles flashing lights, a prismatic rainbow of lights, or a zigzag pattern of shimmering lights. Meanwhile, cluster headaches usually occur in clusters and cause pain around the eyes. The pain typically radiates down the neck including the shoulders and comes with other symptoms like red eyes, changes in pupil size, eyelid droop, and nasal drainage. Vision Problems That Can Trigger Headaches Headaches caused by vision problems usually start when the eyes are overworked and you can’t maintain focus. Make sure to visit an eye exam doctor if you are experiencing any of the following: Eye Strain – This is common among people who work in front of digital screens for several hours and so they tend to overuse the focusing muscles of their eyes. When eye muscles become fatigued, a headache can be felt specifically around or behind the eyes. Farsightedness – A frontal headache or brow ache may occur if a person is farsighted. Farsightedness can make it difficult for a person to focus on nearby objects, making it possible for eye strain and headaches to develop. Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma (AACG) – A rare type of glaucoma, it causes the eye pressure to rise quickly and often results in eye pain, eye redness, cloudy vision, and an onset of headaches.

In fact, any changes to your vision should always be taken seriously lest they become serious. Vision changes refer to any alterations in your ability to see properly–and they are caused by a great number of things. The premier expert in neurolens treatment, Lumen Optometric, discusses vision changes and what you should know about them. What Causes Vision Changes Vision changes may stem from the eyes themselves or may be caused by many different conditions that affect the entire body. The most common reasons for these alterations are refractive errors, including myopia or nearsightedness and presbyopia or age related farsightedness, which affects your ability to focus on objects at a specific distance. And while anyone can suffer from vision changes, the elderly are more prone to them because of possible chronic conditions that affect eyesight. Aside from refractive errors, the following conditions may cause changes in your vision: Age related macular degeneration.Cataracts, or the clouding or loss of transparency in the lens of the eye.Dry eyes, which may be caused by blocked tear ducts, and will require dry eye treatment.Retinal detachment.Eye infections, such as pink eye or sty.Injuries to the eye because of work related accidents or otherwise. Symptoms of Vision Changes Any changes in your vision should be dealt with promptly to prevent eye conditions. When overlooked, these can lead to possible vision loss. You might want to visit your trusted local eye doctor immediately should you experience the following: Eye painRedness of the eyesBlurred visionIncreased sensitivity to lightDouble visionDischarge from the eyesItchiness and other irritationDroopy eyelidDecreased vision in dimly lit settingsInflammation Detecting Root Cause of Vision Changes There’s only one thing to do–visit a premier scleral optometrist like Lumen Optometric immediately for a comprehensive eye exam.

February 11, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Whether you’re working in a desk job or you’re attending online classes, there’s a big possibility that you keep looking at a computer screen for hours on end. As such, you may experience migraines from time to time. Migraines can cause slight discomfort and may even affect your vision and ability to see clearly. There are two types of migraine you might have heard of: visual and ocular. While both migraines involve changes in your vision, there are ways to tell them apart. Lumen Optometric, known for quality dry eye treatment services, explains the difference between visual and ocular migraines. Visual Migraine Visual migraine is a temporary visual impairment that may occur simultaneously in both eyes. Most visual migraines last for 30 minutes, but depending on your stress levels and overall health, they may last longer. You may also experience a migraine headache shortly after a visual migraine. The symptoms of visual migraine may vary. These include: Flickering blind spot in the center or near the center of your peripheral fieldA wavy or zigzag ring of colored light surrounding a blind spotA blind spot that slowly migrates across your line of vision If you frequently experience any of these symptoms, you should consider contacting your optometrist for a neurolens treatment. Ocular Migraine Ocular migraine, on the other hand, is a rarer type of migraine. Unlike visual migraine, ocular migraine only affects one eye. It causes temporary loss of vision, which occurs when there is reduced blood flow in the eye. Ocular migraines can also be triggered because of blood vessel spasms in the retina. It typically lasts for about an hour, and vision eventually returns. In addition, the most common symptom of ocular migraine is the appearance of a blind spot. This blind spot affects your field of vision and normally appears first in the center. As the migraine worsens, the blind spot grows and gradually blocks your entire field of vision. A migraine headache may also occur before, during, or after you experience ocular migraine. Visual and ocular migraines are usually nothing to be worried about, and they will resolve themselves within an hour or less. Nevertheless, if these types of migraine headaches persist, be sure to book an appointment with your eye doctor. Are you looking for a professional scleral optometrist in your area?

Blog eye care VR Headsets: Are They Bad for the Eyes?VR Headsets: Are They Bad for the Eyes? October 14, 2022 by Lumen Optometric Virtual reality (VR) headsets are becoming more commonplace and are now being used for applications other than gaming and entertainment. Since VR headsets deliver audiovisual content, Lumen Optometric takes a look at whether or not VR headsets are bad for the eyes. How Do VR Headsets Work? VR headsets are head mounted devices that consist of a display screen and stereo earpieces, as well as sensors and controllers that create an interactive and immersive experience. Putting on a VR headset shuts out the immediate surroundings, which means the user can only see the content projected on the display screen. Its sensors adjust the content orientation, which allows the user to interact with a virtual space from any direction. While mostly known for their gaming applications, VR headsets can also be used for work and education. The Effects of VR on the Eyes Similar to devices that deliver audiovisual content like TVs and smartphones, VR headsets present the same risks, including eye strain and fatigue, discomfort, and blurred vision. Studies have shown that the human eye tends to blink less when using digital screens. Blinking helps remove contaminants from the eyes and keeps them moist and a reduced blink rate can result in dry eyes. The eyes also tend to work more as the brain tries to reconcile the differences between virtual and perceived depths. VR headsets also induce visually induced motion sickness in some people. This “cybersickness” can persist long after the user has stopped wearing the headset, the symptoms of which include headaches, lightheadedness, difficulty focusing, sweating, and nausea. People who are prone to motion sickness or already have problems that affect their depth perception are especially susceptible to cybersickness. How to Take Care of Your Eyes if You Use VR Headsets Fortunately, there are things that you can do to help reduce the effects of wearing VR headsets. The following can also be helpful if your daily routine involves prolonged use of digital screens: Follow the “20 20 20 Rule”. Take breaks from using your VR headset and follow the 20 20 20 rule: for every 20 minutes you spend looking at a screen, look at something that’s 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Moisturize your eyes. In addition to taking regular breaks, apply eye drops to keep your eyes moist. Limit your usage. Don’t use the VR headset longer than you have to, particularly during late hours. In addition to eye strain, the constant exposure to blue light emitted by the screen can affect your body’s melatonin production and affect your sleep cycles. Lastly, visit your eye doctor regularly to prevent further eye problems.

In fact, they’re a component of your immune system that prevents infection, with tears containing water and salt to moisten your eyes as you blink. Sometimes, the glands under your eyelids may produce too many tears. When it discharges through your tear ducts, they become overwhelmed, resulting in watery eyes. This usually gets resolved without treatment, but if this is a recurring problem, refrain from wearing any contact lenses and have your eyes checked at a trusted eye center. Common Causes Normally, you produce excess tears when you feel certain emotions, as well as when you laugh, vomit, cough, yawn, or experience strong taste sensations. However, in some cases, the cause for watery eyes can also be dry eye syndrome. With extremely dry eyes, you’re not able to receive proper lubrication and you’ll keep producing excess tears. This happens if your tears don’t contain the right balance of water, salt, and oils. Your eyes become irritated which causes the overproduction of tears to spill through your tear ducts. Knowing When to See a Doctor Normally, your watery eyes will clear up without any treatment. But if it keeps happening, you’ll have to see your trusted eye exam doctor for a check up. They’ll be able to determine the cause of your dry eyes so they can administer the best treatment. Sometimes, the causes can be as simple as an injured or scratched eye. It can also be as obvious as swollen or red eyes. But other symptoms can also be tenderness around your nose or sinuses, as well as a severe headache associated with your watery eyes.

Blog eye care What Are Myopia Treatment Benefits?What Are Myopia Treatment Benefits? March 14, 2023 by Vic Doce In this blog, discover the benefits of treating myopia early. Myopia is one of the most common vision issues among children, with 1 in 3 being myopic. It’s an epidemic that is projected to affect half of the world’s population by the year 2050. At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to give children better vision for life so they can accomplish their goals and avoid other serious vision problems in the future. Short Term Benefits of Myopia Treatment Some of the short term benefits of myopia treatment include increased confidence in your child, better vision to engage more actively in school and other activities, and an overall better quality of life. 1\\\\. Improved vision: Treehouse Eyes offers a holistic approach to myopia management. Specializing in treatment options for myopia, Treehouse Eyes doctors take into account a child’s background, genetics, and lifestyle. After evaluation, your child will receive proper treatment for myopia such as contact lenses or prescription eye drops. 2\\\\. Better academic performance: Children with myopia may often experience difficulty reading the board or seeing the screen in a classroom setting. It can also cause a lack of confidence to speak up in class because of their vision impairment. Treating myopia can help your child see clearly and give them the confidence to engage academically. 3\\\\. Reduce Eye Strain: Children with myopia may experience headaches and other symptoms from trying to focus on distant objects. Myopia treatment can help alleviate these symptoms for your child. 4\\\\. Increased quality of life: Treating myopia early on can help improve your child’s confidence by allowing them to participate in a wider range of activities. This can also help them excel at hobbies they currently struggle with due to their vision. Some studies show the relationship between myopia and mental health issues. Myopia management can lead to improved mental health and overall happiness for your child. Long term Benefits of Myopia Treatment There are numerous long term benefits to treating myopia early on, which is where the Treehouse Eyes mission, “giving children better vision for life,” comes into play. 1\\\\. Reduce the risk of serious eye diseases: High myopia can lead to other serious eye diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachments, macular degeneration, and cataracts. Early intervention to treat myopia is key so your Treehouse Eyes doctor can greatly reduce those risks for your child. 2\\\\. More Career Prospects: Some careers may require good vision such as the military, aviation industry, surgeons and paramedics, or any rescue team such as a firefighter or a lifeguard. By slowing down the progression of myopia, your child will have a larger range of opportunities and won’t be held back by their myopia. 3\\\\. Lower healthcare costs: Treating myopia early might save your child higher vision care costs. Treatment of other eye diseases can be expensive, so the earlier myopia is treated, the less likely it could lead to an eye disease that is more serious. 4\\\\. Overall Improved Quality of Life: People with myopia may experience day to day difficulties with things such as difficulties driving, playing sports, or reading. Early intervention for myopia is key and can improve overall vision making daily activities easier and more enjoyable. Let TreeHouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes offer customized contact lenses and special prescription eye drops, and our doctors develop personalized treatment plans for each child. We will be able to determine which treatment plan works the best for your child at the first consultation with your Treehouse Eyes doctor. Schedule a consultation now to find out more.

Blog eye care What Are Toric Lenses For?What Are Toric Lenses For? October 12, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Astigmatism is a fairly common eye condition: about one in three people suffer from this condition. The cornea (the clear outer surface of the eyes) of patients with astigmatism is shaped more like a football instead of a perfectly round ball (which is the ideal shape for your eyes). This irregular curve bends light more in one direction and causes blurry vision. Fortunately, moderate astigmatism can be easily corrected using toric contact lenses. How are toric lenses different from normal contact lenses? Lumen Optometric, your trusted scleral optometrist, elaborates on the key features of toric lenses below: How the Shape of Toric Lenses Is Different Normal contacts have are spherical shaped whereas toric lenses are shaped like the side of a donut. Thanks to this unique shape, toric lenses have different refractive powers that can correct astigmatism. They also have a small weight in their edges make sure your contacts return to their proper alignment after you blink. (Whenever you blink, the contacts on your eye rotate.) Why It’s Important That Your Toric Contacts Fit Well It’s important that your contacts fit properly, but it’s especially so for toric lenses. That’s because ill fitting toric lenses that slip easily won’t be able to improve the clarity of your vision. What Are the Different Types of Toric Lenses? Toric lenses are either made of soft or hard (also known as rigid gas permeable) lenses. Soft lenses are comfortable to wear, but hard lenses which are more likely to stay in place tend to perform better than soft lenses. However, it usually takes a longer time to adjust to hard lenses. If you want to learn more about toric lenses as well as other treatment options, like neurolens treatment, for other vision conditions, consult your eye doctor. Looking for eye specialists near you? Lumen Optometric, a family owned practice, offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including toric lens fitting and dry eye treatment services.

If you have plans with your soon to be spouse, know that you don’t have to ditch your spectacles, especially if they are what makes you distinct in terms of personality. Here are some pieces of advice from Lumen Optometric to help you get the most out of the look on your wedding day. Make Your Glasses a Statement Piece You won’t be hard pressed to find a stylish set of frames nowadays. In addition to vision correction, they can help enhance your appearance, especially when you wear your wedding outfit. If you are getting a new pair before your big day, be sure that you treat it like jewelry. In other words, it should complement your dress or suit. Schedule a Custom Fitting Don’t go for the first frames you see right from the shelf. Schedule a custom fitting with your future spouse so you can find the perfect pair of eyeglasses that will match the style you’re looking for. Your eye exam doctor can help you choose which frames suit you best, taking note of the shape and other details of your face as a guide. You’ll want them to be of the perfect size and fit, so you can wear them from the wedding ceremony at church to the reception venue. Minimize the Glare It’s one thing to get the perfect frame size and style, but it’s also another thing to get the best prescription possible for vision correction. Your current prescription may no longer work for you, and your next visit to your eye doctor is essential for determining whether you need a new one. While you’re at it, why not ask about anti reflective options? Expect many photo ops at the wedding march and the reception, so lenses with this feature are a must have for your new specs. At Lumen Optometric, we want to make sure that you will get the best pair of eyewear possible that fits this important occasion.

Blog eye care What Can Make Contact Lens Fitting Harder?What Can Make Contact Lens Fitting Harder? September 30, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Ill fitting contacts can cause a host of problems, including sensitivity to light, dry eyes, and contact lens intolerance (a condition that causes pain whenever contacts are worn). That’s why it’s important that your contacts fit your eyes properly. The problem is that some diseases and conditions can make contact lens fitting harder. Lumen Optometric, your trusted scleral optometrist, gives an overview below: Dry eye – The surface of your eye needs to stay moist. Without sufficient lubrication and moisture, the surface of your eye becomes more vulnerable to inflammation. Wearing contacts can also exacerbate issues related to dry eyes. That’s because the lack of lubrication increases the friction between the eyes and contacts, increasing discomfort for lens wearers. Using artificial tears can help alleviate symptoms of dry eye. However, certain formulations work better than others. That’s why if you need dry eye treatment, it’s best to consult your local eye doctor. Keratoconus – This is a progressive disease that causes corneas (the outer layer at the front of your eye that’s responsible for focusing light) to become thinner and bulge outward into a cone shape. The cornea’s irregular shape distorts a patient’s vision and makes fitting contacts harder. Does This Mean Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes Still Wear Contacts? Patients with Keratoconus and Dry Eyes need to wear custom molded scleral lenses, which are larger than gas permeable contact lenses. Thanks to their large size, they can cover the entire corneal surface. Since scleral lenses rest on the less sensitive part of the sclera or the white outer layer of the eye, patients with Keratoconus don’t usually experience discomfort when using them. Lumen Optometric offers a wide range of professional eye care services, including scleral lens fitting and neurolens treatment services. Our proprietor Dr. Eric To is the only practice owning optometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society. As such, you can rest easy knowing that our team has undergone advanced training to provide the clearest and healthiest vision for our patients.

Blog eye care What Causes Myopia?What Causes Myopia? May 10, 2021 by Lumen Optometric The drastic increase in the number of children diagnosed with myopia during the past decade is astonishing but is it surprising? Not really. When you analyze the causes of myopia, it becomes clear why more and more children are becoming affected by this progressive eye disease. What Is Myopia? Myopia, often referred to as nearsightedness, is an eye disease in which the eye elongates more than it should, causing light to be focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina’s surface. Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors lead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status. Genetics A child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or your spouse are myopic. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all over the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day, whether reading a book, using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or another device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially in excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and progression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration of near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating novel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a magazine a few minutes at a time. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Other Risk Factors Associated with Myopia Height taller children and adolescents have a higher incidence of myopia than their shorter counterpartsEducation level There is a higher incidence of myopia in people with advanced degrees, as well as higher parental education levels.Ethnicity Individuals from Asian Pacific Islander communities are more at risk of developing myopia. If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease. At Treehouse Eyes, we offer the latest and most effective myopia management treatments to limit the progression of myopia so that your child can live his or her best life.

So, how can you make your home safer for your eyes? A few simple practices can significantly reduce the risk of accidental eye injuries. Continue reading to learn why practicing eye safety at home is important and how to maintain good eye health. The Importance of Eye Safety at Home Eye safety at home is essential for several reasons. For one, it helps prevent accidents and injuries that can lead to vision problems. Many preventable eye injuries occur right in the comfort of our homes. From minor irritations to major injuries, our eyes face potential hazards from everyday household items. Therefore, having an eye safety routine can go a long way in preventing eye health issues. Furthermore, eye safety at home is indispensable for preserving your vision and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By being proactive and taking necessary precautions, you can reduce the risk of eye injuries and conditions that may have a lasting impact on your visual health. Maintaining Your Eye Health at Home Paying attention to your eye health is essential for preserving your vision and preventing eye related problems. Here are some tips to maintain healthy eyes. Regular Eye Examinations One way to keep your eyes healthy is to have regular eye exams with your doctor. These exams help catch potential vision issues early and allow your doctor to prescribe corrective glasses or contact lenses or recommend other necessary treatments. Protective Eyewear Whether you’re doing crafts, cleaning your home, or mowing the garden, wear protective eyewear. Goggles, for instance, form a physical barrier between your eyes and potential hazards, minimizing the risk of eye injury. Safe Use of Cosmetics and Cleaning Products If improperly used or stored, cosmetics and cleaning products pose a significant eye hazard. Therefore, consider eye safety while using and storing these substances and close your products securely. Adopting Healthy Habits Adequate nutrition, regular breaks from screen time, and ensuring sufficient lighting while reading and working are simple yet effective practices to keep your eyes healthy. Monitoring Vision Changes Take note of any changes in your vision. Contact your eye care professional immediately if you feel discomfort or notice changes. If you want to schedule an analysis of your eye health, contact Lumen Optometric at or fill out our online form to schedule a consultation. We also offer other services, such as orthokeratology, myopia management and neurolens therapy.

Blog eye care What Should You Ask Your Doctor During an Eye Exam?What Should You Ask Your Doctor During an Eye Exam? June 14, 2022 by Lumen Optometric An annual eye exam is one of the best ways to keep your eyes healthy. Since you’ll only be seeing your eye doctor once a year, you need to make the most of it. That includes asking the important questions pertaining to the current state of your eyesight. Lumen Optometric lists some of them below. “Are My Eyes Healthy?” If your doctor detects a disease during the eye exam such as age related macular degeneration or glaucoma, they will educate you thoroughly and advise you how to safeguard your eyes. However, even if you haven’t been diagnosed with such, it’s best to prioritize your wellness, especially when it comes to your vision. Be sure to ask your doctor if there are ways to improve your vision and ocular health. They will be able to present you with options to retain your healthy eyesight. “Are There Any Changes I Should Do to Protect My Eyes?” Several eye diseases have been linked to UV exposure, from cataracts to eye cancers. Sunglasses can prevent these issues, but your eye doctor may recommend UV blocking contact lenses to block the peripheral light that sunglasses cannot block. If you are already wearing a contact lens, you can replace your lenses as prescribed by your doctor. “Are Digital Devices Affecting My Eyesight?” More than 83% of Americans use digital devices for more than two hours each day, which can lead to digital eye strain. Common symptoms include eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes. During the eye exam, your eye doctor can suggest several tips to alleviate digital eye strain. These may include offering dry eye treatment, changing the lighting and display settings, or wearing specialized prescriptions, including contact lenses. “When Should I Return for My Next Visit?” Depending on your age, vision, and medical history, your eye doctor will determine how often you need an exam. Staying on schedule is crucial, especially if you have underlying eye conditions that need to be treated. Most eye care centers may schedule your next appointment right away. Otherwise, be sure to set a reminder on your phone. Here at Lumen Optometric, our eye care professionals are happy to assist you with your eye health concerns. We also provide top quality eye care services, including neurolens treatment and more. Give us a call at or fill out our online contact form to book an appointment.

Children frequently experience myopia progression, which lowers their quality of life and increases risks to their eye health. Myopia control treatments are now able to improve children’s vision and promote long term eye health. Read on to find out more! What is Myopia? People with myopia have blurred vision when looking at objects from a distance. When myopia worsens, the blur can become noticeable even when the object is close to or at arm’s length. Near sightedness or short sightedness are other names for it. Myopia usually begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 14 and generally becomes progressively worse every several months in children. It results from the eyes’ rapid and excessive expansion relative to the usual pace of eye growth. The eyes should continue to expand consistently in size until adolescence, then stabilize. However, with myopia, the eyes develop too quickly, causing rapid and continuous vision loss as well as ongoing eye growth into adolescence and even early adulthood. Myopia progression is the term used to describe this continuing deterioration. What is Myopia Control? The use of treatments intended to stop the advancement of myopia is known as “myopia control.” These treatments include atropine eye drops, soft contact lenses, ortho k, and special types of glasses. Myopia control is especially crucial for children, as it is in this age group that myopia is most likely to progress or worsen quickly. Both myopia management and myopia control are phrases used to refer to the additional clinical care needed for myopic children and adults. Myopia control typically entails using eye drops, contacts, or glasses to stop the progression of myopia. Myopia control is a broad term that encompasses maintaining eye health as well as various lifestyle and environmental factors that may contribute to the advancement of myopia. What are The Advantages of Myopia Control? The primary advantage of treating myopia is to reduce the risks associated with high myopia. Those with high degrees of myopia will have increased risk for diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachments, and myopic maculopathy. Myopia requires the use of spectacles or contact lenses to treat blurry distance vision. If your myopia is lower, you will be more functional in the mornings before putting on your contacts or glasses. You’ll be able to work a little better without them as opposed to becoming totally incapacitated without them. Additionally, a lower prescription increases the likelihood that your child will be a good candidate for laser eye surgery as an adult to correct their myopia, as well as the likelihood that they will have better visual results after surgery. What Else Should I know? Numerous studies have demonstrated that a child’s or teen’s visual environment can raise their chances of developing and progressing myopia. When creating the visual environment, do increase the duration of outdoor time your child has. Talk to your eye doctor or optometrist about the ideal duration they should spend outdoors and on screens and or reading to control your child’s myopia. These can play a significant role in ensuring the optimum results from myopia control treatments.

Keep in mind that conventional glasses won’t give your eyes the protection they need. A local eye exam doctor shares facts about sports eye safety. Blinding Injuries Can Occur From Combat Sports People participating in boxing and full contact martial arts are at significant risk of severe eye injuries that can lead to blindness. While there’s no standard eye protection for boxing, using thumbless gloves can help reduce eye injuries related to the sport. Basketball Is the Leading Cause of Sports Related Injuries Most sports related eye injuries in the U.S. occur while playing basketball. It is followed by softball, baseball, airsoft rifles, pellet guns, racquetball and hockey. When playing these sports, you must wear protective glasses with shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses. It pays to invest in protective eyewear that meets the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. At Lumen Optometric, we’re here to help choose which glasses or contact lenses are most suitable for your activity. Consider Your Risks If one of your eyes already has reduced vision, think hard before participating in a sport with a high risk of eye injury. Are you willing to risk your other eye? Consult your eye doctor to find out what kind of eye protection you need. They might also advise or discourage you from playing high risk sports, depending on the condition of your eyes.

This is especially bad when the person has ocular misalignment, allowing for a condition termed trigeminal dysphoria. The premier corneal reshaping specialist in the area, Lumen Optometric, shares more details about trigeminal dysphoria and how you can alleviate its symptoms. Who is At Risk of Trigeminal Dysphoria? People who experience trigeminal dysphoria–about 90% of them, in fact, according to studies–have ocular misalignment when viewing nearby objects instead of at a distance. This means their regular and continued use of digital devices becomes even more problematic since the task involves full on near vision. To compensate for this problem, their vision must work overtime. This, in turn, puts a strain on the trigeminal nerve–the largest and most complex nerve connected to the brain. When the trigeminal nerve is triggered, these allow for symptoms that include headaches, eye strain, light sensitivity, and neck and shoulder pain. How Do You Confirm You Have Trigeminal Dysphoria? The symptoms mentioned above are also associated with a number of eye conditions. To determine whether you actually have trigeminal dysphoria, you should visit a trusted local eye exam doctor like Lumen Optometric. Our trained and skilled eye care specialists will perform a comprehensive checkup of your eyes and accurately determine the root of its problem. If the results are indeed trigeminal dysphoria, we can offer a safe and effective way to alleviate its symptoms. What is Neurolens Treatment Technology? Lumen Optometric is the only neurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley. With the use of advanced and customized lenses, we can correct your specific ocular misalignment so you won’t have to struggle to see up close or far away. This means a reduced potential for symptoms involved with trigeminal dysphoria, allowing only for the most comfortable vision possible. Neurolens utilizes different technology to conventional contact lenses. To ensure you get the specialized lenses that can perfectly fit your eyes and help with your specific symptoms, Lumen Optometric will measure your eye misalignment using sophisticated equipment, SightSync. You’ll start noticing vision improvements with neuronlens within the week–those with extremely chronic conditions, however, may require at least six weeks before they can see the difference.

October 12, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Have you ever asked, “Why are my eyes so dry?” Turns out, this is not an uncommon issue, and many face it, especially in this digital age. There could be multiple reasons, from environmental factors to something more serious. Read on to learn more about dry eyes, including the main causes and treatment options. Main Causes of Dry Eyes Several factors can contribute to dry eyes: Aging. With age, our tear production naturally decreases. This is why people over 50 are more likely to experience dry eye symptoms. Gender. Hormonal changes, particularly during pregnancy, using oral contraceptives or menopause, can cause dry eyes in women. Environmental Conditions. Dry, windy, smoky or dusty conditions can increase tear evaporation. Also, spending long hours looking at the computer screen can reduce the blink rate, drying your eyes out. Medications. Certain drugs, including antihistamines, decongestants, blood pressure medications and antidepressants, can reduce tear production. Health Conditions. Certain health issues can cause dry eyes, such as Sjogren’s syndrome, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid problems. How to Treat Dry Eyes Treatment for dry eyes typically aims at restoring or maintaining the normal amount of tears in the eye to minimize dryness and related discomfort. Here are some of the most common: Artificial Tears. Over the counter eye drops that mimic your natural tears may relieve mild cases of dry eyes. Lifestyle Changes. Taking breaks during long tasks, avoiding air blowing in your eyes and adding moisture to the air at home or work can help. Prescription Medications. Certain prescription drugs can help increase tear production. Special Procedures. In severe cases, various procedures can be used, like closing your tear ducts to reduce tear loss or using special contact lenses. If you’ve tried home care methods and over the counter solutions without success, it’s time to see a doctor. Seek immediate medical attention if you have: Unbearable eye discomfort A significant decrease in vision Other symptoms like redness, swelling or discharge Dry Eye Treatment at Lumen Optometric At Lumen Optometric, we understand that every individual is unique.

August 3, 2021 by Lumen Optometric People who get new eyeglasses can sometimes experience discomfort. Some get nose pain and marks, while others feel eye strain or ear pain. To avoid these issues when getting new glasses or contact lenses, it is important to work with a reliable eye care professional. Here are possible reasons your new eyeglasses might be uncomfortable to wear. Your Eyeglasses Are Loose If your eyeglasses feel like they are falling every time you move, it could be that they are too loose around your ears. You can try to run your glasses under warm water and slightly bend the temple arms down. Another solution is to get eyeglasses in smaller frames that best fit your face shape. You Have a Low Nose Bridge You may have a low nose bridge if your eyeglasses slip down when you tilt your head. If this is the case, you may need the help of your eye exam doctor to find glasses that are suitable for lower nose bridges. They may suggest getting rectangular or horn rimmed glasses. Moreover, you can also try adjusting the nose pads of your glasses inward, so they sit more securely to your nose. Your Glasses Are Not Set Correctly When glasses leave marks on your nose bridge, it could be that they are not set correctly. It is easy to adjust the nose pads of your glasses, so they sit on your nose properly. Your optician may also adjust them or change them with another material, such as silicone, acetate, or nylon. If you have a plastic frame, it’s possible that they are too heavy or the bridge may not be big enough. You may want to consider investing in eyeglass frames with a wider bridge or lighter weight lenses. Incorrect Pupillary Distance Measurement You may still get headaches from properly sized eyeglasses if it has an incorrect pupillary distance (PD) measurement. PD refers to the distance between your pupils and is necessary for eyeglass wear comfort. Mistakes on PD are common for people who get their prescription glasses. Lumen Optometric is here to assist with your eye care needs. Besides glasses and contacts, we also offer neuro lens and corneal reshaping therapy.

Blog eye care Why Do Aging Eyes Need More Light?Why Do Aging Eyes Need More Light? September 6, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Your eyes and vision will reach complete development by the time you’re in your early 20s. Usually, you won’t notice significant changes in your vision until your 40s. It isn’t uncommon for older adults to experience difficulty in reading small print or need more light to see clearly. Learn why it happens from a local orthokeratology specialist. Aging Eyes: Why Do They Need More Light? In your 40s, the lenses of your eyes can start to turn yellow and get more rigid. It can reduce the amount of light that enters your eyes and affect color accuracy and focus. As you age, your corneas can thicken and become more opaque. Your pupils can also begin to shrink. These changes can further decrease and diffuse the light that reaches your eyes. Individuals who are 65 and older might need more light to see clearly. Their eyes might take longer to adjust from light to dark environments and vice versa. It can be more challenging for older adults to focus on nearby objects. They can also experience sensitivity to glare. Tips to Help You Adjust to Vision Changes See Your Eye Doctor Regularly Regardless of age, you must see an eye exam doctor regularly. Doing so helps in detecting and treating vision threatening conditions in their early stages. Macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma are some of the most common eye problems in older adults. They don’t usually show early signs, and you might not know you have them until they have progressed. Make Necessary Changes to Your Home People who are 65 and older often need twice as much light as young adults to see well. You can make your living space safer by increasing ambient light. Consider adding dimmer switches so each family member can easily adjust the room’s illumination depending on their needs. Place task lighting wherever they are necessary.

As another year unfolds, people usually start listing habits they want to begin and ones they wish to quit. In your New Year’s resolutions, it would be great if you could include things that can help with your vision and eye health. For instance, seeing an eye exam doctor regularly. Here’s what you can include in your vision and eye health resolutions for 2022. Reducing Screen Time Today, people spend more time on screens than ever before. However, excessive screen time can be detrimental to your eyes. It can increase your risk of developing dry eye syndrome, a condition that can cause your eyes to become red, dry, and itchy. If you have a job that requires you to use the computer for hours, make sure to give your eyes a break every once in a while. Practice Healthy Contact Lens Wear Contact lenses are a great option for people who don’t prefer to wear glasses. Using contacts is safe as long you practice good hygiene, wear them properly, and follow your eye doctor’s recommendations. You should avoid wearing contacts for extended periods, reusing old solution, and handling lenses without washing your hands. Avoid Constant Eye Rubbing While it may be tempting to rub your eyes when they are itchy, you shouldn’t. Doing so will only worsen the problem and put too much pressure on your eyes or even scratch them. You can use a cold compress if your eyes keep itching. If it feels like there’s something inside your eye, gently flush it with water. However, if the sensation persists, it’s best to see your eye doctor. Wear Proper Eye Protection The sun’s ultraviolet rays can be extremely harmful to your eyes. When going outside, make sure to wear UV blocking sunglasses. Moreover, use protective eyewear when swimming, cooking with oil, doing home improvements, and other activities that risk eye injuries or involve chemicals.

Blog eye health Beyond Age: Can Children and Young Adults Get Cataracts?Beyond Age: Can Children and Young Adults Get Cataracts? June 17, 2024 by Lumen Optometric Cataracts are commonly associated with the elderly; however, children and young adults can also develop them. It might sound surprising, but various circumstances and conditions can result in cataracts at any age. Let’s explore how cataracts aren’t strictly an age related condition. Dispelling the Misconception About Age and Cataracts While cataracts are most common among the elderly, it is a fallacy to say they are exclusively an age related condition. For various reasons, children and young adults can also develop cataracts, even if they’re wearing contact lenses. For instance, newborns can be afflicted with cataracts, a condition known as congenital cataracts. This congenital eye problem can be hereditary or caused by infections during pregnancy. Likewise, young adults can acquire what are known as secondary cataracts due to certain diseases like diabetes or lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Symptoms and Detection of Cataracts in Young People Symptoms of cataracts can be quite similar across all age groups, including blurred or cloudy vision and difficulty with night vision. Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial to detecting and managing this condition early. Your eye exam doctor is instrumental in this process, identifying signs that may be overlooked without professional evaluation. Management and Treatment of Pediatric and Young Adult Cataracts Treatment options for cataracts in young people depend on the severity of the condition and the individual’s age. In some cases, glasses or contact lenses may be sufficient to improve vision. For more advanced cataracts, surgery to remove the clouded lens and replace it with an artificial one may be necessary.

Blog eye health Eye Vitamins: Can They Improve Vision?Eye Vitamins: Can They Improve Vision? May 20, 2024 by Lumen Optometric It’s tempting to imagine that better eyesight can be achieved simply by adding a few vitamins to your daily routine. Although certain vitamins can influence eye health, these shouldn’t replace a well balanced diet. Before you rush off to buy these supplements, it’s important to note that these over the counter vitamins may not always bring the desired results and could sometimes even cause harm. Find out what the experts say regarding the effects of eye vitamins. What Are Over the Counter Eye Vitamins? Over the counter eye vitamins are non prescription supplements that may have the potential to enhance your eye health. You can find them in various forms, from tablets and capsules to liquid and powder. Can Eye Vitamins Improve Vision? Some studies suggest that specific vitamins may promote eye health and improve vision. However, these supplements don’t guarantee vision improvement for everyone. Their effect can differ based on individual health conditions and lifestyle. Vitamins That Can Influence Vision and Eye Health Several vitamins prove essential in maintaining healthy eyes. For instance, vitamins A, C and E are antioxidant vitamins that can help prevent age related macular degeneration, a leading cause of severe vision loss. On the other hand, B vitamins such as niacin and folic acid may reduce the risk of certain eye conditions. Balanced Diet vs. Supplement Intake Despite the potential benefits of these vitamins, remember that the safest and most effective way to acquire these nutrients is via a balanced diet. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats can provide the essential nutrients your body needs for overall health, including your eyes. Supplements should not replace a balanced diet but can serve as an excellent additional tool in case of deficiency or certain health conditions. Importance of Consultation Before Taking Supplements Think twice before grabbing eye vitamins off the shelf! Before beginning any dietary supplement regimen, let your eye doctor guide you on the best approach to supporting your eye health. Self prescription could lead to overconsumption, which can potentially cause health risks. If you need expert advice on any eye health concerns, contact Lumen Optometric.

Prolonged screen time can overwork your eyes and lead to eye strain, but the good news is that there are simple exercises that can help relax and refresh your eyes. Lumen Optometric, your go to provider of orthokeratology and other eye care solutions, shares five exercises that are specifically designed to minimize eye discomfort. Eye Strain Explained Also known as asthenopia, eye strain is a common condition characterized by discomfort in and around the eyes. These are often caused by activities requiring intense use of the eyes, such as reading, driving, or screen time, and the usual symptoms include dryness, redness, blurred vision, light sensitivity, and headaches. When you constantly fix your gaze on digital screens, your eyes have to incessantly focus and refocus, causing eye strain. Exercises To Prevent Eye Strain The following simple exercises can significantly reduce eye strain when incorporated into your daily routine: The 20 20 20 Rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break and look at something 20 feet away. This technique allows your eyes to rest from the intensity of the computer or smartphone screen. Blinking. This refreshes and moistens your eyes, which can prevent dryness and irritation. Palming. Rub your palms together to warm them, then place them gently over your closed eyes. Feel your eyes relax while you breathe deeply. Eye Rolling. Close your eyes and roll them gently in a circular motion. This helps to relieve tension around the eyes. Focusing Exercises. Hold your thumb six inches away from your face and focus on it for five seconds. Then, focus on an object 20 feet away for another five seconds. Switch back and forth. This exercise helps train your eyes. The Importance of Professional Eye Care While these eye exercises can help prevent eye strain, it’s equally important to have regular, comprehensive eye checks done by an eye exam doctor. These exams will help in the early identification of any potential eye related issues. Let Lumen Optometric Take Care of Your Vision Eye strain is a widespread issue, but the good news is that it can be managed effectively through regular exercises and professional eye care.

Unfortunately, it also brings factors that can affect your eye health and vision. Understanding these factors can help you protect your eyesight and enjoy all winter offers without worry or discomfort. Complications of Cold Weather on Eye Health During colder temperatures, your eyes may suffer several complications that warrant an eye exam. Dry Eyes: The cold weather often reduces the amount of moisture in the air, resulting in dry eyes for many people. Due to reduced humidity levels inside homes or offices and increased wind speeds, it can be difficult for tears to form normally. This can lead to irritation, redness, itching and burning sensations around the eyes that may cause further complications if left untreated. Wind and Dust: During colder temperatures, wind gusts are much stronger than usual, which increases dust particles being blown into our eyes. This can cause irritation and potential damage to sensitive structures within our ocular areas, such as the conjunctiva (the white part) or cornea (the clear front layer). Sun Glare: With sun glare reflecting off ice crystals in the sky combined with strong winds blowing snowflakes across areas where there should be little obstruction from sunlight, there is an increased risk for UV exposure. This can cause temporary issues such as headaches and long term damage, including age related macular degeneration (AMD), over prolonged periods if protection isn’t taken seriously. Prevention Tips for Eye Health in Winter Here’s what you can do to protect your eyes from the cold: Wear Protective Eyewear: Wearing protective eyewear will help reduce exposure levels significantly while allowing us to see better under harsh conditions. Protective eyewear contains polarized lenses providing clearer images even when light reflects off surfaces like bodies of water or icy grounds. We recommend investing in quality frames lenses designed against UV radiation to keep your vision intact. Hydrate: We suggest drinking plenty of fluids throughout days spent outdoors this season, not only because staying hydrated helps fight dryness caused by winds but also because a lack thereof could lead to negative impacts. Take Breaks from Screens: Staring at screens for prolonged periods can cause eyestrain and fatigue, leading to redness, itchiness, dry eyes and other complications. Taking regular breaks from any digital device, especially when wearing contact lenses, helps give your eyes a break so they can rest and recuperate more effectively. Eat Nutritious Foods: Eating nutritious foods rich in vitamins and minerals, such as dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes and oily fish, is important because these substances can help strengthen eye structures against external factors like dryness and wind. They provide nutrients that benefit long term vision health, reducing risks associated with certain conditions, including AMD (age related macular degeneration) and cataracts. Visit an eye exam doctor: If you are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned above or if you have any questions about how to protect your eyes during winter, consult an eye doctor.

This popular festival is a time for silly costumes, eerie décor, and, of course, delicious goodies. Nevertheless, many people are unaware that October is also Halloween Eye Health and Safety Month, a wonderful time to highlight the need to protect your vision during this festive season. At Treehouse Eyes, we believe in preserving your child’s eyesight all year round, ensuring better vision for life. In this blog post, we’ll explore some simple yet effective ways to protect your eyes and ensure a safe and enjoyable Halloween celebration. Choose the Right Costume Accessories: One of the most fun elements of Halloween is dressing up in unique costumes. Yet, certain costume accessories might be hazardous to your eyes. While choosing masks, headgear, and other accessories, use caution. Check that they fit comfortably and do not block your view. Be sure to try and use outfits with transparent, non toxic face paint or cosmetics. Beware of Decorative Contact Lenses: Colored or decorative contact lenses are a popular choice for enhancing Halloween costumes, but they can be dangerous if not worn properly. Only a qualified eye care provider with a valid prescription should be able to get these lenses. To avoid eye infections, never exchange contact lenses with others and adhere to the prescribed cleaning and wearing schedule. Mind the Makeup: Makeup is an important aspect of many Halloween outfits, but be cautious when applying it around your eyes. Use hypoallergenic makeup and avoid applying makeup inside the lash line or straight onto the eyeball for cosmetics safety. To avoid eye discomfort and infection, always remove your makeup before going to bed. Talk to your Eye Doctor: Do you have any questions about what not to wear on Halloween? Are you looking for fun contacts to tske your costume over the top? Trust your eye doctor to answer any questions you have.

It involves damage to the macula, or the part of your eye responsible for sharp, central vision. Symptoms may range from blurred or reduced central vision to distorted vision. AMD may sound scary, but did you know your diet can help significantly manage and prevent it from occurring?

The Role of Diet in AMD When it comes to AMD, it’s fascinating how far reaching the impact of your diet can be.

These nutrients contribute to maintaining the health of your retina and can be found in foods like leafy greens, fish, and fruits. Here are some recommended foods to eat to ensure a healthy eyesight and lower your chances of getting diagnosed with AMD: Leafy green vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and collard greens; Fish and seafood, especially oily varieties like salmon, tuna, and sardines; Beets, sweet potatoes, and carrots; Nuts, especially almonds and walnuts; Eggs; Citrus fruits and other fruits, like apples, bananas, strawberries, kiwis, and grapefruit; Fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin C, such as oranges, peppers, and broccoli; Whole grains, like oats, quinoa, and brown rice; Legumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas; Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese; Foods rich in Omega 3 fatty acids, such as chia seeds, flaxseed, and soybeans; and Foods high in zinc include oysters, red meat, and fortified cereals.

Blog eye health What’s The Ideal Schedule For Pediatric Eye Exams?What’s The Ideal Schedule For Pediatric Eye Exams? January 11, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Regular eye exams are an important part of a child’s healthcare. Pediatric eye exams can detect vision problems early and help children develop the skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. A scleral optometrist discusses the ideal schedule for pediatric eye exams here. What Is a Pediatric Eye Exam? A pediatric eye exam is a comprehensive assessment of your child’s eyesight. During the appointment, an optometrist will evaluate how well your child can see from near and far distances, their peripheral vision and depth perception, and any underlying conditions or diseases that could affect their vision. How Often Should Pediatric Eye Exams Be Scheduled? The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that all children receive comprehensive pediatric eye examinations at least once between the ages of 3 to 5 years old, followed by yearly checkups until age 18 (or 21 if still in school). However, certain risk factors may increase the frequency with which these appointments should occur. Issues such as premature birth or family history of ocular diseases, like glaucoma, cataracts, retinopathy, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, strabismus (crossed eyes) and uncorrected refractive error, may make your child prone to certain eye health problems. Even dry eye, a natural part of aging, affect children and require them to undergo dry eye treatment. In these cases, it’s best to consult your optometrist, who will create an individualized plan based on your needs and risk factors in your family history and medical records. What To Expect During An Eye Exam When you bring your little one for an eye exam, the doctor will conduct various tests to assess their eyes’ health and function. These tests may include: Visual acuity test – This measures how your child can see at different distances. Refraction test – An examination to determine whether corrective lenses are needed for optimal vision. Color blindness test – A simple screening tool that checks for color deficiencies. Slit lamp exam – Used to check for any signs of infection or damage on the eye’s surface. Retinoscopy autorefractor – A method doctors use to measure refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. If you’re looking for a comprehensive pediatric eye exam in Sierra Madre, CA, look no further than Lumen Optometric. Our team of experienced optometrists will work with you to ensure that your child’s vision is healthy and they’re seeing their best.

Perhaps they have been struggling to see things clearly from a distance. If so, they might be experiencing a common vision problem known as myopia or nearsightedness. Alarmingly, studies show that childhood myopia rates are on the rise globally. Read on as Lumen Optometric shares crucial insights into this escalating issue, its impact on children’s vision, and how early detection and treatment can make all the difference. Understanding Myopia Myopia, often known as nearsightedness, is a condition where objects up close are seen clearly, while objects farther away appear blurred. Usually developing in childhood, myopia occurs when the eye grows too long, preventing light from focusing directly on the retina. This irregularity causes distant objects to appear blurry, which could mean your child is struggling to see the school board or having difficulty playing sports. How an Eye Exam Doctor Can Help Detect Myopia An eye exam doctor plays a critical role in the early detection of myopia. During your child’s regular eye exams, they can accurately measure your child’s vision and eye health, diagnosing myopia and other potential vision problems. Remember, early intervention can prevent your child’s eyesight issues from worsening. Treatment Options for Childhood Myopia Once diagnosed, effective treatment options are available. One common approach is to prescribe contact lenses. These are usually worn during the day and removed at night, aiding in clear distant vision. Another advanced treatment option is orthokeratology, a non surgical procedure that gradually reshapes the eye’s curvature using specially designed contact lenses. One advantage of this process is that it slows down the progression of myopia in children, providing a more long term solution. How Lumen Optometric Can Help At Lumen Optometric, we’re dedicated to providing comprehensive eye care for your child. Based in Sierra Madre, CA, our team of eye doctors has the expertise to diagnose and treat myopia in children. Rest assured that we use the latest techniques, such as orthokeratology, to ensure optimal results and safeguard your child’s vision for the future.

Eye safety hazards during sports can range from minor scratches to severe trauma that can cause permanent vision loss. Choosing the right sports eye safety gear is crucial to protect your eyes from potential harm. In this article, we explore the different types of sports eye safety gear available and how to choose the right one for your needs. Identifying Your Needs When choosing the right sports eyewear, it is important to consider the type of sport you are playing and the level of intensity. For instance, you may need different protection for a non contact or low intensity sport like golf than for a full contact team sport like football. Choosing the appropriate eye protection will help protect your eyes while allowing you to play comfortably and safely. Features to Consider When selecting the right sports eye safety gear, these are the features you should consider. Fit Regardless of the type of activity you’re participating in, your eye doctor will recommend choosing eyewear that fits. Your eye gear should fit snugly and comfortably without slipping or moving during activity. Look for eyewear with adjustable straps or nose pads to ensure a proper fit. Comfort Your eyewear should also be comfortable to wear for extended periods. Look for soft padding or cushioning around the eyes. Lightweight materials that won’t bother you during activity are also excellent choices. Durability Sports eye safety gear should withstand impact and other potential hazards. Look for durable materials that can withstand rough handling. Polycarbonate lenses or frames made from strong plastics or metals work great for this purpose. Visibility Choose sports eye safety gear that doesn’t impede your vision. It should also provide you with a wide field of vision and have anti fog coatings, so you can see clearly during activity. Additionally, it may be worth investing in impact resistant lenses if you play contact sports. They absorb shock better than regular ones but still provide clear visibility even under extreme conditions. Lens Tint The tint of the lens is also an important consideration as it can affect your vision in different lighting conditions. Clear lenses suit low light conditions, while tinted or polarized lenses can reduce glare and improve visibility in bright sunlight. Shopping Tips Once you have identified your needs, research different brands and read customer reviews to compare features and quality. It is also worth asking for recommendations from friends or family who play the same sport. If you’re looking for eye exam doctors or orthokeratology or optometry specialists in Sierra Madre, CA, to help you pick the right eyewear for your preferred sport, Lumen Optometric can help.

Blog Eyes Is Myopia Hereditary?Is Myopia Hereditary? October 26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is an incredibly prevalent vision condition, affecting around 30% of Americans, with an estimated 20 25 million children untreated in the United States alone. It develops when the eyeball grows longer from front to back than normal, with the symptom of blurry distance vision. Myopia tends to begin in childhood and worsen over time. This leads many to wonder – is nearsightedness genetic? Let’s explore the evidence surrounding myopia’s hereditary patterns. Research Shows a Strong Genetic Link Extensive research, including twin studies, family patterns, and genetic mapping, provides compelling evidence that genetics play a significant role in myopia. While environmental factors can also influence myopia risk, the hereditary component cannot be ignored. Specific genetic variations affecting eye growth, development, and refraction have been identified that predispose people to nearsightedness. These genes often relate to connective tissues, neurotransmitters, and intracellular signaling. However, experts note there are likely numerous genes involved in determining myopia susceptibility and that environmental factors do play a role. Overall, studies show parents who are nearsighted have a greater chance of passing myopia on to their children. The odds also increase if both parents are nearsighted. The precise risk depends on the severity of parental myopia as well as environmental exposures. Ethnic patterns also demonstrate a genetic link. Asian countries, for example, have a much higher rate of myopia than European countries or the United States. While genetics play a key role, lifestyle and environmental factors fine tune how these predispositions manifest. But the bottom line is clear – nearsightedness has a powerful hereditary component overall. Myopia Progression in Children Since myopia most often develops and worsens during childhood, this is the period when genetic risk is most influential. Children with one or more myopic parents need close monitoring as their eyes continue to grow and develop refractive errors. Rapid myopia progression is especially common between ages 8 15. This is a critical time when interventions can help safeguard a child’s eyesight and offset inherited risks. Implementing myopia control techniques at younger ages appears to have the greatest impact on slowing progression long term. The complex interplay between hereditary susceptibility and environmental exposures determines if and when myopia manifests and progresses in children. However, identifying and addressing genetic predispositions early helps preserve vision potential. Warning Signs of Myopia Onset in Children For children with a family history of nearsightedness, be vigilant about the following signs that may indicate myopia onset: Squinting or eye rubbing Difficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading close work Headaches after visual tasks Sitting very close to the TV Tilting head or closing one eye Holding objects close to face Any appearance of nearsighted symptoms warrants a comprehensive eye exam to assess the child’s status. Long Term Impacts of High Myopia In addition to blurred distance vision, high degrees of nearsightedness increase vulnerability for several blinding eye diseases later in adulthood. These include: Retinal detachment and tears Open angle glaucoma Myopic maculopathy Advancing myopia also further elevates the risk of vision loss from these ocular conditions. Catching and controlling early myopia development can therefore help preserve long term eye health and function. By understanding the hereditary factors at play and monitoring children’s eyes proactively, the impacts of myopia on visual and ocular health can be reduced over a lifetime. Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Compelling research confirms that nearsightedness (myopia) is influenced by genetic factors. And while they’re not the only factor, children with one or more myopic parents, especially at high degrees, need thorough eye exams starting at an early age to determine if they are developing refractive errors indicating myopia onset. Through early detection and consistent treatment, the progression of inherited myopia risks can be significantly slowed. While genetic predispositions cannot be changed, being proactive allows for preserving a child’s vision and safeguarding their eye health over time.

Blog Eyes What is Nearsightedness and How is it treated?What is Nearsightedness and How is it treated? October 26, 2023 by Lumen Optometric Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is one of the most common vision conditions affecting approximately 30+% of people in the United States. In fact, it is estimated that 20 25 million children have Myopia in the United States alone. With nearsightedness, objects up close are seen clearly while distant objects appear blurry or out of focus. This results when the eye grows too long from front to back measured by the axial length of the eye. The elongation of the eyeball causes light rays to focus incorrectly on the retina resulting in blurry distance vision. While nearsightedness cannot be cured, there are various options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia (nearsightedness). What Causes Nearsightedness? Nearsightedness occurs when the eyeball grows longer than normal from front to back. This causes the light entering the eye to focus in front of the retina rather than directly on it. This results in blurred distance vision, while near vision remains unaffected. Several factors contribute to the risk of developing nearsightedness, such as: Genetics – Research shows nearsightedness has a hereditary component. Children are more likely to be nearsighted if one or both parents have the condition vs. none. Frequent near work – Activities requiring prolonged close vision like reading and screen use may encourage eyesight to adapt towards nearsightedness over time. Excessive screen time – Increased use of computers, smartphones, tablets, and other screens is linked to rising myopia rates, especially in childhood. Reduced Outdoor time – Some studies indicate lack of outdoor exposure, natural sunlight, and vitamin D are associated with a greater incidence of nearsightedness. Urbanization – Populations living in urban versus rural areas tend to have higher rates of myopia on average. Ethnicity – Individuals of Asian descent have a higher prevalence of nearsightedness. Many Asian countries see nearsightedness (myopia) rates of over 80%. Signs and Symptoms The primary symptom of nearsightedness is blurred distance vision. When looking at distant objects like road signs, movies, whiteboards, or presentations, it can be difficult to see when nearsighted. This forces the eyes to strain and overwork to bring images into focus. As a result, individuals with uncorrected nearsightedness may experience: Difficulty seeing school classroom boards Squinting or leaning forward to see distant details such as the score of a game Headaches from excessive eye effort Eye fatigue after close work Poor night vision or problems driving at night Typically, both eyes are affected, though not always to the same degree. The blurry distance vision worsens gradually over time in most cases. Impacts of Uncorrected Nearsightedness Allowing nearsightedness (myopia) to remain untreated can lead to several problems for your child. Myopia usually progresses over time, resulting in greater blur and dependence on treatment or correction as you age. Constant squinting and eye effort add to fatigue and discomfort, and unclear vision makes reading and seeing whiteboards at school difficult. There is also evidence that myopia can have social implications, such as extracurricular activities that require distance vision become challenging. Not to mention many career options that have vision requirements. However, all these issues don’t compare to the increased risk of severe eye conditions like Glaucoma, cataracts, and the potential for retinal detachments. The severity of nearsightedness (myopia) typically stabilizes by adulthood. However, getting your child’s vision treated early provides significant benefits for eye health, visual development, and quality of life. Treatment Options for Nearsightedness While nearsightedness itself cannot be reversed or cured, there are effective treatment options for slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. The best option will depend on the severity of nearsightedness, lifestyle needs, age, and overall eye health of your child – all of which are taken into account when getting treatment with a Treehouse Eyes provider. Overnight Contact Lenses – Specially designed contact lenses are designed to be worn at night only, put in right before bed, and taken out in the morning. Called KIDS lenses, these custom contact lenses gently and comfortably reshape the front surface of the eye during the night, with an effect that lasts all day. These lenses are customized for each child to fit their eye and are designed to help reduce the progression of myopia. Daytime Soft Contact Lenses – These customized contact lenses are designed to be placed on the eye in the morning and removed each night. They have a special optical design to reduce the progression of myopia while providing clear vision during the day. This treatment allows children to be free from glasses all day while providing excellent comfort and vision for all their activities. Prescription Eye Drops – Another treatment alternative is a prescription eye drop, formulated to a specific concentration known to reduce the progression of myopia. These drops are applied at night before bed, according to the schedule your Treehouse Eyes doctor recommends. The child wears glasses or contact lenses during the day. This treatment is excellent for families concerned if their child is ready for a contact lens treatment, and often used for younger children or those showing rapid progression. Keeping Nearsightedness (Myopia) Under Control Below are some helpful tips you can start using right now to help slow the progression of your child’s nearsightedness. Reduce near work and screen time for children and take frequent visual breaks Increase time outdoors and exposure to natural sunlight Ensure proper use and wear of prescribed vision correction Eat a diet rich in eye healthy nutrients like vitamins C and E Get yearly comprehensive eye exams to establish a baseline and monitor for changes The Importance of Eye Exams Nearsightedness develops gradually over time but can accelerate quickly if not monitored. Routine eye exams allow early detection and treatment. Annual comprehensive exams are recommended for: Children and teens showing signs of vision issues Individuals with a family history of high myopia Those with existing myopia require close monitoring Let Treehouse Eyes Help Your Child Manage Myopia Treehouse Eyes’ doctors use modern equipment to develop personalized treatment plans for your child.

Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. The hallmark symptom of myopia is blurred distance vision, but it can also cause headaches, eyestrain, and difficulty seeing at night. What Causes Myopia? Several factors lead a child to develop myopia, including genetic, environmental, and even socioeconomic status. Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids all over the world are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day, whether reading a book, or using a smartphone, computer, tablet, or another device. Numerous studies have shown that doing near work, especially in excess (more than 3 hours per day), contributes to the onset and progression of myopia. Some findings suggest that the intensity and duration of near work are also important factors. For example, reading a captivating novel for 45 minutes straight will impact a child’s eyes more than skimming a magazine a few minutes at a time. Genetics A child is more likely to be myopic if one of their parents is nearsighted or myopic as well. If both parents are myopic, those chances increase even greater. Be sure to get your child’s vision checked if you or your spouse are myopic. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! What Can You Do? The good news is there are many things you can do you help slow or stop the progression of myopia. Get Regular (annual or semi annual) Eye Exams Even if both parents aren’t myopic, it’s still recommended to get an annual eye exam for your child. You can schedule a myopia consultation with a Treehouse Eyes provider near you. Many pediatricians are able to complete basic eye exams – be sure to ask them to check for myopia! Encourage Breaks from Excessive ‘Near Work’ More than ever before, kids are focusing their eyes on near objects for the majority of their day. Encouraging breaks from near work such as reading and electronic devices will help your child’s eyes and give them a chance to get back outside as it warms up. Spend More Time in Natural Sunlight As you encourage your child to take a break from near work, one of the best ways to enjoy that newfound time is to get outside! Natural sunlight, even in the classroom, can be protective of myopia. Be sure to wear some sunblock as well! If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision.

Both organizations now recommend children play outdoors more to delay the onset of myopia and support proactive treatment of myopic children to reduce the progression and eye disease risk associated with higher myopia later in life. What is Myopia? Myopia is a disease where the eye grows too long, resulting in blurry distance vision and increased risks of serious, sight threatening eye diseases, such as glaucoma1, cataract2, or retinal eye diseases3. An estimated 1 in 3 children in the U.S. have myopia and the prevalence has grown dramatically over the last 30 years4. Research has shown lack of outdoor time for kids and more near work, like reading and time on screens, drive the massive increase we are seeing in myopia5 7. Myopia Progresses As Your Child Grows Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. Natural Sunlight Can Help Myopia incidence is rising in kids. Less time spent outdoors and more time on near work such as reading and device use has led to higher instances of myopia. This is a global phenomenon that is most acute in developed countries, and current estimates state half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050. In fact, a recent study found that increased exposure to outdoor light reduces myopia development. There Are Now Treatments for Myopia There is hope for parents is there are several treatments now available that can slow or even stop the progression of myopia in children. These treatments, usually involving a customized contact lens or prescription eye drops, are proven to slow down the elongation of the eye so a child’s vision does not deteriorate as quickly. Parents should talk to their eye doctor about their child’s risk for myopia and if their child is a good candidate for treatment.

Myopia is an eye disease that occurs when the eye grows too long like the shape of a football. This causes distant objects to appear blurry and increases the risk of serious, sight threatening eye diseases in adulthood. As a parent, you want what’s best for your child. By learning these 5 important facts, you may feel encouraged to do more for your child’s eye health and long term vision such as ensuring that they get their eyes checked on a regular basis and turning to myopia management to prevent the rapid progression of this disease. The COVID 19 Pandemic Has Increased Myopia Prevalence In Children The significant reduction in outdoor time during the pandemic combined with the surge in screen time has increased the incidence of myopia cases. According to a systematic review and meta analysis published in Ophthalmic Research (2020), outdoor time helps slow down the change of axial length and reduce the risk of myopia. Similar results were found in a previous study in Ophthalmology (2013) that investigated the association between myopia in children and adolescents, and the amount of time spent outdoors. The study analyzed over 10,000 children and adolescents aged 20 and under and concluded a substantial correlation between increased time spent outside and the prevalence of myopia. Each additional hour spent outside per week was linked to a 2% reduction in the risk of myopia. Myopia Increases the Risk of Eye Disease Those with high myopia and rapidly progressing myopia in childhood are more prone to developing ocular comorbidities or serious sight threatening eye diseases later in life, such as: GlaucomaMacular degenerationMyopic MaculopathyRetinal detachment Myopia is a Progressive Eye Disease Myopia usually starts in childhood and progresses throughout a child’s school years, eventually stabilizing around ages 18 22. Since the eye grows in sync with the rest of the body, it’s only natural that it ceases elongating in early adulthood when the rest of the body stops growing. This also means that a child’s growth spurts often coincide with a higher prescription. Fortunately, myopia can be efficiently treated in order to prevent it from worsening as the child grows. Slowing myopia early in life can make a significant difference in your child’s eye health in their present and future. Myopia Is An Epidemic Myopia is a global epidemic that continues to worsen, affecting close to 2 billion individuals worldwide. If current trends hold, roughly half of the world’s population will be myopic by the year 2050, partly due to genetics and increasingly as a result of our society’s preference for staying indoors and spending more time on digital screens. Myopia Can Be Treated Myopia cannot be cured; however, its progression can be slowed or even halted. The goal of myopia treatment, also known as myopia management or myopia control, is to reduce or halt the eye’s rapid growth. Effective myopia treatment entails more than simply correcting a child’s blurry vision with glasses; it’s meant to prevent a child’s vision from deteriorating and, thus lowering their risk of developing severe myopia related eye diseases later in life.

It alters the shape and structure of the eye limiting its capability to focus on objects in the distance (blurry distance vision). If you have struggled with the condition before, your kids might also develop the disorder at some point in life. Myopia starts with signs small signs such as squinting, sitting too close to the TV, tablet, or book, and sometimes even manifests as headaches. Besides pain and discomfort, the onset of myopia can have a ruinous impact on the quality of your kid’s life. It can be hard to read the board at school or perform well in extracurricular activities. Therefore, it is imperative to diagnose and prevent myopia from worsening to more sight threatening conditions. We have hand picked practical ways you can utilize in curbing the progression of myopia in children. Let Them Spend Time Outdoors The bright and ambient light outdoors is linked to the modulation of correct eye development. Spending time outdoors can help reprogram the eye structure to focus on distant objects. You should encourage your kid to spend more time outdoors especially if he or she has already been diagnosed with myopia. Quality outdoor time helps to preserve good eyesight in addition to delaying the onset or progression of nearsightedness. Ideally, children need a minimum of 90+ minutes of quality time outdoors every day. Regular Eye Checks are Crucial Myopia is a very treatable condition, particularly when detected early. That is why it is crucial to take your kid for an eye test at least once a year. The disorder might show very few signs in its early stages, which is why establishing baseline measurements early is paramount. Additionally, some of its signs like headache and blurry vision can easily be confused for other conditions. When left untreated, myopia will gradually progress increasing the likelihood of contracting other vision disorders like cataracts or detached retinas. The only reliable manner to know if your kid is at risk of nearsightedness is through a clinical eye test measuring the axial length of the eye. If your eye doctor is not conducting this test, they are not providing you with the best measure of your child’s eye health. Limit Screen Time Excessive screen time and continuous near work are the greatest non genetic risk factors for nearsightedness. Activities such as computer use, drawing, and reading can cause a substantial amount of strain on the eye. If your children cannot avoid these activities entirely, it is advisable to limit the time they spend on them. Taking regular breaks helps the eye to relax and is ideal for managing the nearsightedness condition. Try Soft multifocal Lenses for Myopia Control We are still a few months or even years away from an FDA approved eyeglass for treating myopia. By wearing our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses, your child no longer has to depend on glasses to have clear vision during the daytime. We understand that at times, glasses can be an inconvenience for activities like sports and other vigorous activities. As such, our contact lenses not only allow your child to see clearly but also be free from the hassle of wearing glasses. In addition, our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses, like all our other products, are FDA approved, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Our doctors would also follow up in subsequent consultations to ensure that your child is doing well and that our Daytime Soft Contact Lenses are comfortable for their eyes. Go for Atropine Eye Drops Atropine eye drops can help keep the progression of nearsightedness in check by curbing eyeball elongation. The chemical agent also strengthens eyeball structures to prevent unwarranted eye growth that might occur in adolescent years to trigger myopia. Atropine eye drops are safe when used in proper amounts. You should always follow the eye doctor’s prescription when administering the chemical for effective myopia modulation. Overnight Lenses Might Help Treehouse Eyes’ Overnight Contact Lenses are specially designed to be worn only in the evening as your child goes to bed. As such, our Overnight Contact Lenses should be worn during sleep and taken out in the morning before your child prepares for the day. Specifically called KIDS Lenses, these lenses are custom made for each child to gently and comfortably reshape the cornea, which is the clear front surface of the eye. It’s incredibly important to ensure that our Overnight Contact Lenses are tailored to each child as everyone’s eye shape is different. If the lenses do not fit a particular eye shape, the eyes may get infected by a corneal abrasion. As such, at Treehouse Eyes, each child will undergo a consultation to receive his or her very own lenses that are fitted to their unique eye shape. Studies have shown that myopia progression can be slowed dramatically and, in some cases, stopped through this treatment in children. Conclusion Although it is impossible to cure myopia, the condition can be treated with several clinical methods including the use of daytime soft lenses. A nearsightedness (or short sightedness) diagnosis does not mean it is over for your child. Instead, you should focus on managing the conditions with the right practices to contain its progression and slow or potentially stop the disease in its tracks.

Unfortunately, many people are unknowingly adopting habits that could be hurting their eyes. That’s why it’s a good idea to examine your everyday routine and daily habits to ensure you aren’t inadvertently doing something that could hurt your eyes. In this article, your trusted scleral optometrist from Lumen Optometric highlights some common habits that are bad for your eyes. Bad Habit #1: Not giving your eyes a break. Smart phones, laptops, tablets,and other digital devices with LCD screens are a staple of almost everyone’s daily lives. While looking at digital screens cannot always be avoided, spare yourself from digital eye strain by resting your eyes after every 20 minutes of screen time. Bad Habit #2: Using contact lenses improperly. If you’ve undergone any type of lenses treatment such as neurolens therapy and need to wear special lenses, it’s critical that you follow your eye doctor’s instructions when it comes to handling and caring for your lenses. The same goes for standard contact lenses. Bad Habit #3: Rubbing your eyes. This habit might be a little harder to kick. It might feel gratifying to rub your eyes, but rubbing your eyes too vigorously can cause the blood vessels under your eyelids to break. Try a cold compress the next time your eyes feel irritated. Bad Habit #4: Not eating well. A well balanced diet is crucial to keeping your eyes healthy. Choose foods rich in vitamins C and E, as well as foods containing zinc and omega 3 fatty acids.

The degree of myopia varies and it happens to around 30% of children and teens. To remedy this, there are specific treatments called myopia control. But what exactly is myopia control? As your locally trusted scleral optometrist, we’re here to help you understand what you need to know about myopia control. What Is Myopia Control? “Myopia control” is the term to describe the methods used to prevent the progression of myopia. These measures are usually prescribed by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. They come in four primary treatments, namely: multifocal contact lenses, atropine eye drops, multifocal eyeglasses, and orthokeratology. These treatments are important because they can help reduce the risk of complications that lead to high myopia, such as cataracts, retinal detachment, glaucoma and even blindness. Multifocal Contact Lenses These lenses are designed to provide clear vision for people who have nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and other refractive errors. These are also designed for people who are experiencing the normal age related loss of near focusing ability called presbyopia. Atropine Eye Drops This is a kind of dry eye treatment that’s commonly used to reduce the pain associated with eye inflammation. It also gives relief from focusing fatigue by dilating the pupil to limit the eye’s ability to automatically change focus. Also called accommodation, the effect it has by atropine eye drops can be counted for its effectiveness in reducing myopia progression in children. Multifocal Eyeglasses The eyeglasses work similarly to multifocal contact lenses, which help wearers with presbyopia see clearly. This control treatment can also mildly slow the progression of myopia in children. But some studies show that the progression slowed up to 51 percent in children compared to wearing normal glasses for correction. Orthokeratology Orthokeratology, or Ortho K, are specially designed gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight while sleeping to help reshape the eye’s cornea. This slows down the progression of myopia as well as provides clearer vision during the daytime without the need for lenses or glasses. Some studies found that children wearing ortho k contact lenses reduced the lengthening of the eyeball by almost 43 percent compared to wearing regular eyeglasses for myopia correction.

Blog Information Can Myopia Be Prevented?Can Myopia Be Prevented? December 6, 2021 by Lumen Optometric Parents who are nearsighted often wonder what can be done to prevent their children from developing the same or similar conditions. While scientists haven’t yet found a way to guarantee that your child won’t develop myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness), there are things you can do to delay its onset and even prevent its progression. What is Myopia? Myopia is a progressive eye disease that causes the eye to grow longer than normal, altering its ability to correctly focus light onto the retina. This results in blurred distance vision that can make it difficult for children to learn efficiently in the classroom or take part in extracurricular activities. Myopia is often corrected with prescription glasses or contact lenses, but these methods simply correct the child’s vision while allowing the condition to worsen. Why is it Important to Delay or Slow Myopia Progression? The worse your child’s myopia gets, the higher their chance of developing sight threatening diseases like glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment later in life. That’s why it’s important to try and keep your child’s lens prescription low and controlled using the methods listed below. If your child doesn’t yet have myopia, following the same protocol will help prevent myopia onset for as long as possible. Is it Possible To Prevent Myopia or Myopia Progression? While many children inherit myopia from their parents, there are also several environmental factors that can lead to the onset and progression of nearsightedness. By making some lifestyle changes, it may be possible to delay the onset of myopia and prevent its progression. Boost Daily Outdoor Time Research shows that children of myopic parents who spend a lot of time outdoors have lower rates of myopia than children who stay mostly indoors. A recent study published in Review of Optometry (2021) concluded that children should spend at least 2 3 hours per day engaged in outdoor activities to delay the onset of myopia, especially if a child has one myopic parent. Another study published in Ophthalmic Research (2020) confirms the protective effect of “sun time” against myopia onset. When observing the myopia rates of 6 12 year olds, there were fewer new myopia cases in the group of children who spent between 11 15 hours outdoors per week, compared with children who didn’t. The researchers also found that the myopia progression rate was slower in the group of children who spent more time in the daylight. If you do add some extra outdoor time to your child’s daily routine, be sure to provide them with UV blocking sunglasses, sunscreen, a water bottle and other sun safe gear. Limit Screen Time Screen time is thought to have a greater impact on a child’s vision than other near work like reading a book, for a few reasons. Children are exposed to digital screens at a younger age than other forms of near work, and they tend to use screens for longer intervals of time. Additionally, the working distance between a child’s eyes and a digital screen tends to be shorter than the distance between their eyes and a book or other object, to compensate for the small print size and images. An article published in Review of (2021) examines the results of several scientific studies that analyze the relationship between screen time and myopia. Two of these studies found that the risk of developing myopia was 8 times greater for children aged 5 15 who used a smartphone or video game for more than 2 hours a day, compared to children who have 0 2 hours of daily screen time. And while we don’t expect parents to ban all digital devices from their homes, it is advisable to set daily limits on digital device usage. Try to cap your child’s daily screen time at 2 hours. Children under the age of 2 should have as little screen time as possible. Encourage Frequent Breaks From Near Work Any sort of near work, like reading and writing, puts a strain on your child’s eyes and can contribute to myopia onset and progression. One way to prevent myopia development in your child is to teach them to take breaks from visually demanding activities. A 2008 study published in the journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science found that the intensity of near work plays an important role in myopia development in schoolchildren. According to the study, the duration of uninterrupted near work seems to be more significant than the overall time spent engaged in close distance activities. Regular Myopia Eye Exams Whether or not your young child or teen has myopia, yearly eye exams with your optometrist are crucial to keeping their vision healthy and clear. It’s important to note that vision screenings in school are not enough to detect most visual problems, and certainly not for preventing myopia. Tracking your child’s eyesight yearly will help determine the best treatment for preventing myopia onset and slowing or halting its progression.

While instances and awareness of myopia are on the rise, to help spread myopia awareness we’ve written out the basics on childhood myopia, why it matters, and what you as a parent can do to help preserve your child’s eye health in the long run. What is Myopia? Myopia (often referred to as nearsightedness) is the most common cause of impaired vision in people under age 40, and its prevalence in children is growing at an alarming rate. Myopia typically starts in childhood and progresses (the eye keeps getting bigger), or gets worse, until early adulthood. During this time the symptom of myopia, blurry distance vision, gets worse, meaning the patient needs stronger glasses to continue to see clearly. If blurry distance vision is the symptom of myopia, what exactly is myopia? Stated again, myopia is an eye that is growing too long. How do we know this? We measure it using special non invasive technology to calculate the length of the eye from the front (cornea) to the back (retina). This distance is known as the axial length and is measured down to fractions of a millimeter with advanced equipment. So, myopia is an abnormal elongation of the eye. Risk Factors for Myopia Myopia risk factors include genetics (having one or both parents myopic), an insufficient amount of time spent outdoors, and excessive near work (time spent reading, school work, & digital screens). Childhood myopia is progressive, which is why your child may need a new prescription every year or two. Unless treated, a child’s myopia will continue to worsen until early adulthood. What some people don’t realize is that myopia is far more than simply blurred vision it’s associated with drastically higher risk of developing eye disease in the future. How Can Myopia Impact a Child’s Health? Childhood myopia places a child at a greater risk of developing serious eye diseases later in life, as compared to non myopic children, and the odds only increase as myopia continues to progress. In fact, a child with myopia is 2 to 40 times more likely to develop myopic maculopathy (also known as myopic macular degeneration, a serious vision threatening complication) depending on their degree of nearsightedness. Retinal detachment is another serious eye condition that can cause permanent blindness. A myopic child is 3 to 21 times more likely to develop this emergency eye condition in adulthood. Moreover, children with myopia have a threefold risk of developing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, in the long run. And although cataracts are considered a normal part of aging, having myopia advances the age at which they develop. According to a study published in JAMA Ophthalmology, individuals with high myopia are more likely to need cataract surgery at an earlier age than those with no myopia. Furthermore, aside from an increased risk of adult eye disease, untreated myopia can prevent a child from succeeding academically and socially. A 2019 study published in the Community Eye Health Journal underscores the importance of excellent visual acuity in school aged children. It found that offering vision correction to students with myopia has more of an educational impact than providing them with vitamins or medications to maintain or improve their physical health. Myopia has equally serious ramifications outside the classroom. A study published in BMC Ophthalmology (2016) found that adolescents with myopia are more likely to have anxiety than their peers with normal vision. Furthermore, adverse visual symptoms impact a child’s self esteem, according to a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science. The good news is that certain lifestyle choices, especially when coupled with myopia management treatment, can have a lasting positive effect on your child’s eye health. What Can Parents Do To Help Slow Myopia Progression? We know that parents want what’s best for their children. So here are a few recommendations that will help keep your child’s eyes healthy whether or not myopia has set in. Take your kids outside to play. Several studies have indicated that children who spend over 2 hours outdoors during the day have lower levels of myopia and slower myopia progression. A recent study published in BMC Ophthalmology and cited in Review of Optometry (2021) found that for non myopic children with myopic parents, “a high level of outdoor exposure had a remarkable influence on the risk of new myopia for children even with one myopic parent.” Although it’s not always easy, try to limit the amount of continuous near work your child does. Whether it’s reading or scrolling through a phone, remind your child to take breaks. However, the most important thing you can do to protect your child’s long term eye health is manage their myopia with treatment. We Can Help Preserve Your Child’s Eye Health At Treehouse Eyes, our goal is to provide expert care to each and every child with kindness and a smile.

Clear sight is vital for kids to thrive in school, sports, play, and daily life. However, many children have undiagnosed vision issues that require early detection and intervention for the best outcomes. Why Early Detection Matters Catching vision problems early in childhood is crucial. Early detection ensures children get the vision correction they need during critical developmental windows. Those children suffering from vision deficits can lead to academic issues, behavioral problems, and even low self esteem issues. Signs Your Child May Need an Eye Exam There are several signs parents should look for that may indicate a child is struggling with their vision: Frequent squinting or rubbing of the eyes Sitting very close to the TV or holding devices close to the face Tilting the head to one side Covering one eye Difficulty seeing the board at school Avoiding reading close work Losing place while reading Trouble differentiating colors Clumsiness or poor hand eye coordination Headaches or eye pain after visual tasks If you observe any of these symptoms, schedule an eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist who specializes in pediatric patients. An exam can identify issues like nearsightedness, farsightedness, lazy eye, convergence problems, and other disorders. Protecting Your Child’s Vision Health Along with regular eye exams, there are several ways parents can help maintain healthy eyesight: Ensure your child wears 100% UV blocking sunglasses outside Limit screen time and take frequent breaks from ‘near work’ Provide a nutritious diet with eye healthy vitamins Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure Following your eye doctor’s specialized treatment plan is also essential to managing any vision conditions your child is diagnosed with. The Benefits of Annual Eye Exams Getting your child’s eyes checked every year is a critical piece of preventive healthcare. At annual exams, optometrists and ophthalmologists thoroughly evaluate vision acuity, eye alignment, and eye health. Treehouse Eyes optometrists go a step further by measuring axial length to determine if myopia is present or not. This allows early detection of refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness) as well as other eye disorders like amblyopia or strabismus, which require prompt treatment. Catching and addressing issues early improves outcomes and treats the issues rather than just correcting them with glasses. Annual exams also screen for eye diseases and conditions that rarely show apparent symptoms in kids, like glaucoma. Preventing and controlling these disorders protects long term vision. Treehouse Eyes is proud to join in Children’s Eye Health and Safety Month by helping educate families about protecting one of their child’s most precious gifts the ability to see the world clearly. By scheduling comprehensive eye exams each year and remaining vigilant for signs of vision issues, parents can ensure their child’s visual development stays on track. If you have any concerns about your child’s vision, consult a Treehouse Eyes doctor near you. Healthy eyes and clear sight in childhood provide a lifetime of benefits.

Blog Information Do Your Eyes Grow?Do Your Eyes Grow? August 28, 2023 by Lumen Optometric The Complex Relationship Between Eye Growth and Myopia Development The human eye is a remarkably dynamic organ that undergoes natural growth and changes over a lifetime. One key factor that significantly impacts eye development is myopia, also known as nearsightedness. Myopia occurs when the eyeball elongates (grows too long) from front to back, causing light rays to focus incorrectly and distant objects to appear blurry. This eye growth is driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Research shows myopia is becoming more prevalent globally, affecting around 30% of the world’s population, with an estimated 50% by the year 2050. Theories for this increase include frequent near work on digital devices homework and less time outdoors early in life. Both can strain the visual system and put the eyes at risk for abnormal elongation. When myopia develops, the implications go beyond the need for vision correction. Excessive eye growth is linked to a higher risk of blinding conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment later in life. Myopia also reduces the quality of life, at school, when playing sports, participating in extracurriculars, and activities requiring distance vision like driving. So what proactive steps can be taken to support healthy eye development and reduce the odds of myopia onset? The most important step you can take is to get your child a yearly eye exam. This ensures that their vision is being monitored and tracked in case of issues like myopia. Below are a few other tips to help support your child’s eye health. Increase time outdoors, especially in early childhood. Avoid chronic use of screens mobile devices at young ages Maintain clear focus on distant objects through activities like sports Get regular eye exams to monitor for signs of abnormal growth Eat a nutritious diet and nutrients that may support ocular health Understand your genetic predispositions and family history The key is taking preventive actions early. Though myopia itself cannot be reversed once manifested, slowing or even stopping the progression is possible. Implementing healthy lifestyle habits and frequent eye assessments allows for early intervention against excessive eye growth in children. So do your eyes grow? Yes. Just like all other parts of the body, your eyes grow as well. Where issues occur is when the eyeball grows too long from front to back (a.k.a. Myopia), resulting in blurred distance vision.

Recently, doctors in our Treehouse Eyes community had the chance to spread the word about myopia with local media coverage. Our doctors are passionate about spreading awareness about the myopia epidemic and how early intervention can mean a lot for your child’s eye health. Explore some of the topics our peers covered in recent interviews. How To Tell If Your Child Is Nearsighted It’s not always simple to detect whether or not your child is nearsighted. Watching out for the common symptoms of myopia is key to determine whether or not your child needs treatment. Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Aimee Jacobs OD, discusses some signs to look out for. Dr. Jacobs explains, “If they’re having trouble focusing in school, if they can’t stay on task, if it seems like it might be a behavior issue, a lot of times it’s because they can’t see what they’re doing or they can’t see what they’re doing well enough to focus on it.” Screen Time As a Risk Factor As screen time increases, so does the early onset of myopia. Treehouse Eyes has observed a 30 percent increase in the number of myopic children being treated since the pandemic began. Dr. Tiffany Martinez recalls the effects of the pandemic on children, “During the pandemic we saw a lot more kids they we saw become myopic than we did before.” This is due to the decreased time outdoors and increase in near work. Another Treehouse Eyes partner, Dr. Ryan Stybel describes the effects of too much ‘near work’, “Screen time or near work is causing myopia to start at an earlier age but also progress more rapidly.” He then goes on to explain the implications of COVID isolation, “We’re just getting through a pandemic, myopia is an epidemic especially with the increased screen time and virtual learning. Limiting screen time is a very important thing and taking frequent breaks and spending time outdoors. We recommend 90 minutes a day outdoors to use the natural sunlight and looking at distance objects can be beneficial and help their eyes from getting worse.” What To Look For As a Parent: Myopia is a treatable and preventable disease, annual eye exams are highly recommended because often times children are unable to articulate their symptoms to a parent. Dr. Denise Smith, a Treehouse Eyes doctor featured on KVUE TV in Austin, Texas provides some tips on how to detect myopia, “Parents can be looking for if the child is squinting, if they can’t see the board at school they might be complaining of headaches, or holding books closer to their face holding their phone closer, maybe getting closer to the television.” So why is it essential to go through myopia management and treatment rather than just getting glasses? Dr. Smith explains why myopia treatment is critical, “If the child is diagnosed with myopia, just getting glasses can help them see clearly, but will not do anything to stop the progression or prevent the eyeball from getting longer. So you want to be able to have those specialized treatments to actually stop that process which in turn can prevent sight threatening disorders later on.” Let Treehouse Eyes Help Manage Your Child’s Myopia Treating myopia early is crucial to prevent children’s vision from getting worse. Our mission is to give children better vision for life so children can have a life advantage to being able to participate in more activities.

Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a common vision problem that will affect half the world’s population by 2050. It occurs when the eye is unable to focus on distant objects without corrective lenses like glasses or contacts. Myopia is caused by a variety of factors, including genetic and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. Is Myopia Genetic? If you’re thinking about myopia, knowing if it’s genetic is essential. If you happen to be myopic, then your kids might be at risk of developing the same condition. Myopia has two types: genetic and non genetic (or “acquired”). Genetic myopia is passed down through families and tends to run in certain clusters or patterns. Non genetic means that individuals develop their vision issues without any family history or a genetic predisposition toward poor vision. In general, suppose both parents have healthy eyesight but have children with poor vision (without any other eye problems). It’s likely that those kids were born with a form of genetic myopia known as Axial Myopia (AM). About half of all cases fall into this category! Why Does Myopia Get Worse with Age? When you find out your child is first diagnosed with myopia, it is essential to intervene as early as possible. Myopia progresses when a child’s eye grows too long from front to back, causing permanent and irreversible eye growth, known as axial elongation (the measure of the eye from front to back). When a Treehouse Eyes doctor finds a low level of myopia (nearsightedness), it’s easier to treat with a wider range of treatment options. In short, myopia changes as we age due to axial length elongation that occurs during childhood. The longer the eyeball gets, it’s associated with serious eye conditions that can lead to permanent vision loss such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts. This is why it is imperative to treat myopia as early as possible and start getting your child’s eye examined annually to catch any changes in their vision. How to Stop Myopia from Getting Worse with Age To prevent myopia from getting worse with age, it’s important to get your child regular eye exams and see the treatment options for myopia such as custom contact lenses or prescription eye drops. If you’re concerned about your eyesight, it’s always a good idea to schedule an appointment with a Treehouse Eyes optometrist. Conclusion Myopia is a common vision problem that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by a variety of factors, including genetics and environmental factors, and tends to worsen with age. The key to properly treating myopia and preventing it from worsening is by catching it early, typically in childhood. By following the tips mentioned above, you can help prevent myopia from getting worse and maintain good eye health.

There is some debate about whether myopia is a disease or a refractive error. The answer is uncovered by how myopia is defined and measured. What Is The Definition Of A Disease? The Review of provides a few definitions of disease to consider: A disease is any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional state of an organism, generally associated with certain signs and symptoms and differing in nature from physical injury. (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020) A disease is an abnormal condition affecting a living organism. Diseases are generally understood to be medical conditions that involve a pathological process associated with a specific set of symptoms. (Infectious Disease News, 2019) Myopia, also called nearsightedness or shortsightness, is the inability to see objects at a distance and is the most common vision issue amongst children and adults. Myopia’s main symptom is blurry distance vision; however, the physiological implications of myopia is that the eyeball itself grows too long from front to back, see figure 1 below. Is Myopia Curable? The question of whether or not myopia is curable helps illustrate why myopia is a disease. Treehouse Eyes doctor, Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. addresses the common question, “Can myopia be cured?” Myopia is not curable, but it can be treated. “Unfortunately, once myopia happens, which happens due to the eyeball growing too long, it is impossible to shrink it afterwards. When myopia occurs, it is permanent and irreversible.” Dr. Mai then goes on to explain the importance of early intervention, “We can prevent high levels of myopia which are associated with diseases such as macular maculopathy and retinal detachment. Starting treatment early is critical because there is no cure for myopia and once a child is diagnosed with this disease, it typically gets worse if left untreated.” Myopia is a disease that can be treated at the source by providing children with treatment options, rather than just giving a child glasses for the symptom of myopia which is blurry vision. Myopia Is a Disease Although myopia has symptoms like blurry vision, that aren’t caused by physical injury, myopia itself is caused by the eye growing too long. In other words, the axial length increases outside of the normal rate for a child’s age. See Figure 2 below. Image Source The elongation of the eye is the core issue. Dr. Thanh Mai, O.D. details, “The greater the myopia, the longer the axial length of the eye and thus greater risk. Myopia is clearly a disease. One that requires treatment to reduce the negative impact it can have on a person’s eye health and vision.” Myopia is a significant, prevalent disease in children with increasing rates of progression.

The goal of this procedure is to reduce myopia or nearsightedness of patients. To know more about Ortho K and what to expect, here is a list of frequently asked questions. 1\\\\. “Are there age restrictions for Ortho K?” None. Children as young as six years old have been treated with Ortho K lenses. In fact, the treatment is one of the most common methods of vision correction in pre teens and teens. 2\\\\. “Who is considered a good candidate?” Ortho K proves to be an effective treatment for farsighted, nearsighted and astigmatic patients. If your child has been unable to wear contact lenses, due to discomfort or allergies, they make a good candidate. This is because Ortho K lenses are easy to use and can be worn while sleeping. 3\\\\. “How do Ortho K lenses differ from typical lenses?” Ortho K contact lenses are specifically designed with highly oxygen permeable material. The back surface of the lens is particularly made to enable the reshaping of the corneal tissue. 4\\\\. “How long does it take to reach good vision?” Stable vision can be achieved after 10 14 days of treatment, depending on the prescription. In fact, 50 70% of the desired visual correction is attained after the first night of wear. 5\\\\. “How long can Ortho K provide myopia control?” The effect of myopia control should last as long as your use of Ortho K lenses. It is advisable for young children to wear the lenses until their late teens when myopia tends to destabilize. Fortunately, there are no anecdotal reports from patients that state ‘rebounding’ after their use of ortho K contact lenses has come to an end. To get started with Ortho K treatment, it is essential to contact a trusted eye exam doctor. Here at Lumen Optometric, we strive to provide excellent full service eye care solutions with outstanding patient care services to match.

This is especially true with the pandemic upheaving our lives and forcing us to stay home for virtual learning or work from home. The consequences are not just limited to heightened obesity rates. Studies have shown that having less sunlight could actually change the ways that a child’s eyes develop, resulting in a myopia epidemic that rises in tandem with the obesity crisis. You need to encourage your child to spend more time outdoors to protect their eyesight and prevent myopia. Downsides of Spending Time Indoors According to a recent Australian study, kids who spend only about 20 minutes per day outdoors experience quicker growth in the length of their eyes than those who log more hours in bright eyes. This can result in myopia and trouble seeing faraway objects. Thankfully, there are some ways available that you can still use to keep an eye on your child’s eyesight. They are listed as follows. Not Enough Outdoor Time Spending at least 2 3 hours outdoors has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of myopia in children. Make sure to send your children outside to play every day, especially if they’re at risk of developing myopia! Encourage Outdoor Time Our eyes need an optimal amount of bright light that can be gotten from outdoors. Therefore, by aiming for around 40 minutes of outdoor time daily, not only can your children get the physical activity that they need that day, but it can also be beneficial to their eyes and help to prevent the onset of myopia. Look out for Warning Signs It is important to look out for warning signs that your child might have myopia so that they can get treated for it early. Children suffering from myopia may squint, constantly feel the need to rub their eyes or complain of consistent headaches, they may also start having trouble with their academic grades. If your child experiences any of these symptoms, it is important to schedule an appointment with an optometrist. Schedule Regular Screenings To help prevent or manage myopia, it is important to have regular eye screenings for your child. Doctors recommend yearly vision screenings either by your child’s pediatrician or their school as well as a vision screen at well child visits through age 4. Newborn babies should also have their vision tested before they leave the hospital, and before your child hits the age of 5, it is important to take them to a pediatric ophthalmologist for a thorough checkup if they are suffering from any vision concerns or have a family history of vision concerns. If Your Child Has Myopia, We Can Help! What many don’t realize is that myopia can seriously affect a child’s future eye health and vision. Having myopia in childhood significantly increases the risk of developing serious eye diseases and conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and macular degeneration in adulthood. The good news is that myopia can be effectively managed to reduce the risk of future eye disease.

But how much do you really know about this progressive eye disease? Some parents expect that simply receiving a pair of glasses for their child is the only way of dealing with the effects of myopia. In truth, there’s much more to myopia and what you can do about it than meets the eye. Below, we’ll explore 4 facts about myopia that may inspire you to be more proactive about your child’s eye health and long term vision. Myopia is an Eye Disease Myopia is an eye disease where the eyeball grows too long, leading light to be focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Because the eye is elongated, incoming light doesn’t focus on the retina as it should, leading objects in the distance to appear blurry. As an example, If a normal eye is round like a basketball, a myopic eye would look more like a football. As this happens, the symptoms of the disease are blurry distance vision. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. To help combat this, we recommend eye exams every six months to track myopia progress. It’s More Common Than You Think Myopia is an eye disease of epidemic proportions, affecting close to 2 billion people worldwide. We are currently on pace to have half of the world’s population with some degree of myopia by the year 2050! Indoor time, excessive ‘near work’, and genetic factors all play a role in the growth of myopia. Education For Their Future Myopia generally begins in childhood and progresses throughout the school age years, usually stabilizing into the late teens. Because the eye grows in tandem with the body, it’s only natural that it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development when they experience growth spurts and suddenly require a higher prescription. There are ways to effectively treat myopia in order to prevent it from progressing as the child grows. Slowing myopia early on can make all the difference to your child’s eye health as they age. Myopia Puts Kids At Risk of Developing Future Eye Disease Myopic children are significantly more likely to develop sight threatening eye diseases and conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment later in life. Children with high myopia have a 50% higher risk of developing glaucoma, are 3 times more likely to develop cataracts, and 6 times more likely to develop retinal detachment as adults than children who don’t have myopia. Myopia is more than just a matter of clear vision a child’s eye health is at stake. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science noted that when parents provided their children with myopia management, the risks of developing myopic maculopathy fell by 40%.

Essentially, your child’s eye is growing too long. Because the eye elongates and grows with the rest of the body, naturally, it stops elongating once the rest of the body stops growing in early adulthood. This also means there may be times in a child’s development where they experience growth spurts suddenly requiring a higher prescription due to an increase in their myopia. It can affect both children and adults, with over 50% of American teenagers being myopic according to this journal. Here are some ways to recognize the signs and symptoms of myopia in children. Consistent Headaches Headaches can be a common system of vision problems, it is important to track how often your child is experiencing symptoms of headaches. Some headaches may be a result of allergy symptoms or pressure changes, but they could also be a direct result of nearsightedness. If your child is experiencing more than one headache per week, do schedule an appointment with an optometrist or pediatrician to try and get your vision checked for myopia. Excessive Eye Watering Excessive eye watering can also be a symptom of myopia, given that it can result in discomfort in the eyes. If your child experiences consistent and excessive eye watering, do schedule an appointment with an optometrist to get your vision checked. Excessive Squinting If your child is squinting excessively, it might also be a symptom of myopia. This is due to the fact that humans suffering from myopia squint as a result in changes in the tension of their eye muscles, providing them with brief clarity of vision. Thereby, it should be easy to spot individual suffering from nearsightedness if he or she engages in excessive squinting. Holding Objects Close to Their Face Another glaring symptom to look for if wondering is if your child constantly holds objects closer to their face to see them properly. This is a clear symptom of nearsightedness which may be caused by excessive usage of screen time. Consistent Rubbing Of Eyes When dealing with a young child that might potentially have myopia, they might often rub their eyes as a sign of discomfort. If you notice that your child excessively and consistently rubs their eyes, it might be a sign to schedule a consultation with the optometrist to have their vision assessed. Sitting Very Close to the TV You might find your child sitting too close to the TV than they normally do. The most apparent sign that your child may have myopia, especially for older kids, is if they grumble about the images on the TV screen looking unclear or blurry, or if they tell you they have issues reading the words shown on screens.

This is unfortunate as your eye health and visual acuity have a major impact on your overall well being and quality of life. . In today’s article, your trusted eye exam doctor from Lumen Optometric shares some simple eye health tips for young adults. Take a Break When Using Digital Devices Young adults tend to spend a lot of time on their digital devices. Unfortunately, staring at a computer or phone screen for too long can make the eyes feel dry and tired, eventually causing blurred vision. This is because people tend to blink less when staring at a digital screen. To avoid digital eye strain, you need to give your eyes frequent breaks. You can do this by following the 20 20 20 rule: after 20 minutes of screen time, look at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds to give your eyes a break. Practice Good Contact Lens Hygiene If you wear contact lenses, it’s critical to observe proper hygiene to avoid eye infections. Don’t sleep in your contact lenses and keep water away from your contacts. Use fresh contact lens disinfecting solution every time. Always wash your hands with soap and water and then dry them with a clean cloth before touching your contact lenses. Most importantly, follow your eye doctor’s recommendations about replacing your contact lenses. Don’t wear a pair of contact lenses beyond their scheduled replacement date. Lead a Healthy Lifestyle The three most important things you can do to safeguard your vision are maintaining a healthy diet, exercising often and avoiding smoking. Leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing eye diseases like age related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and diabetic retinopathy. You should also practice good sleeping habits. Lack of sleep can adversely affect your health in many ways.

In our technologically driven world, conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism are becoming increasingly prevalent among children. This article will unpack these conditions, helping you understand what they are, how they differ, and most importantly, what you can do to manage and treat them. The Differences Between Myopia and Astigmatism Myopia results when your eye grows too long from front to back, causing light to focus before it reaches the retina. If a normal eye is shaped like a basketball, then a myopic eye may more closely resemble a football. In contrast, astigmatism is usually due to an irregularly shaped cornea or lens. Myopia primarily affects distance vision, while astigmatism affects vision at all distances. Both conditions can coexist in one eye, and they often do. This combination can further complicate vision, making it crucial to address both issues. Combining Science and a Child Centric Approach At Treehouse Eyes®, we combine robust, science backed data with inspiring aesthetics for both children and parents alike. We’ve created an environment that children love, helping to alleviate the fear sometimes associated with medical appointments. Our team of experts provides thorough eye examinations using the latest technology, identifying refractive errors and other eye health issues early. We then create a personalized treatment plan that suits the needs and lifestyle of your child. Myopia and astigmatism are common eye conditions that can affect children of all ages. If your child has been diagnosed with either of these conditions, it’s important to seek early treatment to protect their vision and prevent further complications. Managing Myopia and Astigmatism with Treehouse Eyes® So, how can you protect your child’s vision if they’re diagnosed with myopia or astigmatism? Treehouse Eyes® is the first and only dedicated myopia management service provider in the United States.

If this is the case, you may feel relieved about this, but does it really mean you have perfect vision? To answer this, we’ll first explain the related vision terminology to help you understand how we measure your vision’s quality. Visual Acuity Visual acuity is the term used to express the clarity or sharpness of your vision. This is measured by your ability to identify the letters or numbers on a standardized eye chart while standing at a certain distance. So, for instance, if you have 20 20 vision, you can see clearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance. Similarly, if you have 20 100 vision, it must mean that you can see as close as 20 feet to see what those with 20 20 vision normally see at 100 feet. 20 20 vision doesn’t always mean your eyesight is perfect. For instance, if you’re getting nearsighted, we may recommend that you use our orthokeratology lenses to slow its progression. But then this only indicates how sharp and clear your vision is at a distance. There are also other vision skills that are just as important, such as eye coordination, side vision, focusing ability, color vision, and depth perception. The Snellen visual acuity system is named after the Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, who developed the system in 1862. The system uses acuity measurements in fractions of 20 20, 20 40, 20 60, and so on. The numerator or the top number of the Snellen fraction is the distance between the eye chart and the patient. In the U.S., the viewing distance is usually 20 feet while in other countries, it’s 6 meters. Meanwhile, the bottom number of the fraction corresponds to the visual acuity of the patient. Higher numbers mean less clarity and sharpness in eyesight. For instance, the Big “E” that you see in most Snellen eye charts corresponds to 20 200 visual acuity. If this is the only letter you can discern, then there’s a chance that you may be legally blind unless prescribed with corrective contact lenses. The Factors and Limits The major factors that determine visual acuity are as follows: 1\\\\. The accuracy of how the lens and cornea of the eye focuses light onto the retina 2\\\\. The sensitivity of the nerves in the retina and vision centers in the brain 3\\\\. The ability of the brain to interpret information received from the eyes Visual acuity tests are quite useful in measuring the clarity of your eyesight in standardized conditions, it’s not completely accurate in determining the overall quality of your vision. Some of its limitations are that it can’t measure how well you see colored objects, moving objects, or objects that are similar in brightness to their background.

Blog Information What Is The Difference Between Myopia and Hyperopia?What Is The Difference Between Myopia and Hyperopia? June 15, 2023 by Morris Ilagan When it comes to common vision disorders, myopia and hyperopia are often confused. In the article, we’ll dive deep into these distinct vision impairments, understand their distinctive characteristics, and explore current treatment modalities. Understanding Myopia and Hyperopia Myopia, also referred to as nearsightedness, is a vision condition whose symptoms are blurry distance vision. This is a result of the eye growing too long from front to back leading to blurry vision when looking at faraway objects. On the other hand, hyperopia, or farsightedness, is the opposite. Distant objects are clear, but those up close appear blurry. This condition occurs when the eye is too short from front to back, or the cornea is too flat, leading to light focusing behind the retina. Diagnosis and Differences The diagnosis of both conditions involves scheduling a routine eye exam – especially one trained to spot myopia like the doctors at Treehouse Eyes. These exams include visual acuity tests, refraction assessments, and eye health evaluations. Be sure that your eyecare provider is measuring your child’s axial length to ensure an accurate diagnosis of myopia. Axial length will measure how long the eye is front to back. Notably, the critical difference between myopia and hyperopia lies in their distinct symptoms and the way they affect vision. People with myopia often have difficulty viewing road signs, and whiteboards, or watching a movie at a cinema or at home. In contrast, those with hyperopia may struggle with tasks like reading, using a smartphone, doing homework, and other times where closer vision is necessary. Treatment Modalities Fortunately, both myopia and hyperopia are manageable with several treatment options. The key for both, but especially myopia, is early detection and treatment. Myopia is a disease that typically develops in children (ages 6 – 12) and continues through puberty until the child stops growing. This can sometimes be well into adulthood (25 years old in some cases) which is why early treatment and prevention are key to slowing or stopping the progression of myopia. For children, orthokeratology, or Ortho K, is a potential treatment. It involves the use of specially designed gas permeable contact lenses that temporarily reshape the cornea to help treat your childs myopia. Recent studies suggest that certain types of multifocal contact lenses may slow the progression of myopia in children. Furthermore, low dose atropine eye drops have shown promising results in minimizing the advancement of myopia. Conclusion Understanding the differences between myopia and hyperopia is vital in recognizing the need for a timely eye exam and appropriate treatment. Through modern optometry, children are now able to receive the treatment and care they need to improve their vision and quality of life. Remember, regular eye examinations are critical to detect any visual impairments at an early stage.

Still, it can also bring a host of changes to your vision. As the hormones in your body change and fluctuate during this period, you may experience various eye related issues that can affect how clearly you see or make your eyes uncomfortable It’s good to be aware of these common changes and take steps to protect your vision throughout pregnancy. Common Vision Changes During Pregnancy Here’s what you can expect: Dry Eyes – Many women experience dry eyes during pregnancy due to hormonal fluctuations. It usually happens around mid pregnancy when hormone levels are at their highest point and decreases after delivery as hormone levels return to normal. Blurry Vision – During pregnancy, it is not uncommon for women’s eyesight to become blurry or cloudy due to their changing hormones. It should resolve itself once their hormone levels return to normal after childbirth. Light Sensitivity – Some pregnant women find themselves more sensitive than usual when exposed to bright lights, such as sunlight or fluorescent lighting in stores or office buildings, which can cause discomfort. Floaters – Small spots may appear in front of one’s field of vision, known as floaters. These tend to increase with age but may temporarily worsen during pregnancy because many people become dehydrated while expecting a baby. Glaucoma – Women with a family history of glaucoma are at higher risk for developing it during the later stages of their pregnancies, so regular checkups with an optometrist will help ensure that any potential problems are caught early on before causing further damage.

If you’d like to improve your vision with high quality contact lenses, our skilled eye care specialists can help. Complete Contact Lens Exams Lumen Optometric completes in depth contact exams.

Using the latest technology and training, we can measure your eye surface and eye moisture levels to determine the correct size, type and prescription to best fit your health and lifestyle needs. Benefits of Contact Lenses Clarity. Like glasses, contact lenses improve vision by using light and refraction. But while eyeglasses can obstruct your peripheral vision, contact lenses conform to your eyes to offer a wider field of view. Ease. Contact lenses don’t get in the way of an active lifestyle. Patients who exercise, play sports or like to be outside often feel less encumbered when wearing contact lenses. Versatility. Some patients prefer the way they look with contact lenses. Glasses can change the appearance of your face and may clash with certain outfits or colors, but contacts offer complete versatility. Improved eye health. Specialized contacts can even reshape your cornea while you sleep! Orthokeratology lenses slow the progression of nearsighted vision, and Lumen Optometric is the only eye doctor in Los Angeles County to fit custom, doctor designed lenses.

Our historic scheduling practices align well with COVID prevention measures. ● Our doors will be locked, but we’re open! Just knock or call us at Negative Pressure Exam Rooms (Updated 7.27.2020) ● Our exam rooms are set up as negative pressure rooms, meaning that the air in those rooms is being pulled up and out into the environment.

As the only neurolens treatment provider in the San Gabriel Valley, Lumen Optometric customizes state of the art lenses that bring clarity and comfort to patients suffering from migraines, neck strain, tired eyes and more. Our goal is to help your eyes and head feel less tortured at the end of the day, so if you suffer from any of the following symptoms, Lumen Optometric can help: > How Neurolens Therapy Works Your brain is constantly in communication with your two eyes, keeping them aligned and in sync to help you see the world without double vision. If your eyes are misaligned, however, your brain struggles to maintain balance. Without this balance, you could experience constant headaches, migraines, tension in and around your eyes, dizziness and even neck stiffness. Add misalignment to the strenuous demands that computer screens, phones and other digital devices place on your visual system, and you could face daily suffering. Fortunately, 10 years of research into headaches and their associated visual symptoms has yielded the revolutionary neurolens treatment. Neurolens therapy helps correct misalignment at the distance where you need the most help. Whether you struggle to see far away or up close, Lumen Optometric can provide customized neurolenses that correct your specific misalignment and give you the most comfortable vision possible. Lumen Optometric is proud to offer this exciting new technology and we’d love to help you discover relief for your symptoms! Check out the following video for a neurolens overview, and then read on for answers to some of the FAQs we receive. Neurolens FAQ What makes this any different than the glasses I wore in the past? The difference is in the technology and the visual experience. Neurolenses utilize patented, clinically tested technology to correct your misalignment at your prescribed working distance. There is no lens on the market that offers the same technology. And Lumen Optometric keeps several sets of neurolens prescriptions on hand, so if you are a candidate for a neurolens treatment, you’ll have the opportunity to see and feel the neurolens difference at the end of your exam! How do you measure my misalignment? Lumen Optometric utilizes a sophisticated instrument called the SightSync to measure your eye misalignment at varying distances. Coupled with specialized in office testing, your eye measurements allow us to create a lens that helps with your specific symptoms. How quickly can I expect my symptoms to improve? Most Lumen Optometric patients notice an improvement within the week, although patients with extremely chronic conditions may require six to eight weeks to notice an improvement. Are there any side effects to the neurolenses? First time neurolens wearers typically report feeling lighter, as if there’s less burden on their heads, necks, shoulders and eyes. But, as with any new type of lens, you may feel disoriented for about a week as your brain adapts. Schedule an Evaluation Today If you work on the computer for a good chunk of the day, suffer from migraines or experience dry eyes, let Lumen Optometric put relief in sight. We’re the only eye clinic in the San Gabriel Valley to offer neurolens treatment technology. In fact, we’re only the sixtieth clinic in the world to offer the neurolens!

It’s possible with Orthokeratology (Ortho K) from Lumen Optometric. Ortho K is an FDA approved, non surgical treatment that corrects your vision by gently reshaping your eyes while you sleep. In the morning, you simply remove your custom Ortho K lenses and experience clear vision all day! ORTHOKERATOLOGY FOR ADULTS: One of the biggest breakthroughs in correcting your myopia (aka nearsightedness) or hyperopia (aka farsightedness) is a process called Orthokeratology, or Ortho K, for short. It is a revolutionary system that accomplishes three things it corrects your vision while you sleep, removes the need for daytime distance glasses contacts, and allows you to avoid dryness, irritation, or allergies with traditional contacts. HOW IT KEEPS YOUR EYES HEALTHY: Relative to wearing soft contacts, which are worn for a period of 12 18 hours a day, Ortho K lenses are only worn while you sleep, so the overall wear time is much less. Additionally, these lenses are only worn under clean conditions (you’re at home!) so there’s much less of a chance of allergies and virus bacterial deposits. HOW IT GIVES YOU CLEAR VISION: You wear a special retainer like lens to sleep and upon waking, you remove the lenses. When the lenses are off, you will be able to see clearly for the rest of the day. Glasses or traditional contacts will never have to be worn again for the distance so long as you wear your Ortho K lenses to bed every night. Depending on your needs for reading, Ortho K can be modified to enhance your reading vision, but reading glasses might still be needed depending on your age and intensity of your near work. WHAT ELSE MAKES ORTHO K UNIQUE? Ortho K is only worn while in the comfort and cleanliness of your own home so you will never have to worry about losing breaking tearing glasses contacts while at work or participating in sports. It is a great option for farsighted patients who are having trouble adapting to wearing glasses. Additionally, it is also a wonderful option for athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, or patients with dry eyes or severe allergies who can no longer tolerate soft contact lenses.

There are no age requirements. I HAVE MYOPIA (aka NEARSIGHTEDNESS) WHAT IT MEANS: You were prescribed glasses for the distance (driving, TV, anything greater than a couple feet away). At a certain prescription, you see better up close without your glasses contacts. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t need to put on glasses to see in the distance any longer! *For those of you who are myopic but need reading help with progressive lenses, Ortho K can also be built with a reading enhancement to aid with reading. I HAVE ASTIGMATISM IT’S COMPLICATED: Astigmatism can occur with both myopia and hyperopia WHAT IT MEANS: You see slightly distortion and shadows without your glasses, which you might wear for both distance and near. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t experience the distortion nor shadows! I HAVE HYPEROPIA (AKA FARSIGHTEDNESS) Farsightedness is more complicated, it breaks down into two categories (simplified for this web format) CATEGORY 1: You’re farsighted and only have trouble with reading. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has been fairly clear for your whole life, but upon landing in your 40 50s, you find that you now need reading glasses. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: You won’t need reading glasses for most tasks and your distance will likely subtly improve. CATEGORY 2: You’re farsighted and have trouble with both reading and the distance. YOUR EXPERIENCE: Vision has been clear up until your 30 40s, but now you need glasses for both distance and near. HOW ORTHO K CAN HELP: This scenario is the most life changing for patients! Ortho k essentially reverses your visual experience by about 20 years, back to a time when you were able to wake up seeing 100% clear. Other eye health factors need to be taken into account before initiating Orthokeratology. During an Ortho K consult, one of our doctors will review your complete visual and systemic health to ensure you’re a good candidate.

Candidacy Our Technology Frequently Asked Questions Adult vs. Children’s Designs Eye Exams Contact Lens Exams Patient Center Appointment & Forms COVID 19 Protocols Videos About Us Office Testimonials Blog Frequently Asked Questions Orthokeratology Frequently Asked Questions Below are the top ten most frequently asked questions. We have a longer list that can be emailed as well. I just have to sleep in these lenses to see clearly? Yes, the lenses gently mold your eyes while you sleep. As long as you sleep in the lenses for a continuous 6 8 hours, your vision will reach full, waking hour clarity within a 1 2 week time frame. So what do I wear in the meantime in those first 1 2 weeks? During your transition period and depending on the size type of your prescription, you will be given soft contacts or loaner glasses to ease the transition. What can I expect during the first 1 2 weeks? Your vision will become clearer day by day, and the clarity will last longer and longer with each passing day. But during the first couple of weeks, your vision will go from clear to your original level of blurriness by the day’s end. The period of blurriness decreases with each day until full clarity is reached. How does the lens feel? The lens is made with a more rigid material, so initially it’s more noticeable and requires a little more adaptation. The good news is that since the lenses are inserted right before bedtime, most of the adaptation takes place while you sleep! How long does the Ortho K effect last after the initial transition period? The vision correcting effect is programmed to last for ~24 hours, but some patients can experience clear vision for 36 hours without having to rewear the lens. How long your vision remains clear after 24 hours depends on the size of your prescription. Is vision clear while I’m wearing the Ortho k lenses? Yes, vision is very clear with the lenses on. They are designed not only to mold the cornea, but to also give you clear vision if you have to wake up in the middle of the night (for the restroom, emergency evacuations, etc). What happens if I miss a night? Patients with lower prescriptions don’t notice an obvious difference the next day, but patients with higher prescriptions will notice blurriness in the distance. Computer tasks for patients are definitely workable if you miss a night, but night driving is not recommended. Soft contacts can be given to you to make up for any residual blur. What happens if I decide to stop Ortho K? Your vision returns to normal over 2 3 weeks, sometimes faster. Are there any side effects to Ortho K? Glare is the primary side effect, which occurs with any refractive procedure such as LASIK PRK SMILE etc as well. Glare tends to be more noticeable in the initial adaptation period, which lasts 1 2 months. After that period, the brain learns to adapt and filter out residual glare. I thought it was unhealthy to sleep in contacts? Patients are told not to sleep in traditional contacts because they’re worn throughout the day, throughout sleep, and again in the daytime for a minimum of at least 30 hours of wear time. Additionally, debris germs mucus accumulate on traditional lenses, which your eye is then exposed to for the 30+ hours of wear. With Ortho K, you only wear them for a period of 7 8 hours maximum while under clean, home conditions.

Orthokeratology How’s Ortho K Work? Ortho K works somewhat similarly to a retainer for teeth in that they are worn overnight, but the similarities stop there. Ortho K works by gently reshaping the front surface of the eye (the cornea) while you sleep. The retainer lenses are inserted right before bedtime and removed after waking. Because the lenses are designed to correct your vision overnight, you will wake up with vision that will remain clear throughout your waking hours. The lenses are then re worn nightly to maintain clear vision. Recent advances in technology have allowed us to design Ortho K lenses that are created 100% from the shape of your eye. The custom nature of the lens allows for a healthier fitment.

It’s also why other optometrists in the San Gabriel Valley bring their children to Lumen Optometric to be fit with our custom Ortho K lenses! To maintain healthy Ortho k wear, we take great lengths to educate our patients on the proper care of your eyes and the Ortho k lenses. After all, these are your eyes that we’ve promised to keep healthy! With personal, one on one training, we teach all our Ortho k patients an easy to follow routine and they all do very well. If this was not the case, we certainly would not be fitting our own friends and family in this technology!

Medmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300” being the gold standard topographer for over a decade. Their newest topographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more accurately capturing your cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your eye, which yields faster, healthier, and clearer outcomes. WAVE CUSTOM LENS DESIGN Lumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles County that employs WAVE to create 100% fully custom lenses for your eyes. WAVE combines all the topographical (corneal shape) data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and manipulate every aspect of your lens design. Custom design software is extremely critical for both clarity and eye health because each point of the lens is based on information from your cornea. Tip for inquiring patients – If you are told that you’re being fitted with custom lenses, ask to see your design. It should look similar to the screenshot above. If a doctor touts that they’re fitting a custom lens but is unable to show you a screenshot like the above where they can manipulate every aspect of every curve, they’re not designing a custom lens. All doctors will refer to their lenses as custom, but it is actually quite rare because of the difficult training, complicated CAD software, and cutting edge equipment that is required.

Scleral lenses are specialty, custom molded lenses that bring clear and comfortable vision to patients with corneal issues such as keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, or post LASIK complications. If your vision and comfort are lacking because of these complications, don’t settle. Sclerals represent the gold standard keratoconus treatment that is non surgical. Dr. Eric To is the only practice owning optometrist in Los Angeles County that is recognized as a Fellow of the Scleral Lens Society. We’d love for you to experience effortless vision, so reach out and let Lumen Optometric restore clarity and comfort to your vision. Scleral FAQs As a leading scleral optometrist, Lumen Optometric has the information you need. To give our valued patients more detailed insight about scleral lenses, we’ve compiled a convenient list of FAQs. What are scleral lenses? Scleral lenses are large diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (the clear window of the eye) and gently rest on the sclera (the white, outer layer of the eye). The rigid nature of the lenses makes your vision extremely crisp. Scleral lenses should not be confused with traditional gas permeable (GP) lenses. Traditional GP lenses are small lenses made of durable plastic that sit on the extremely sensitive cornea. Conversely, scleral lenses tend to be much more comfortable because they settle on the less sensitive sclera. Who is a candidate for scleral lenses? Many patients can benefit from scleral lenses, especially those suffering from: Keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration Higher prescriptions & visual needs that aren’t met by glasses or soft contacts Dry eyes, with or without soft contacts Glare distortion after LASIK, PRK or corneal transplants Exacting visual demands from things like sports, videography & photography Will I see a difference between scleral lenses and soft contact lenses? Scleral lens prescriptions offer greater vision and comfort than soft contact lenses because: Scleral lenses are built from highly customizable materials that offer the clearest, most stable vision correction. Scleral lenses sit on the less sensitive part of the eye and are inherently more stable. Scleral lenses offer options that make them more customizable for full distance clarity or for improved reading vision. Do all eye doctors fit scleral lenses? Not all eye doctors fit scleral lenses, but Lumen Optometric specializes in advanced scleral fitting! Our talented scleral optometrist uses an sMap3D instrument to capture a full 3D representation of your frontal eye. That custom scan helps us build a Scleral 2.0 lens that accurately fits your eye. Lumen Optometric is the only provider in the San Gabriel Valley to offer this state of the art technology, and we liken the process to creating a 100% custom made suit. Like a tailor designing a suit based on every measurement of your body, Lumen Optometric creates a scleral lens that is more accurate and a healthier fit for your eyes. What is a Scleral 2.0 lens? Traditional sclerals, or scleral 1.0 lenses, have been used for roughly a decade. The newer, more technologically advanced Scleral 2.0 lenses are customized specifically for your eye. So while creating a Scleral 2.0 lens is comparable to designing a custom made suit, fitting scleral 1.0 lenses is similar to modifying an off the rack suit: you select a suit size that approximates your body shape and make a limited number of adjustments to help the suit drape over your body’s contours. Our mission at Lumen Optometric is to aim for a flawless fit with your scleral lenses, not a best guess approximation. Check out these videos to see what a difference customized scleral lenses can make! What’s it like to be fit with Scleral 2.0 lenses? An advanced scleral lens fitting starts with both corneal and scleral topography. A corneal topographer maps the cornea, the clear window of the eye. Scleral topography is a separate, dedicated instrument that can scan the elevation changes of your eye’s white surface. This painless procedure does not require dilation drops, but it does require the use of a temporary dye that enhances our scans. We then place a calibrated “test” scleral lens on your eye. That test lens gives you an opportunity to try out a scleral lens and gives us time to fine tune your prescription. Once your prescription data is obtained, it’s combined with the shape data to create your fully customized scleral lens. Please note that during a scleral lens consultation, we take all necessary measurements of your eye. Be prepared to set aside 60 minutes of eye doctor time to ensure that the measurements are correct. What is the best keratoconus treatment for me? Or if I have pellucid marginal degeneration or any other condition where the cornea is no longer consistent in its shape (post LASIK RK corneal transplant), how will sclerals help me? Sclerals are the best keratoconus treatment available, they’re the gold standard! They will give you clear, distortion free vision. Think of an irregular cornea as the warped windshield of a car. That warping distorts what you see through the windshield, leading to extreme glare in addition to distorted vision. When you fill a custom scleral lens with conditioning solution and apply it to your eye, the solution “mates” the scleral with your cornea to give you a new, smooth, regular surface to see through. This perfectly contoured surface cancels out your distortion and blur, leaving you with clear and comfortable vision. The outcomes are the same for keratoconus, pellucid, or any other type of corneal irregularity. If I’m already wearing glasses or contacts and I see acceptably, will scleral lenses make a difference? That depends on how you define acceptable. Most people are fairly adaptable to the options they’re given, so until you’re shown a difference, you may not be aware that the potential for improvement exists. For example, if you’ve been wearing the same set of contacts for nearly a decade, there’s a good chance you’re missing out on clearer, healthier and more comfortable technology. Lumen Optometric can keep you up to date on the best and healthiest options for your only set of eyes. The impact of scleral lenses also depends on your prescription. If you have an extremely minimal prescription, scleral lenses will be more helpful in correcting dry eyes or performance based vision. If you have a moderate or high prescription with astigmatism, the benefit of sclerals will be vision that’s clearer and more stable. Visual stability is something many of us take for granted until we are shown what true stability looks like. For example, consider the fluidity of the newer 120hz televisions relative to their older 60hz counterparts. 60hz televisions looked normal to us until the 120hz upgrades were released. When patients have high levels of astigmatism, scleral lenses provide results similar to that of seeing an image on a brand new, high definition television for the first time! Corneal health is another factor to consider. If you have any corneal issues, scleral lenses will significantly impact your vision and improve your quality of life. If my eyes are dry, how can sclerals help me? When you apply a scleral lens to your eye, the “bowl” of the lens is filled with sterile conditioning solution. This conditioning solution is held against your eye for as long as you wear the lens, creating a moisture chamber that helps alleviate your dry eye. Of course, scleral lenses represent only one treatment modality within a greater dry eye treatment system. Severely chronic dry eye patients may need additional treatments to overcome their dryness symptoms, and Lumen Optometric has several dry eye treatment plans available.

Researchers believe that the environment kids grow up in today, with too many close distance activities (like reading and device use) and lack of outdoor play, is contributing to the rapid increase in childhood myopia. While glasses and contact lenses compensate for a child’s blurry vision, they don’t stop your child’s vision from continuing to deteriorate. As children grow, myopia often develops as they reach school age and progresses into their late teens or early twenties. The Dangers of Myopia Researchers now know there is more to worry about with myopic eyes than the inconvenience of ever thickening lenses. Scientific evidence has proven that myopic patients are more vulnerable to a range of sight threatening diseases and complications. In fact, myopia is the sixth leading cause of blindness. Patients with mild myopia have a four fold increase in the risk of retinal detachment. For those with moderate to severe myopia, the risk increases ten times. One study concluded that more than 50 percent of retinal detachments not related to trauma are associated with myopia. Other myopia risks include glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration. Myopia Can Be Managed The dangers of myopia, in conjunction with the normal challenges of subpar vision, mean it is important for parents of myopic children to manage the condition as part of your child’s eye health. The goal of myopia management is to slow the progression of myopia and reduce its impact on your child’s life. The younger myopia management begins, the more effective the treatment. We are excited at Lumen Optometric to announce the launch of our children’s myopia management service in partnership with Treehouse Eyes®, the country’s leading myopia management service. The revolutionary system, designed to treat your child’s myopia and significantly reduce the threat of more serious eye diseases, is one of the most important innovations since glasses were first prescribed hundreds of years ago!

TREEHOUSE EYES® MYOPIA MANAGEMENT FOR CHILDREN Is myopia unhealthy? SO WHY DID THE SCREEN MOVE FURTHER BACK WITH MYOPIC PATIENTS? This is due to the whole eye growing longer in depth, which occurs in myopic patients. This front to back elongation moves the retina (the screen) beyond the point where the cornea (the projector) expects to concentrate its light to a focus. SO WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? When the outer shell of the eye (the sclera) elongates, it forces all the internal components that line the inside of the eye (the retina) to also stretch. There are two problems with an enlarged eye and a stretched retina: Problem #1 – A nuisance Your child has to wear stronger glasses contacts every time their prescription increases. They become dependent on glasses contacts from the moment their eyes open in the morning to when their eyes close for bedtime. Problem #2 – A health concern The stretched retina is thinned and weakened, which leads to a higher risk of blinding eye diseases, such as myopic maculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts.

IS IT NATURE OR NURTURE? The bad news: there is a clear connection between parents passing their nearsighted genes to their children. The good news: your genetics are not entirely to blame! Even though myopic inheritance has been established, the steep rise in myopia over the past 50 60 years cannot be due to inheritance alone. In the graph above, you will notice that in the 1940s, the prevalence of myopia in this select group of East Asian university students was 10% to 37%. If you fast forward to the present, the prevalence is staggering; it is over 80% to 90%! It is impossible for such a sudden shift to have occurred in the gene pool of those nations so the cause cannot be genetics alone. In looking for the cause of this progression, researchers studied the visual demands of those university students. It was demonstrated that the average student in Shanghai was responsible for 15 hours of homework per week, compared to 6 hours per week in the United States. Even though the prevailing thought that excessive close work leads to more myopia, they found something else more interesting. They found that it was the lack of outdoor time that led to an earlier and more rapid nearsighted progression! One thing that is clear based on the epidemiological studies, and it is that genetics alone cannot account for this explosive myopic epidemic. ARE ELECTRONIC DEVICES HARMING MY CHILD’S EYES? The answer is a complicated “yes.” The logic of excessive screen time worsening vision is sound, but there has been no conclusive evidence that screen time alone contributes to myopic progression. What is known is that with every moment our children are spending time indoors with their eyes glued to screens, they are not spending those moments outdoors. This is where science has stepped in to find a strong correlation between outdoor playtime and the slowed or delayed onset of myopia. Children who spend a couple of hours outdoors every day have been found to be four times less likely to become myopic. Our stance when it comes to screen time is both scientifically driven and rooted in common sense. Being outdoors provides the healthy sunlight our eyes and skin need. It’s also fantastic for both physical and visual development. Being less sedentary and more active outdoors enforces better hand eye coordination, depth perception, and eye coordination skills. All efforts should be made to reduce screen time when possible for these reasons.

Zeiss IOLMaster Optical Biometer An optical biometer is traditionally used by surgeons to perform power calculations for lenses that are to be implanted in the eye. We utilize optical biometry for a different reason: to measure the length of your child’s eye, which is referred to as axial length. As your child grows, their eyes grow as well. Our goal is early detection and differentiation between natural growth of the eye versus accelerated myopic progression. Since a longer eye leads to a stretched retina (which has its own complications as seen in the “Is Myopia Unhealthy” page), it’s critical that we know the rate at which your child’s eyes are growing. Previously, the only known method to monitor the eye’s growth was through the prescription, but each prescription does not correlate with a specific eye length. Typically, prescription changes lag axial length changes, which means that if you only monitor through prescription, chances are that you will miss length changes that may have already occurred. Treehouse Eyes affiliates such as our office are one of the few offices in all of Los Angeles County that employ technology solely to measure axial length for children. Medmont Meridia Corneal Topographer A leading edge topographer is critical to monitor how the cornea (the clear window of the eye) changes over time with myopia treatments. Medmont is hailed as the leading manufacturer of topographers, with the model “E300” being the gold standard topographer for a decade. Their newest topographer, the Meridia, improves upon the original E300 model by more accurately capturing your child’s cornea in three dimensions. Increased topographical accuracy leads to custom lenses that more closely resemble your child’s eye, which yields faster and better outcomes. Medmont partnered with Lumen Optometric to help launch the new gold standard and we’re proud to be able to offer this latest form of technology to our patients. WAVE Custom Lens Design Lumen Optometric is the only office in Los Angeles county that employs WAVE to create 100% fully custom lenses for your child. WAVE combines all the topographical data from the Medmont Meridia and allows us to specify and manipulate every aspect of your child’s lens design. From a doctor’s perspective, the customizable nature of WAVE allows for (1) maximum myopia management, (2) more accurate vision correction, (3) increasing the level of myopia protection in a lens. For patients, it simply means their eyes are more protected from myopic progression, they see better and arrive at a clear endpoint in less time. Aren’t All Lenses Custom? Depending on the type of lens a practitioner may be limited to (either due to technology or training), their definition of custom will differ. This is an overview of the three different types of “custom” lenses you will encounter as a patient parent. Basic custom – These types of ortho k lenses are similar to off the rack suits in that they come in a predefined size. Depending on your needs, the suit is then upsized or downsized to another predefined size. “Basic custom” ortho k lenses exist in certain parameters and different lenses are selected based on visual estimation. Due to the lack of true personalization, your child can share the same lens design as another patient. Semi custom – This category of ortho k lenses begins to incorporate technology such as topography in the design of the lens. Lens design software will use the topographical data to generate a lens off of an pre established template. To return to the suit analogy, measurements are taken for a suit to be made, but the suits still have certain non modifiable assumptions made about the proportions. And if a suit has to be modified, you still operate within those non modifiable template assumptions. Fully custom – WAVE lenses are all fully custom designs. WAVE lenses incorporate topographical data of the eye which can then be fully manipulated by a Certified WAVE Designer (CWD). Every aspect of the lens can be changed relative to one another, leading to the most form fitting and visually effective lens. We utilize WAVE lenses because our patients see the best out of them! Tip – If a doctor can’t show you the visual layout of your child’s lens design with numerical readouts of those design elements, it’s likely not a fully custom lens. If you point to any one aspect of the design and ask for it to be changed in real time for demonstration, yet it can’t, it’s likely not a fully custom lens. Lastly, fully custom lenses are all doctor designed from start to finish, meaning that the lenses are all designed in house by the same doctor taking care of your child. Basic or semi custom lens designers outsource their change requests to lens consultants. Fully custom lenses require more training to design and troubleshoot, in addition to requiring very specific hardware. We only fit fully custom lenses because they are the healthiest option for your child. Schedule a Consultation to Discuss Lumen Optometric offers consultations to discuss myopia management.

TREEHOUSE EYES® MYOPIA MANAGEMENT FOR CHILDREN What is myopia? WHAT IS MYOPIA & WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT PROGRESSES? When your child is myopic (which leads to nearsightedness), it means that distant objects are blurrier than near objects. To understand why this occurs, let’s first consider how a perfect eye works. Consider when conditions are perfect: When light passes through the clear, front window of the eye (cornea), it is focused on the inner lining of the eye (retina). Here’s an analogy (Figure 1): think of the cornea as a movie projector, with the retina as a projector screen. The projector and the screen are 20 feet apart, and the projector casts its image 20 feet away onto the screen. The result is a clear image. Consider when the conditions are imperfect: A nearsighted eye is longer, which causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it, leading to a blurry image (Figure 2). Imagine the projector casting an image 20 feet away, but with the projector screen now sitting 25 feet away, which leads to a blurry, out of focus picture.
