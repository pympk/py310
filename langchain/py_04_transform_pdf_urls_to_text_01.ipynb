WILL I SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCLERAL AND SOFT LENSES? Scleral lenses are built from highly- customizable, firm lens materials, which offer clearer vision relative to the standard soft lenses. Example: consider how vision is better through a window versus clear, flexible plastic sheeting. CAN SCLERALS BE WORN THE WHOLE DAY? They can be worn for the full course of the day. Some patients may need to remove and clean the lenses mid day to maintain the best possible comfort and vision. WILL THEY HELP WITH MY DRY EYES? The moisture chamber under the scleral lens will greatly diminish dryness, leading to much more comfortable vision. HOW LONG DOES A SCLERAL LENS LAST? A set of scleral lenses should be replaced every 18- 24 months to maintain healthy vision, comfort, and to avoid lens warpage.ARE SCLERAL LENSES COMFORTABLE? Yes! The lenses are larger so they rest gently on the sclera and the edges are tucked under the eyelid. A well-fitting scleral lens is just as comfortable and less dry than soft contacts. SCLERAL LENSES DONE RIGHT AT LUMEN OPTOMETRIC! First, we start with a topographical scan of the cornea, which allows us to capture the curvature of your eye. We then customize the scleral lens for each individual eye, factoring in the prescription, all while ensuring that the lens rests gently and comfortably on the sclera. Once the lens is designed, we confirm that we’ve met both your visual and comfort demands. Our scleral lens fitting is not complete until you are completely pleased with the results. TO GET STARTED, SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH US AT WWW.LUMENOPTOMETRIC.COM FOR A COMPLIMENTARY CONSULTATION WHERE WE’LL EXPLAIN THE SCLERAL FITTING PROCESS IN MORE DETAIL.WHAT ARE SCLERAL LENSES? Scleral lenses are large diameter lenses that create a moisture chamber over the cornea (clear window of the eye) and gently settle on the sclera (white covering of the eye).WHAT ARE THEIR ADVANTAGES? Clear, stable vision due to the rigid lens design. Increased comfort from the lens resting on the less-sensitive sclera. Decreased dry eye from all- day lubrication of the cornea. WHO CAN HELP? Patients with keratoconus, pellucid, post-surgical glare/blur, compromised corneal integrity (dry eyes, recurrent erosions), high prescriptions, & exacting visual demands (photography, videography, sports).', metadata={'source': 'https://www.lumenoptometric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intro_ScleralLenses.pdf', 'page': 1})]"
