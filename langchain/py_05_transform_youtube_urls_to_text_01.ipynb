       "[Document(page_content=\"Hey Anthony, how's your day going? It's going good. Alright. So we have you fit in the S-MAP lenses, the specialty Slero lenses at this point, fully custom for your eye. So tell me a little bit more about them. What do you love the most about your new Slero lenses? Well, I love that they're very comfortable actually. They fit really well. My eyes don't feel so dry. I really like that. Great. Okay. And then tell us what happens when, or what you're feeling when you had your glasses on before, before the Sleros. Before, my vision was real blurry. It was like double or triple. I couldn't focus on anything on my left eye. It was just really hard to see, especially in low lighting. Gotcha. Yeah. So things definitely cleaned up with the Sleros for you then, huh? Oh, definitely. Especially in the left eye, everything's real sharp now. I can see a lot better. I don't feel so strained. Yeah. It's a big difference. Good. Okay. And then what about the whole fitting process? What did you appreciate the most? I love the personability. The way you guys interacted with me. I made sure I was comfortable the whole time. You checked everything multiple times, asked me how it felt. I really appreciated that. It made me feel real comfortable. Gotcha. You're super easy to work with. We appreciate it.

Yeah, Irma used to wear a previous type of SLARO lens, and now when it comes to the SLARO lenses, she's wearing the S-MAP, so they're fully mapped to her eye, and so we were able to get her there in, usually, probably a little fewer visits compared to in the past with her standard SLARO lenses, and so, so vision's clear for you at this point? Yes. Yeah, yeah. I can drive better. Excellent, yeah, and a little safer for you overall in the daytime, okay, and then when you insert them, do you find that it's a little bit easier, more comfortable, too, because of the size of the lenses? Yes, they're smaller than the ones I had. Good, okay, I'm glad. So overall, two thumbs up for you? Yes. Are you happy? Yes, they're very good.

       " Document(page_content=\"Hey everybody, it's Dr. To from Lumen Optometric and I'm just checking in to make sure that you guys are still doing well, staying healthy out there. And so I'm recording this today just to make sure that we have a little bit more clarity in terms of contact lenses. I've been seeing some news reports that mention that contact lenses aren't healthy to wear during times of the COVID pandemic. And I just want to make sure that everybody knows that there's absolutely no scientific basis, there's no studies that point towards any contact lens wear being unhealthy. And so there's some very specific guidelines to follow to make sure that you're wearing contact lenses in a healthy manner. And so most of these we've gone over with you in training or after you've worn contacts just as a quick touch point. And so one thing is to make sure your eyes washing your hands, okay, so 20 seconds is what we're aiming for here, I'd say a good solid 10 seconds of soaping, 10 seconds of rinsing and drying your hands very well, then and only then should you handle your lenses in the morning. So place them in and the rest of the day, as long as you're not touching your eyes or your face, then you'll be perfectly fine. In terms of disinfection, you have to make sure that you're disinfecting them well too. So most of the times we prefer the peroxide based solution, cleansers, and so usually you'll have a little case and you'll fill it with a solution that has a red cap and after six hours, it'll be completely disinfected. So if you're wearing lenses that you discard every two weeks or every month, or if you're wearing corneal reshaping lenses, you definitely want to make sure you're continuously cleaning your lenses every night or throughout the day, depending on how you wear your lenses. Now for daily disposables, when you do remove them at the end of the day, make sure again, your hands are clean, but you would just discard those lenses, okay? So again, so long as you're keeping your hands clean and you're disinfecting your lenses, there's nothing to worry about in terms of wearing your contact lenses. Again, if you have any questions, give us a call or you can email us or text us on our main line. You can find all that information on our website and hopefully we'll get to see you guys soon. It's been almost about a month that we've closed our doors temporarily. We really miss all of you and so take care and take care of one another, okay?

I had really extreme eye fatigue to the point where I couldn't even drive anymore, and I was getting really scared that it was going to be forever. I would have extremely gritty feeling in my eyes. I would have to drive with one eye closed and then switch to the other eye. I would go through bottles of drops in a couple of weeks, and of course headaches and back aches, but really primarily I just felt like my eyes were in total pain, like I had a rubber band wrapped around them, and there was a whole bunch of sand in there. It was very painful. So good news now. It doesn't feel that way anymore, huh? Yeah. It's a huge difference, really huge. I can drive again. I was saying that one of my triggers was being in a dark room with lit screens, which was terrible for work meetings. I would sit in those meetings with my eyes closed, and people would think I was bored or tired. It was very embarrassing. I had to explain it to everybody, but I had a big test where I was at a conference for a whole week like this, and it was pretty great. I could go the whole day at the conference without problems. Yeah, that's wonderful. I mean, being able to do what you need to do without having all that discomfort, it really adds up. You think about the little bits of discomfort throughout the day, and you stretch it out over 8 to 10, 12 hours, and then it really starts adding up. I'm in animal care, and quality of life is something we discuss a lot, and my quality of life was pretty low, because it was on my mind just constantly, constantly bothering me. So, yeah, it's really improved my quality of life. So, you recommend it to family or friends if they have the same type of symptoms? Absolutely. I plan on telling people. I plan on posting about it. Hey, do you have these symptoms? You should see a specialist if you're in the area. So, yeah. I will be singing the praises of these lenses for sure. Yeah, I'm glad they really help you. What about your skepticism? Yeah, I was going to say, I was really skeptical. The thing is, I could see just fine, and for the most part, everything seemed like the glasses I was wearing was suited for what I needed, but I was having some sort of internal problem. In a way, I was, but really, I just didn't understand how lenses could fix that problem. But these are complex lenses, and they're really amazing, and my husband and I both did all the research. We thought it sounded a little cuckoo, but it was our last thing to try. So, really, it's, I am, I believe it now. Yeah. I'm so glad that they're working out for you. It sounds like such a cliche. I know. At the end, it always gets a little tricky. I'm a believer. Yeah. All right.

       " Document(page_content=\"Here is a perfect eye that doesn't need a prescription, looking to the left. Light is focused by the cornea onto the inner surface of the eye, the retina. This is what is required to see clearly. For our young patients that become myopic, which leads to nearsightedness, their eyes elongate and the world now falls out of focus. Glasses or contacts are traditionally used to correct this blur. But, as myopic parents know, the first pair of glasses or contacts is never the last. When a child wears traditional glasses or contacts, it corrects their central vision. But it wasn't until recently that we learned two new things. First, we learned that traditional glasses and contacts overcorrect their peripheral vision. Second, we learned that the brain pays more attention to the peripheral vision to regulate how the eye grows. Since the brain is watching this region, it grows the eye to land itself back on the plane of clear vision. This cycle repeats itself over and over again into adulthood, leading to worsening vision and eye health.\", metadata={'source': '..\\\\langchain\\\\docs\\\\lumen\\\\docs\\\\youtube_audio\\\\How And Why Do Eyes Worsen？.m4a', 'chunk': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"This is an eye looking straight up towards the ceiling, and this is an ortho-k lens placed on the eye. Ortho-k lenses are shaped differently than standard contacts. They take on what I call a volcanic shape. Ortho-k lenses work by creating negative pressure, also known as suction, in the region under these humps. The cells then migrate and multiply in this region, ever so slightly thickening the zone. The cornea then takes on the shape of the ortho-k retainer lens. Now here's why ortho-k is special. Let's go back to the picture that we sketched in a previous Why do eyes get worse video. Remember how traditional glasses and contacts over corrected your child's peripheral vision, which led to the accelerated growth of the eye? With ortho-k, there's a unique optical effect that occurs. First, it allows your child to maintain clear vision wherever they're looking. Optically, ortho-k lenses cause the peripheral vision to be focused inside of the eye instead of behind it. Because the peripheral vision is focused inside of the eye, it reduces the stimulus for accelerated growth. And without the stimulus for growth, the eye will retain a smaller shape and your child's eyes will remain healthier for life.\", metadata={'source': '..\\\\langchain\\\\docs\\\\lumen\\\\docs\\\\youtube_audio\\\\How Ortho-K Works & How It Slows Myopia.m4a', 'chunk': 0}),\n",

So, a little history on my background is I did LASIK, found out I had Cerebral Conus because after LASIK my vision kept dropping on my right eye. From there, my vision just basically was getting worse and worse. I got crosslinking done, after crosslinking my vision stayed at one point, but since my vision was, I would say, really bad to the point on my right eye where this is the clarity that I needed, like something had to be this close for my right eye to be able to even see it clearly. It was throwing off my vision compared to my left eye, which is a lot stronger. So, slurl lenses has helped me correct my vision where now I'm able to drive and I'm able to do my work and especially needed being in the tech industry, I need my eyes for that reason alone. Yeah, yeah. Prom's a busy guy, so for him to be able to use his eyes without having to think about it throughout the day, just being there for him to be able to see clearer is always important.

Before I had scleral lenses, um, I had, I had gas permeable lenses and they were so uncomfortable and it always felt like I had glass in my eyes. It felt like, um, my eyes were super dry all the time. I travel often, so I needed something that was comfortable and that I was able to wear for long periods of time. Due to my condition, my condition in both of my eyes, I'm not able to wear glasses and see perfectly. So it was kind of mandatory for me to have contacts in order for me to see, um, exceptionally well. Right. Um, the process itself, it was so easy and the receptionist, everyone in Lumen Optometry, they were just answering all my questions that were so, um, flexible with their schedule. As I said earlier, I travel often, so I needed something, I needed a lot of time, um, to, first of all, I live in Marina Del Rey, so I needed a lot of time, um, to get there and they were just all very flexible with, um, their schedules. The other thing I wanted to say is that, um, the scleral lenses are so comfortable. It's so comfortable. Like, you don't even feel that they are. And I was really afraid because of the size of the scleral lenses, I never had anything, you know, that big, um, you know, in my eyes, so I wanted to make sure that it was, um, that it was going to be comfortable and it was. And Dr. Tove, um, definitely made sure that it was before I went home. Um, he, he, him and his receptionist made sure that I knew how to take off the lenses because it's a completely different process, um, than the gas permeable lenses that I had before and they made sure that I knew how to put them on by myself before I went home. So that process itself was, um, very thorough and I appreciate that they could, they were concerned about my health when it comes to that. Um, other than that, like I had an overall great experience. I recommend it to anyone moving forward. I definitely recommend it to my friends and family. Um, they were so easy to work with and they were really, really so happy to answer any of my questions.

And it was, you know, part of my life and I never really imagined anything different. I just assumed that's how it would be.

So let's, let's go, let's go back in time. Tell us about how your eyes work. Okay. So, um, I'm 52 and when I, the last probably five years, my eyes have been getting progressively worse, but it got to the point where I was up to like almost 3.0 readers.

I've been sort of self doing my readers. And so that was it. So then I ended up here and that's when I found out about ortho. Okay. I didn't know about it before. So great. So what's your vision like now? It's great. I don't even need glasses at all. So I don't use that. I don't use readers. My distance is fine and it's the greatest thing ever. I feel like I'm about 25 again. Sounds wonderful. Yeah. I still have patients. It's like where it was specifically when it comes to your situation, right? Because you're farsighted. And so for the longest time, I mean, you didn't wear glasses up until pretty recently. Yeah. Yeah. So your distance was always fairly good. And then all of a sudden your reading starts to go and then your distance follows along with that. Yeah. And I didn't even realize my distance was bad until my eye exam. Like I didn't even think I had, I would never have guessed I even had a little distance issue, but this worked out perfect. I've told so many people, my sister wants to do it.

So, I had pretty moderate astigmatism and myopia. I had LASIK about 13 years ago and thought that I'd have a good long period of time without glasses after that, but unfortunately my astigmatism came back pretty meaningfully. And I tried a lot of different solutions to address it, soft contacts, glasses. I got re-evaluated for TouchUp LASIK, PRK, all kinds of different solutions. And ultimately, the only really comfortable way to address it was through wearing glasses. And after having enjoyed a period of time without glasses after LASIK, I was really looking for another option to go back to being able to go about my day without wearing anything and having kind of easy get up and go routine. And so, after I learned about Ortho-K, I started to research options and that seemed like a good fit for me. Gotcha. So, what's your vision like now? So, after a period of adjustment, it's great. I can see really clearly. I don't need glasses in the morning. I've gotten to a point now where things have settled where I don't even need glasses to read or work during the day. And it's super convenient. I'm really happy with the results. I'm glad. Yeah, the astigmatism is no joke. I mean, you're seeing quite a bit of shadows on things before. A lot of fuzziness, a lot of doubles of things, especially when I read books or when I read things on a computer. And that is like greatly diminished almost to a part where I can't notice it anymore. I know. In the past, when we're looking at the chart there, we're stuck at around 2050, 2070, but now we're really scrutinizing the 2020 line. Exactly, exactly. Yes, I'm super happy about that. Very excited. I'm glad. So, how about your experience? Did you feel as if we took good care of you? Yeah, yeah. I think for me, it was really important to find a place where, you know, you were using like the latest technology, using all the right tools. I think the process that we went through, there were a lot. I felt really good about the quality in terms of both the service and then also the equipment that you're using to get measurements. And then when I got the lenses that also felt really high quality and we've been able to adjust the lenses over time through all the customization that you do to get to a really good fit. And so, you know, for something that I heard by reputation wasn't super comfortable to wear, they're actually pretty comfortable. You know, I don't really notice it when I go to sleep at night. And so, it's all around been a really good experience. I'm glad. And the team is great. Really nice. Everyone's really helpful and the service is really great. Hey, Natasha is really easy to work with. She's super mellow and easygoing. So, thank you so much for telling your story and we appreciate your time. I'm kind of surprised that not more people know about OrthoK actually. I think people have an impression that it's more for younger kids, which is actually how I knew about it in the first place. But having this as an option, not having to do LASIK and deal with all the potential complications, if I had known that this was an option years ago, I probably would have done this instead. Yeah, but a lot of times practitioners who do fit it don't always bring it up for adults because adults are a lot more discerning. Right. So, it does usually take more effort when it comes to adults. Interesting. But I like fine-tuning. I mean, it makes it happy. Definitely, it's more vision-changing, life-changing. Yeah, and having the option to change it over time as my vision changes would have been a meaningful thing to understand about LASIK. They kind of warn you about that, but the way that they position it is when you get old enough to have to use reading glasses, that's when you will go back to glasses. They don't talk about astigmatism coming back, right? And that's, I think, I gather more common than, you know, I understood. So, if I had known that, I probably would have more seriously considered this. All right. Well, thank you so much. For sure.

Before Ortho-K, I used regular soft-faced lenses or just daily lenses that I used to wear. They were extremely dry. I used to just have different eyedrops with me no matter where I went. Whether I was working long shifts at my work or if I was in a room where the fan or the air conditioning was on me, they would constantly dry out to the point where I was blinking and they would just fall out. So, eyedrops were essential and it just became tedious and it just became uncomfortable. So, coming here and finding a whole new, brand new type of solution was extremely nice. And I'm extremely grateful for Dr. To and everything that he's done for me. So, before, do not recommend this new method. I highly recommend and I'm so happy that I made the change. Glad. Yeah, I know with dry eyes, it's definitely not comfortable, especially when it comes to soft contacts. So, what's your vision like now? My vision now is absolutely amazing. I'm really obsessed with it and extremely grateful for everything that the doctor and this business has done for me and that these new contacts have done for me. My vision now, I feel like I'm looking in HD. I'm viewing in 4K. I don't have any blurriness. I wear them for one night when I wake up and I can see everything. I'm usually nearsighted. So, like before I had problems seeing faces far away, reading signs far away. So, driving is fantastic now, like recognizing faces and seeing people, going to work, being able to view and see everything in clear, perfect vision is so nice and I really love it. Yeah, it was exciting for you, especially that day when you came in for the dispense and we placed it in your eye and then by the time we took it off, it wasn't even on for that long. Yes, yeah. When we tried on the lens, we did a couple of tests for like a couple of minutes and then I took them off and I only put them on for like 10 minutes and I was able to see it already. I was so excited to be able to sleep in them and then be able to live my life and live my entire day after all of that. So, very seamless process and yeah, dry eyes are not a problem anymore. I don't have to carry on my liquid eye drops or anything. So, very happy and I just feel like a normal person that can wake up and start my day and not have to worry about one more thing that I have to do. That's wonderful. How about the whole process? Do you feel like we held your hand through the whole thing, that we taught you everything you needed to know? Yeah, coming into this office, a couple of things like setting an appointment is extremely easy. Coming in, they make time for each individual patient. So, when you're here, their full attention is on you. You don't have to wait in a waiting room for 15, 20, 30 minutes. When it's your appointment time, they make that time just for you because they space them out. They give you their full attention. They're really good with doing recurrent and bringing you back every couple of weeks, every two weeks, checking in on you. Additionally, Dr. To will always text you and ask you how you're doing. He'll send you emails regularly. He's very hands-on, makes you very comfortable and really great experience here. I'm really glad that I found this place. Thank you so much. You're welcome.

She ranked as very often under quite a few, and so when she came back for her yearly follow-up this time, she marked rarely for all of those, and so that's always a really, really positive finding. So, I mean, would you recommend it to anybody else if they have the same issues? Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. I already have, but yeah. Absolutely recommend it to everyone. If you have the same issues, it helps a lot, and I've only been wearing them for a year, so. Yeah, yeah, and so I'm glad they're helping you out. I'm super happy for you. So thank you again for your testimonial. I appreciate it. \", metadata={'source': \"..\\\\langchain\\\\docs\\\\lumen\\\\docs\\\\youtube_audio\\\\Relieving Headaches & Back⧸Neck Pain - Christine's Neurolens Testimonial.m4a\", 'chunk': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"All right, so this is Cindy and she came to see us at Lumen Optometric and she's been great. She's been willing to help us out with this video testimonial of her SLARO lenses. So Cindy, when you first came in, what was going on with your current contacts and your issues that you're experiencing? Well, I had ongoing issues with my rigid cast permeable lenses, fogging up, just not clear, needing to take them out several times a day to clean them, to try to see better and I thought, gee, got to do something about this. So I called up the practice and was told that I probably would be a good candidate to look into the SLARO lenses and so I did. Oh, that's great. I remember when you first came in, you had mentioned that you were cleaning them, I think you had almost mentioned once every like 15, 20 minutes or something like that. Yes. Yeah. So it was impacting my lifestyle. I mean, I was nervous to go out because I was always afraid the lenses would fog up while I was driving and having to carry cleaning solution, take them out of public restrooms, clean them, all of that. So, yeah. Super, super comfortable. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So at this point, Cindy's wearing the S-MAP created lenses and so the S-MAP creates a custom scan of the whole frontal aspect of the eye and we create a SLARO lens off of that and I coin these as SLARO 2.0 lenses. So how do they feel? They feel wonderful. I don't even realize they're on my eye. Very, very comfortable. Yeah. It's good to know. And then your prescription is extremely high, so what would you say in terms of stability of your vision? Does it fluctuate like it did with gas permeable lenses? Oh, very stable. So much better. Just put them in in the morning and they stay in all day. Last thing to come out at night and it's been fabulous. Just to kind of get my life back to know I could see clearly all day. All right. Well, I'm glad they're working out for you. Yeah. All right. So we want to thank Cindy for helping us out with the video today. So thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Okay. All right. \", metadata={'source': \"..\\\\langchain\\\\docs\\\\lumen\\\\docs\\\\youtube_audio\\\\Restoring Vision - Cindy's Scleral Testimonial.m4a\", 'chunk': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Okay, so today we have Krista, and Krista is a NeuroLens patient, and she was helping us out with a patient testimonial, just telling her story about her NeuroLens experience. So before you had the NeuroLens, I mean, how did your eyes feel at work when you were staring at the computer? They got very tired. I had a hard time after a while focusing on, like, spreadsheets, for example. I would get headaches, and honestly, I would avoid some of that close work. Yeah, I know, it's not comfortable, especially when we're on the computer for so many hours a day, or a computer, and we're staring at our phones now, too, and so when we think about the NeuroLens, is there a prescribe specifically just for the computer to wear over your contacts, and how does it feel now? Great! A lot better. I put them on only when I'm working on the computer, and I'm able to work comfortably for a few hours at a time, and I'm not getting the dry eye and the headaches that I had before. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, these symptoms do come, for some patients, they all come together. Patients will have headaches, or dryness specifically is a big one. For some patients, they have dry eye symptoms, but their eyes technically aren't dry when we look for signs of dryness, and so sometimes lenses like NeuroLens can ease those symptoms, too. And they've been really helping you out then, right? They have, yes. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I'm glad. Okay, so thank you for sharing your story with us. You're welcome. Yeah.\", metadata={'source': \"..\\\\langchain\\\\docs\\\\lumen\\\\docs\\\\youtube_audio\\\\Treating Tired Eyes - Christa's Neurolens Testimonial.m4a\", 'chunk': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"All right, we have Vivian here and Vivian is going to help us out with a testimonial for her new Ortho K lenses. And so she has a little bit of history about Ortho K and if you could fill us in about it. So I did Ortho K when I was a little bit younger, like when I was 18 and then I did it for a couple of years and I have been using the same lenses for a while and later on I decided to try to switch a lens because my vision has gone a little bit worse. So I wanted to see if there's any chances that I can make my original lens a little bit better. So, and my boyfriend introduced me to Lumen, so that's how I come here. Gotcha. All right. So we're done with our fit now and so what's your vision like? It is perfect. I can see pretty far away. Like it used to have a lot of glares when I wore my older lenses. Now I have less glare and then obviously I can, I can actually look like way better at night because before when I was like trying to like go downstairs, I couldn't really see well and sometimes I even like fall, but now it's like a little bit better. Gotcha. Oh, wonderful. Yeah. I think when it comes to Vivian's lenses, she has a bit more myopia and she has a special type of astigmatism that's more internal. So the lenses have to be able to counter, counteract that astigmatism. That's probably what she had before. And since she had the 100% custom lenses, we were able to mold that out. So as of right now, she has pretty much, she has essentially zero astigmatism residual in both eyes. So what about the fitting process? The fitting process is great. Women really like, really pay attention to a lot of details. When I have any concerns, I would just shoot them a text and they're usually just respond right away. I don't have to like wait a couple of days before I get my answers back. And overall, like on the other hand, scheduling is a little bit more difficult, but obviously any like good practice is going to be like this. And usually they are really punctual. They see you mostly on time. Yeah, yeah. We try. We try. Yeah, I know. Especially during the holidays too, the scheduling gets a little bit, we do get a little bit more booked out. But we try. We like to think even though we're booked out when patients get here, that we give them the full 100%. And so we like to think we're worth waiting for, but hopefully you think that's true. But otherwise, it seems like you're happy and we're glad, so we're always here to support you. Okay. So thank you so much for your testimony.
